Credit: Adapted and used with permission from Amgen A new type of targeted immunotherapy drug shrank tumors in about one in three people with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the most aggressive form of lung cancer, according to results from a clinical trial. The findings are encouraging because little progress has been made in treating advanced SCLC, experts said. Many people with SCLC respond to initial treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. But the cancer usually progresses despite additional treatment, with most of these patients dying within weeks or months. The early-stage clinical trial tested two different doses of an experimental drug called tarlatamab in people with SCLC whose cancer had progressed after at least two previous types of treatment. Many people in the study had already received at least three different treatments. In the trial, tumors shrank in 40% of people given 10 mg of tarlatamab every 2 weeks and in about 32% of people who received a 100 mg dose. Furthermore, in more than half of all patients whose tumors shrank with tarlatamab, the treatment kept the cancer at bay for at least 6 months—and in many, it did so for 9 months or longer. This last finding was especially noteworthy, said Anish Thomas, M.D., of NCI’s Center for Cancer Research, who studies SCLC but was not involved in the trial. “This is probably one of the most promising treatments being tested in small cell lung cancer right now,” Dr. Thomas said. The new findings are “hopeful for patients and the people who treat them, especially since this is such an aggressive disease with very few advances in treatment since the 1980s,” he continued. Results of the trial—known as DeLLphi-301 and funded by Amgen, the company that makes tarlatamab—were presented October 20 at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) in Madrid and published the same day in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The new findings “support the use of tarlatamab in these previously treated patients,” said the trial’s senior investigator, Luis Paz-Ares, M.D., Ph.D., of Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre in Madrid, who presented the results at the ESMO meeting. The findings are “encouraging,” agreed Pilar Garrido, M.D., Ph.D., of Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal in Madrid, who spoke about the trial at the ESMO meeting but was not involved in it. However, she noted that patients need to be hospitalized to manage potentially serious side effects when they first receive the drug, which poses logistical challenges to its use. Dr. Garrido also noted the need for more data on the effectiveness of tarlatamab against SCLC that has spread to the brain and for a biomarker that can predict which patients will respond to the drug. According to Dr. Paz-Ares, the manufacturer of tarlatamab has already launched a large clinical trial comparing tarlatamab with standard chemotherapy in people with SCLC that has come back after one initial treatment. Tarlatamab harnesses T cells to destroy small cell lung cancer cells Tarlatamab is a type of immunotherapy known as a bispecific T-cell engager, or BiTE. These two-armed drugs simultaneously latch onto tumor cells and immune cells called T cells. By bringing T cells and cancer cells close together, they help the T cell recognize and destroy the cancer cell. The arm of tarlatamab that targets small cell lung cancer cells attaches to a protein called DLL3. This protein is normally located inside cells but is often present at high levels on the surface of SCLC cells, where it can be recognized by tarlatamab. That makes DLL3 “a very attractive target in SCLC,” Dr. Garrido said. The trial enrolled more than 200 people with advanced, or extensive-stage, SCLC that had progressed or was no longer responding to treatment. All of the participants had previously been treated with chemotherapy, and many had also been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, a different type of immunotherapy drug. All participants had received at least two prior therapies, and one-third had received three or more. The study team analyzed the response to tarlatamab in 100 participants who received 10 mg of tarlatamab by infusion every 2 weeks and another 88 who received 100 mg every 2 weeks. An additional 34 patients on the 10-mg dose were included in the analysis of side effects. The 40% response rate (tumor shrinkage) seen in the 10-mg group “far exceeded” the 15% response rate that has historically been seen in people treated with standard therapies for SCLC that has relapsed, Dr. Paz-Ares and his colleagues wrote in NEJM. Furthermore, 30% of those patients who responded to the drug had responses lasting at least 9 months. That finding is “exciting,” Dr. Thomas said, because the cancer usually grows so rapidly. The median time that people in the 10-mg group lived after starting on tarlatamab was 14.3 months, compared with 6–12 months with current treatments. Researchers are still following the trial participants to learn more about tarlatamab’s side effects and its impact on how long people live. Based on the initial results of DeLLphi-301, the lower (10 mg) dose of tarlatamab will be used in future clinical trials, Dr. Paz-Ares said. Common and potentially serious side effects of tarlatamab The side effects of tarlatamab were generally “manageable,” Dr. Paz-Ares said, and only about 3% of patients in the study stopped treatment entirely because of side effects. In addition, 13% of people in the 10-mg group and 29% in the 100-mg group had to temporarily pause treatment, have their dose reduced, or both, due to side effects. The most common side effect of tarlatamab was cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction in which inflammation spreads throughout the body. Other common side effects included decreased appetite, fever, and anemia. About one-third of the patients experienced severe side effects, including serious cases of cytokine release syndrome. Severe side effects were more frequent in those receiving the higher dose of tarlatamab. Most cases of cytokine release syndrome were “manageable and typically treated with supportive care,” such as intravenous fluids and drugs to control fever and inflammation, Dr. Paz-Ares said. However, one person in the 10-mg group died from respiratory failure resulting from treatment. Another potentially serious side effect of tarlatamab is ICANS (immune effector cell−associated neurotoxicity syndrome), which includes a host of neurological effects such as severe confusion, attention problems, tremor, and muscle weakness. ICANS was more common in patients in the 100-mg treatment group and led one patient in each dose group to stop treatment entirely. Both ICANS and cytokine release syndrome are commonly seen with immunotherapies that activate T cells to kill cancer cells, including other BiTEs and CAR T-cell therapy. Challenges, concerns, and questions remain Dr. Thomas noted that the trial was not designed to compare tarlatamab with standard therapy for SCLC. “But there is strong historical data on how quickly the disease progresses with standard therapy.” Another issue, he said, is that current practice calls for treating all patients with extensive-stage SCLC with chemotherapy plus an immune checkpoint inhibitor at the time of diagnosis. However, about one in four people in the trial had not been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. So it would be good to know how well tarlatamab works specifically for people whose cancer has come back despite previous immunotherapy, he explained. Possible side effects are also a concern. There were few severe cases of cytokine release syndrome in the trial and most occurred after the first or second dose of tarlatamab. Still, the potential risk of side effects with early doses “is an important consideration,” Dr. Thomas said, because patients had to be hospitalized for a couple of days as a precaution when receiving each of the first two or three infusions of tarlatamab. In addition, people had to be in generally good physical condition to participate in the trial, and the impact of potentially serious side effects could be greater in those who are sicker, he continued. For all these reasons, Dr. Thomas said, it will be important to know “how we can best manage side effects such that we don’t need to admit patients to the hospital, and how we can anticipate, prevent, and treat side effects.” He also pointed out that some patients died within 6 weeks after their treatment began, before the study team could assess if the deaths were due to worsening of the cancer. And “we need to better understand whether these early deaths were due to side effects,” he said. Finally, Dr. Garrido said, another challenge is identifying biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to respond to tarlatamab. The research team looked at DLL3 on tumor cells as a potential biomarker, but whether a person responded to the drug did not appear to be linked to having DLL3 in their tumors, the study team reported. “Despite the many challenges,” Dr. Garrido said, the results “offer renewed hope to our patients.” < Older Post Groundbreaking Trial Results Expand Treatment Options for Some People with Bladder Cancer Newer Post > What Comes after NCI-MATCH?

These exams and tests often include: Taking your health history. Your health care team may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, physical activity and exercise habits. You also may talk about your eating patterns and appetite control. Your health care professional may ask about other conditions you've had, medicines you take, your stress levels and other issues about your health. They may also review your family's health history to see if you may be more likely to have certain conditions. A general physical exam. This includes measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen. Calculating your BMI. Your health care professional checks your body mass index, called BMI. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obesity. Numbers higher than 30 increase health risks even more. Have your BMI checked at least once a year. This can help pinpoint your overall health risks and what treatments may be right for you. Measuring your waist size. The distance around your waist is known as the circumference. Fat stored around the waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Women with a waist that measures more than 35 inches (89 centimeters) and men with a waist that's more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) around may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, waist circumference should be checked at least once a year. Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your health care team will evaluate them. Your health care professional also will check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, underactive thyroid, liver problems and diabetes. Gathering this information will help you and your health care team choose the type of treatment that will work best for you. Care at Mayo Clinic Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your obesity-related health concerns Start Here More InformationObesity care at Mayo ClinicCholesterol testLiver function testsBMI and waist circumference calculatorShow more related information TreatmentThe goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. This improves overall health and lowers the risk of developing complications related to obesity. You may need to work with a team of health professionals — including a dietitian, behavioral counselor or an obesity specialist — to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits. The first treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss — 5% to 10% of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms), you'd need to lose only about 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kilograms) for your health to begin to improve. But the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits. All weight-loss programs require that you change your eating habits and get more active. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your weight, your overall health and your willingness to participate in a weight-loss plan. Dietary changesReducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are key to overcoming obesity. Although you may lose weight quickly at first, steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest way to lose weight. It's also the best way to keep weight off permanently. There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include: Cutting calories. The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. The first step is to review your typical eating and drinking habits. You can see how many calories you usually consume and where you can cut back. You and your health care professional can decide how many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight. A typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men. Feeling full on less. Some foods — such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods — contain a lot of calories for a small portion. In contrast, fruits and vegetables provide a larger portion size with fewer calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you can reduce hunger pangs and take in fewer calories. You also may feel better about your meal, which contributes to how satisfied you feel overall. Making healthier choices. To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods. These include fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Also emphasize lean sources of protein — such as beans, lentils and soy — and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week. Limit salt and added sugar. Eat small amounts of fats, and make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils. Restricting certain foods. Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your health care professional which diet plans are effective and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended. Limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories. Meal replacements. These plans suggest replacing one or two meals each day with their products — such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars — and eating healthy snacks. Then you have a healthy, balanced third meal that's low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. But these diets likely won't teach you how to change your overall lifestyle. So you may have to stay on the diet if you want to keep your weight off. Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. But the reality is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, but the long-term results don't appear to be any better than other diets. Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you're likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To lose weight — and keep it off — you must adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over time. Exercise and activityGetting more physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment: Exercise. People with obesity need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity. This can help prevent further weight gain or maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. You'll probably need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve. Keep moving. Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. For example, park farther from store entrances and take the stairs instead of the elevator. A pedometer can track how many steps you take over the course of a day. Many people try to reach 10,000 steps every day. Gradually increase the number of steps you take daily to reach your goal. Behavior changesA behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes to lose weight and keep it off. Steps to take include looking at your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may have contributed to your obesity. Counseling. Talking with a mental health professional can help address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You also can learn how to monitor your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Counseling can be one-on-one or in a group. Support groups. You can find friendship and understanding in support groups where others share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your health care team, local hospitals or commercial weight-loss programs for support groups in your area. Weight-loss medicinesWeight-loss medicines are meant to be used along with diet, exercise and behavior changes, not instead of them. Before selecting a medication for you, your health care professional will consider your health history, as well as possible side effects. The most commonly used medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity include: Bupropion-naltrexone (Contrave). Liraglutide (Saxenda). Orlistat (Alli, Xenical). Phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia). Semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy). Weight-loss medicines may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. When you stop taking a weight-loss medicine, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost. Endoscopic procedures for weight lossThese types of procedures don't require any cuts, also called incisions, in the skin. After you are under anesthesia, flexible tubes and tools are inserted through the mouth and down the throat into the stomach. Common procedures include: Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty. This procedure involves placing stitches in the stomach to reduce the amount of food and liquid the stomach can hold at one time. Over time, eating and drinking less helps the average person lose weight. Intragastric balloon for weight loss. In this procedure, you have a small balloon placed into the stomach. The balloon is then filled with water to reduce the amount of space in the stomach, so you'll feel full eating less food. Intragastric balloons are left in place for up to 6 months and are then removed using an endoscope. At that time, a new balloon may be placed, or not, depending on the plan determined by you and your health care team. Weight-loss surgeryAlso known as bariatric surgery, weight-loss surgery limits how much food you can eat. Some procedures also limit the amount of calories and nutrients you can absorb. But this also can result in nutritional and vitamin deficiencies. Common weight-loss surgeries include: Adjustable gastric banding. In this surgery, an inflatable band placed around the outside of the stomach divides it into two pouches. The surgeon pulls the band tight, like a belt, to create a narrow pathway between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from getting bigger. The band often stays in place permanently. Gastric bypass surgery. In gastric bypass, also called Roux-en-Y (roo-en-wy) gastric bypass, the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into this part of the intestine, bypassing most of the stomach. Gastric sleeve. In this surgery, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food. It's a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. Other treatmentsOther treatments for obesity include: Hydrogels. Available by prescription, these edible capsules contain tiny particles that absorb water and get bigger in the stomach, to help you feel full. The capsules are taken before meals and are passed through the intestines as stool. Vagal nerve blockade. This involves implanting a device under the skin in the stomach area. The device sends electrical pulses to a nerve in that area, called the abdominal vagus nerve. This nerve tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. Gastric aspirate. In this procedure, a tube is placed through the abdomen into the stomach. A portion of the stomach contents are drained out after each meal.

Lifestyle and home remediesYour effort to overcome obesity is more likely to be successful if you follow strategies at home along with your formal treatment plan. These can include: Learning about your condition. Education about obesity can help you learn more about why you developed obesity and what you can do about it. You may feel more empowered to take control and stick to your treatment plan. Read reputable self-help books and consider talking about them with your health care professional or therapist. Setting realistic goals. When you have to lose a lot of weight, you may set goals that are unrealistic, such as trying to lose too much too fast. Don't set yourself up for failure. Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss. Make small changes in your diet instead of attempting drastic changes that you're not likely to stick with for the long haul. Sticking to your treatment plan. Changing a lifestyle you may have lived with for many years can be hard to do. Be honest with your doctor, therapist or other health care professionals if you find your activity or eating goals slipping. You can work together to come up with new ideas or new approaches. Enlisting support. Get your family and friends on board with your weight-loss goals. Surround yourself with people who will support you and help you, not sabotage your efforts. Make sure they understand how important weight loss is to your health. You also might want to join a weight-loss support group. Keeping a record. Keep a food and activity log. This record can help you remain accountable for your eating and exercise habits. You can discover things that may be holding you back. You also might see what works well for you. You can use your log to track other important health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels and overall fitness. Alternative medicineMany dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The long-term effectiveness and safety of these products are often questionable. Coping and supportTalk to your health care professional or therapist about improving your coping skills. Consider these tips to cope with obesity and your weight-loss efforts: Journal. Write in a journal to express pain, anger, fear or other emotions. Connect. Don't become isolated. Try to participate in regular activities and get together with family or friends periodically. Join. Join a support group so that you can connect with others facing similar challenges. Focus. Stay focused on your goals. Overcoming obesity is an ongoing process. Stay motivated by keeping your goals in mind. Remind yourself that you're responsible for managing your condition and working toward your goals. Relax. Learn relaxation and stress management. Learning to recognize stress and developing stress management and relaxation skills can help you gain control of unhealthy eating habits. Preparing for your appointmentTalking to your health care professional openly and honestly about your weight concerns is one of the best things you can do for your health. In some cases, you may be referred to an obesity specialist — if one is available in your area. You also may be referred to a behavioral counselor or dietitian. What you can doBeing an active participant in your care is important. One way to do this is by preparing for your appointment. Think about your needs and goals for treatment. Also, write down a list of questions to ask. These questions may include: What eating or activity habits are likely contributing to my health concerns and weight gain? What can I do about the challenges I face in managing my weight? Do I have other health problems that are caused by obesity? Should I see a dietitian? Should I see a behavioral counselor with expertise in weight management? What are the treatment options for obesity and my other health problems? Is weight-loss surgery or another intervention an option for me? Be sure to let your health care team know about any medical conditions you have and about any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you take. What to expect from your doctorDuring your appointment, your health care professional is likely to ask you a number of questions about your weight, eating, activity, mood and thoughts, and any symptoms you might have. You may be asked questions such as: How much did you weigh in high school? What life events may have been associated with weight gain? What, when and how much do you eat in a typical day? How much activity do you get in a typical day? During what periods of your life did you gain weight? What are the factors that you believe affect your weight? How is your daily life affected by your weight? What diets or treatments have you tried to lose weight? What are your weight-loss goals? Are you ready to make changes in your lifestyle to lose weight? What do you think might prevent you from losing weight? What you can do in the meantimeIf you have time before your scheduled appointment, you can get ready for the appointment by keeping a diet diary for two weeks before the appointment. You also can record how many steps you take in a day by using a step counter, called a pedometer. And you can begin to make choices that will help you start to lose weight, including: Making healthy changes in your diet. Include more fruits, vegetables and whole grains in your diet. Begin to reduce portion sizes. Increasing your activity level. Try to get up and move around your home more often. Start gradually if you aren't in good shape or aren't used to exercising. Even a 10-minute daily walk can help. If you have any health conditions or are over a certain age — over 40 for men and over 50 for women — wait until you've talked to your health care professional before you start a new exercise program.

The nonprofit, user-driven online encyclopedia is initially an offshoot of another free encyclopedia project called Nupedia founded by Jimmy Wales. However, Nupedia’s reliance on expert contributors makes progress too slow. Then Wales and Nupedia employee Larry Sanger decide to try a complementary project using wiki technology, which allows anyone to write or edit. The new “Wikipedia” is set up as a non-profit supported by donations and grants with Wales donating the bandwidth and server. By May 2001, Wikipedia expands from English to 13 other languages, including French, Japanese, Hebrew, Russian and Chinese. By the end of the first year, another seven languages are in operation or announced ranging from Arabic to Afrikaans to Polish. NOW Eleven years since its debut, Wikipedia is the fifth highest ranked website in the world, attracting about 475 million unique visitors per month. According to Wikipedia, they have about 82,000 active contributors working on content in 283 languages. Roughly 100 of those have 10,000 or more articles with the latest language to reach the milestone being Singhalese last Thursday. English has the most articles at 3.8 million and the next three most popular languages are German, French, and Dutch. While Wikipedia’s rules state that entries must be on notable subjects, neutral, and verifiable, its collaborative nature, also makes it vulnerable to vandals, propagandists, pranksters, bias, and flame wars, among other hazards, the organization openly acknowledges—particularly for newer articles.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)By AAP6/1/2020Updated: 6/1/2020PrintThe Northern Territory will once again see a rotation of United States Marines despite the COVID-19 pandemic.The first of about 1200 U.S. Marines will arrive in Darwin for joint exercises this week as part of a near decade-long arrangement that has been delayed for two months because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Despite the risk of re-introducing COVID-19 to the Top End, which was declared free of the disease nearly a fortnight ago and not had any locally diagnosed cases for eight weeks, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said in early May the six-month rotation would go ahead.Northern Territory Health Minister Natasha Fyles said strict guidelines had been placed on the rotation with all Marines to quarantine for 14 days on a military base when they arrive in Darwin.“There is a very, very low risk to the community,” she told reporters.Each Marine will be screened four days before departure, screened and tested upon arrival in Australia and at the end of the quarantine period.Rotation numbers had been reduced to 1200 with troops coming in smaller groups during June and July and will stay in Australia until September.The Northern Territory’s last two cases of COVID-19 were two defence force members who contracted it in the Middle East and who flew back to Darwin to recover in hospital.The first U.S. service member to test positive was based in South Korea. He had recovered and was released in mid-April after 49 days in isolation.The 2019 rotation consisted of 2500 U.S. Marines and a range of aircraft and other equipment.By Greg Roberts Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowAAPAuthor FollowAustralian Associated Press is an Australian news agency.Author’s Selected ArticlesJudge Faces ‘Inadequate’ Laws in Stabbing SentenceFeb 16, 2024Half of Town Lost to Bushfire as Residents Count LossesFeb 16, 2024Sixteen Homes ‘Uninhabitable’ as Outage Compo CappedFeb 16, 2024Bushfire Evacuees Return to Homes and BusinessesFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsUnited StatesMarinesNorthern TerritoryCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)By Katabella Roberts2/13/2023Updated: 2/13/2023PrintX 10:00SpaceX founder Elon Musk has defended his company’s decision to limit Ukraine’s use of the company’s Starlink satellite internet service for military purposes, noting that the spacecraft manufacturer and communications company will not actively enable an escalation in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.Musk was responding to former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who called on the Tesla CEO on Feb. 11 to “restore the full functionality” of Starlink satellites, adding that Ukraine “desperately needs your continued support.”“Defense from a genocidal invasion is not an offensive capability. It’s survival. Innocent lives will be lost. You can help. Thank you,” Kelly wrote on Twitter.However, Musk replied that the Starlink satellite communication network is playing a key role in ensuring communication in Ukraine but should not be used for escalation that could lead to a World War.“You’re smart enough not to swallow media and other propaganda bs,” Musk responded. “Starlink is the communication backbone of Ukraine, especially at the front lines, where almost all other Internet connectivity has been destroyed. But we will not enable escalation of conflict that may lead to WW3.”Musk’s response comes after SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said on Feb. 9 that the company was restricting Ukraine’s military from using Starlink to control drones in the region for military purposes against Russia.Shotwell, SpaceX’s chief operating officer, said during a conference in Washington that the company’s Starlink satellite internet service was “never meant to be weaponized,” but that “Ukrainians have leveraged it in ways that were unintentional and not part of any agreement.”Shotwell referenced reports that Ukraine’s military had used the Starlink service to control drones and noted that Ukraine’s agreement with SpaceX was intended for humanitarian purposes such as providing broadband internet to civilians well as hospitals and banks after Russian forced destroyed much of the country’s telecommunications infrastructure.“There are things that we can do to limit their ability to do that,” she said, referring to the reports. “There are things that we can do, and have done.”“We know the military is using them for comms, and that’s ok,” Shotwell added. “But our intent was never to have them use it for offensive purposes.”Ukraine Hits Out at SpaceXFollowing Shotwell’s announcement, Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wrote on Twitter that SpaceX, as well as other companies, needs to decide whether it is “on the side of [Ukraine] and the right to freedom” or on “[Russia’s] side & its ‘right’ to kill & seize territories.”“SpaceX (Starlink) and Mrs. Shotwell should choose a specific option,” Podolyak added.Musk’s SpaceX has been providing internet to Ukraine free of charge through Starlink’s satellite internet service since the early days of the invasion but has stressed that it is designed for peaceful uses only.Despite Shotwell’s recent announcement, some Ukrainian soldiers told The Washington Post that the service is working largely as normal for front-line communications but there have been some reports of issues with terminals attached to strike drones.“We’ve had no issues so far, thank God,” Lt. Oleksandr Matviyenko, the commander of a drone-reconnaissance unit working around Bakhmut, told the publication.The Epoch Times has contacted SpaceX for comment.Reuters contributed to this report.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

Friends Read Free(Thinkstock)By Sarah Le8/23/2014Updated: 8/23/2014PrintLOS ANGELES—Imagine transforming the voting process—something considered an almost sacred fundamental right—into something akin to buying a lottery ticket. That’s what the Los Angeles city Ethics Commission would like to do to get more people to come out and vote.Voter turnout is at record lows for Los Angeles city elections. Less than 20 percent of registered voters on average came to the polls in 2013, and less than 10 percent showed up for this month’s special school board election, according to official data.City Ethics Commission President Nathan Hochman said the commission has been looking at many options to encourage people to vote, including penalizing people for not voting. Such a system is used in countries like Australia, where it brings more than 90 percent of people to the polls.But another idea seemed more appealing.“We decided that while sticks are an option, we'd take a look at carrots, incentives,” he said. “One of the incentives that City Council President Herb Wesson was very excited about was the notion of a voter drawing.”After Wesson expressed his interest on Aug. 14, the Los Angeles Ethics Commission voted 3–0 to recommend that the city council consider lottery drawings with cash prizes as an incentive to increase voter turnout. The drawing could be used as soon as LA’s 2015 election.The Ethics Commission proposed using surplus matching funds—which are given to candidates who agree to certain spending restrictions—to fund the lottery. Just one percent of these funds could supply four $25,000 prizes or one hundred $1,000 prizes.But there has been criticism of the idea, too. The LA Times Editorial Board called it “one of the worst ideas we’ve heard in a long time,” noting that it “fails to address the deeper reasons why people don’t vote,” including apathy, ignorance, or critical personal issues.Others are concerned that monetary incentives could skew the outcome of an election by bringing uninformed voters to the polls. But the Ethics Commission says studies show that people who know they are going to vote are more likely to pay attention to the issues.“If we weren’t dealing with a crisis, we wouldn’t be considering any of this,” Hochman said. “For the people who don’t want voter drawings as an answer, we invite you to come up with some other solution that will drive significant more numbers to the polls.”Groups such as the Municipal Elections Reform Commission have suggested that changing the dates of city elections from odd- to even-numbered years to coincide with larger elections would help. They also recommend holding fewer special elections to save time and money for the city and voters. Hochman says these changes could take years.Federal law prohibits paying people to vote, but the Ethics Commission says the federal law would not apply to a purely local election.California and Alaska are the only two states that allow incentives for voting, although the money cannot be used to encourage people to vote for a specific candidate or measure.

Mass Murder Victims During Pandemic | The Epoch TimesOpen sidebarADShare This Article, Friends Read FreeSHAREWorld NewsCanadaMourners Struggle to Grieve N.S. Mass Murder Victims During PandemicFriends Read FreeA memorial is set up across the street from the Debert School, where Lisa McCully, one of the victims of a mass shooting by Gabriel Wortman, taught grades 3 and 4, in Debert, Nova Scotia, Canada, on April 20, 2020. (John Morris/Reuters)By The Canadian Press4/21/2020Updated: 4/21/2020PrintThe death toll from a massacre that stretched across rural Nova Scotia last weekend rose to 23 Tuesday as families grappled with the heart-wrenching question of how to mourn during a pandemic that is forcing people to stay apart.Tammy Oliver-McCurdie, whose sister Jolene Oliver, brother-in-law Aaron Tuck and niece Emily Tuck were among the dead, was struggling with how to plan funerals. The victims have loved ones in both Nova Scotia and Alberta, where the sisters grew up, and the pandemic makes travel difficult.“I don’t know what I’m going to do with this whole COVID thing. It’s just so, so much,” an emotional Oliver-McCurdie said from Red Deer Monday. “I know she’s got people who love her here and people who love her there.”Justin Zahl in Halifax was still searching for answers about his parents’ fate days after seeing images of their Portapique, N.S., home’s burnt remains, all while separated from his younger brother who’s in Albuquerque, N.M. He has no relatives in the province, and the Canada-U.S. border closure is keeping the brothers apart.“I don’t know how I’m going to get my sibling up here,” Zahl said in an interview.Premier Stephen McNeil called the rampage that began Saturday night in the quiet community of Portapique and ended at a gas station in Enfield on Sunday “one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province’s history.”But officials reminded Nova Scotians that the community would have to mourn together from a distance to stop the coronavirus from spreading, as cases and deaths from the illness also climbed.Dr. Robert Strang, the province’s chief medical officer of health, acknowledged at his daily news COVID-19 news conference Monday that it would be “hard for people to hear” reminders about the need for physical distancing in the aftermath of the killings.“COVID-19 is not going to pause because of our pain—we cannot let our guard down,” Strang said.Simon Sherry, a professor in the department of psychology and neuroscience at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said while social and ritualized aspects of grief are important, they represent only one part of coping with death and dying.“At an individual level, people can still make meaning and reach acceptance, even amid a pandemic and the heavy weight of a mass shooting,” he said in an interview Tuesday.On Monday night, people across Nova Scotia were asked to express their grief by stepping outside at 8:30 p.m. to light a candle or shine some kind of light.Others have displayed solidarity by posting photos of sunsets across the province. Toronto-based singing group Choir! Choir! Choir! announced a Facebook live performance of Leonard Cohen’s ‘Hallelujah’ scheduled for Thursday. A virtual vigil is planned for Friday evening, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would attend.Sherry said that kind of new ritual can be an important gesture of solidarity.“When your community, when your province is suffering through grief like this, it’s important to emphasize a connection to community .... It’s important to refocus on community.”A memorial with flowers and tributes sprung up outside the RCMP headquarters in Dartmouth this week to honour Const. Heidi Stevenson, who was killed in the line of duty.But Stevenson’s funeral will look different from those held for slain officers at other points in Canadian history _ like the regimental funeral for Fredericton police constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns in August 2018 that was attended by hundreds of police officers and first responders from across the continent.“It’s going to require some out-of-the-box thinking. I really don’t know where they’re even going to begin,” said Brian Sauve, president of the union representing RCMP officers.He said such events are always uniquely tragic and challenging, but there are possibilities available during the pandemic, such as livestreaming and inviting guests to park along roadways.“There are ways in today’s day and age to honour the fallen,” he said. “It’s just in a different format.”Quentrel Provo, an anti-violence and gun control activist who founded Stop the Violence, Spread the Love in Halifax, led a virtual candlelight vigil Monday night, opening with a prayer, a moment of silence and a reading of victims’ names during a livestream on Facebook.Provo said it was emotionally tough to lead the event, which he set up to offer some hope as Nova Scotians feel overwhelmed by the pandemic and the violence of the weekend.“A lot of tears have been shed. I know myself, I’ve cried a lot in the last few days,” he said in a telephone interview Tuesday.“If we’re hurting, it’s unimaginable the pain the families are going through right now, but we’re trying to come together and be strong and show them support during this time.”Provo said he plans to pay tribute to the victims by lighting a candle each night for the next 20 days, and he said people should continue to support each other and the families into the future.Sherry said people should be careful not to suppress their grief during the pandemic—and it’s important to recognize that people will deal with grief in their own way.“There is no one, particular timeline or course that someone needs to follow as they move through grief, loss and trauma,'' he said.

(ISIS)By Jack Phillips7/5/2016Updated: 7/5/2016PrintThe FBI arrested a former National Guard member on July 3 for trying to “provide material support” to the ISIS terrorist group, according to a Department of Justice press release.Mohamed Bailor Jalloh, 26, is alleged to have provided services to ISIS, also known as ISIL or Daesh, for what he believed would be an attack on U.S. soil committed in the name of the terror group, the Department of Justice said.A now-deceased ISIS member “brokered an introduction” between Jalloh and an FBI undercover agent posing as an ISIS supporter, the statement asserts.READ MOREOhio City Apologizes After Muslim Man Mistaken As ISIS MemberJalloh met with the undercover agent on “two occasions in April and May 2016,” telling them he was a former member of the Virginia National Guard.Jalloh’s case is the most recent of several in which men from the northern Virginia area just outside Washington have been charged with attempting to support the Islamic State group.Court records indicate the FBI saw Jalloh buying an assault rifle Saturday at a gun shop in Chantilly. The affidavit is not clear as to whether authorities believe Jalloh planned to use the rifle himself or whether he may have been procuring it on behalf of an informant. He was arrested Sunday.He also asked the undercover FBI agent if it would be better to plan an attack during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, according to the press release.Jalloh’s sister, Fatmatu Jalloh, told The Associated Press in a brief telephone interview that she is serving as one of her brother’s attorneys. She said she had not yet seen the unsealed charges but denied he was the Islamic State group.Jalloh is identified in the affidavit as a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Sierra Leone.In April, Jalloh told the informant he had been thinking about carrying out a Fort Hood-style attack. Asked to explain, Jalloh said, “Nidal Hasan type of things. That’s the kind of stuff I started thinking,” according to the affidavit.If convicted, Jalloh faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)By City News Service3/1/2021Updated: 3/1/2021PrintSANTA ANA—Orange County may find itself close to the less- restrictive red tier in the state’s program for reopening the economy on March 2.As of Feb. 28, the state’s case rate per 100,000 residents was 8.2, the testing positivity rate was at 4.1 percent and the health equity quartile positivity rate, which measures coronavirus prevalence in hot spots in low-income communities, was 5.3 percent, said Orange County chief executive Frank Kim.“It was a rainbow,'' Kim told City News Service. “For the case rate we were purple, but testing positivity was orange and for the health equity we were red.”As of March 1, the case rate was 7.6, testing positivity rate was 3.9 percent and the health equity rate was 5 percent, “which is the lowest health equity rate we’ve had since we were measured for that,” Kim said.The county’s test positivity rate—which is reported weekly on Tuesdays—improved to 5.4 percent last week from 7.8 percent the previous week, and the adjusted case rate per 100,000 on a seven-day average with a seven-day lag improved from 20.7 to 11.9.Kim said it’s possible the county makes it to the red tier March 2.There is a rule that if a county has two measures in orange but one in the most-restrictive purple tier, it can vault up one spot to the red tier. To move up to a less-restrictive tier, though, a county must stay within those metrics for at least two weeks.To get to the red tier, the county has to have a case rate per 100,000 population of 4 to 7, a positivity rate of 5 percent to 8 percent and a Health Equity Quartile rate of 5.3 percent to 8 percent.The red tier allows for many more businesses and organizations to reopen. For instance, retail stores could allow for half capacity instead of 25 percent, and museums, zoos and aquariums could reopen for indoor activities at 25 percent capacity, as could movie theaters, gyms and restaurants.Knott’s Berry Farm in Buena Park on Monday announced a virtual “National Hiring Day'' on March 13 in anticipation of its plan to prepare for reopening. The theme park is looking to hire about 1,700 people for a variety of jobs throughout Knott’s, including food and beverage, cooks, ride operators, lifeguards and janitorial.The Orange County Health Care Agency reported 179 newly diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and four additional deaths on March 1, bringing the county cumulative case number to 246,634 and boosting the death toll to 3,921. HCA officials reported technical issues with the state’s death reports system, so fatalities might be relatively low over the next several days.The fatality reports are staggered as they come from a variety of sources. So far in January, the deadliest month of the pandemic, the county has reported 1,231 fatalities. December’s death toll stands at 883, while the count for February is at 103.The deadliest day in the pandemic was Jan. 5 when 66 people died of COVID-19-related complications. The December and January fatalities represent 54 percent of the coronavirus death toll since the county’s first fatality on March 19 last year.Hospitalizations due to the coronavirus continued to decline, dropping from 421 Sunday to 419 on Monday, with the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units falling from 132 to 119.The county has 31.1 percent of its ICU beds available and 63 percent of its ventilators, according to the HCA, which reported 5,435 tests March 1 for a total of 3,048,845.

A Wabi Sabi story journey was created to turn the tide in a world where the building of a unique body of knowledge for nursing has fallen into disfavor with nursing itself. Using nature-aligned paintings and a Japanese story-art aesthetic with poetry, the beauty of falling away to unitary essentials and holding the value of “both-and” in unitary consciousness was illuminated. Co-creating art-knowledge may transfigure nursing theory development and its acceptance with cosmic tree-rooted arches.Get full access to this articleView all access and purchase options for this article.Get AccessReferencesChinn P.

However, no studies have compared the efficacy of peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonists in patients with adequate and inadequate responses to prior OIC therapy with laxatives. This post hoc analysis of integrated data from the two previous studies compared the efficacy of naldemedine in patients who were unsuccessfully treated with laxatives [poor laxative responders (PLRs)] with those who either did not receive laxatives >30 days prior to screening or those who only received rescue laxative at or after screening (non-PLRs).Methods:Patients with OIC were randomized to once-daily treatment with naldemedine 0.2 mg or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of responders [⩾3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs)/week and an increase from baseline of ⩾1 SBM/week for ⩾9 weeks of the 12-week treatment period and ⩾3 weeks of the final 4 weeks of the 12-week treatment period]. Additional endpoints included change in SBM frequency, change in frequency of SBMs without straining, proportion of complete SBM (CSBM) responders, change in CSBM frequency, and time to first SBM. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed.Results:The analysis included 538 (317 PLRs, 221 non-PLRs) and 537 (311 PLRs, 226 non-PLRs) patients in the naldemedine and placebo arms, respectively. There were significantly more responders in the naldemedine PLR (46.4%; p < 0.0001) and non-PLR (54.3%; p = 0.0009) subgroups versus the placebo groups (30.2% and 38.9%, respectively). In both the PLR and non-PLR subgroups, naldemedine treatment was superior to placebo on all additional endpoints. Overall incidence of TEAEs in the PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine or placebo was similar.Conclusion:This integrated analysis further supports the efficacy and tolerability of naldemedine in the treatment of OIC and demonstrates a consistent effect in both PLR and non-PLR subgroups.[ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01965158 and NCT01993940]IntroductionOpioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most frequent adverse effect associated with opioid analgesic treatment.1 This condition, defined by Rome IV criteria as new or worsening symptoms of constipation that occur when initiating, changing, or increasing the dose of opioid therapy,2 results from the activation of µ-opioid receptors, which have extensive distribution throughout the enteric nervous system in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.1,2 The reported prevalence of OIC is typically around 50% among patients taking opioids for chronic cancer pain and non-cancer pain.3–7 In one prospective study in cancer patients, about half developed OIC within 2 weeks of beginning opioid therapy.7Unlike other adverse effects associated with opioid therapy, OIC persists unabated over time, even with use of laxatives.8 Opioids interfere with motility, secretion, and sphincter function.9–13 Traditional laxatives (stool softeners, osmotics, stimulants, salines, and rectal options) are often used for treatment of OIC but do not target µ-opioid receptors, to which opioids bind in the myenteric and submucosal nerve plexi of the GI tract; therefore, they do not directly block these adverse effects on GI function.11,14 Studies have reported that 40%–94% of patients taking laxatives for management of OIC have an inadequate response.3,14 As a result, these patients may experience a range of GI symptoms that have a negative impact on quality of life, activities of daily living, and work productivity.3,14 In an effort to reduce GI symptoms, patients may skip or reduce the opioid dose, leading to inadequate pain relief.3,14,15Naldemedine is an oral, once-daily, peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) approved in Japan, the United States (US), and Europe for the treatment of OIC in adults.16–19 The efficacy and safety of once-daily naldemedine 0.2 mg versus placebo in patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC were established in two 12-week studies (COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2) and a 52-week study (COMPOSE-3).20,21 Recent clinical guidelines recommend treatment with a PAMORA when traditional laxatives fail.22,23 Therefore, it is of relevance to examine treatment responses, both in patients with a history of an inadequate response to prior laxative therapy [poor laxative responders (PLRs)] and in those who had not had a poor response to prior laxatives (non-PLRs).The objective of this post hoc analysis was to characterize the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of naldemedine 0.2 mg once daily versus placebo for up to 12 weeks in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain from COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 in PLRs and non-PLRs. No studies have previously examined the efficacy of PAMORAs in these subgroups of patients. We hypothesized that PLRs may represent a specific subgroup of patients who are less responsive to medications for constipation in general, in which case PLR patients may be less responsive to naldemedine than non-PLR patients.MethodsStudy designCOMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 [ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01965158 and NCT01993940, respectively] were identically designed randomized, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase III studies conducted in 68 and 69 centers, respectively, between August 2013 and June 2015.20 Study protocols were approved by independent ethics committees at each site and all institutional review boards (Supplemental Table S1). The studies were performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable local Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations. All patients provided written informed consent. The data from COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 were integrated for this analysis.Table 1.

Patients were not currently using, or were willing to discontinue, laxatives. After discontinuation of laxatives and a 2- to 4-week screening/qualification period to verify OIC symptomatology and eligibility, enrolled patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 12 weeks of once-daily treatment with naldemedine 0.2 mg or matching placebo (Figure 1).20 Criteria for OIC during screening included: ⩽4 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) in qualifying period; ⩽3 SBMs in any 7-day period during screening, and ⩾1 incidence of straining, hard, or lumpy stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, or sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage with ⩾25% of bowel movements. Key exclusion criteria were evidence/history of bowel structural abnormalities, strictures, obstructions, or history of bowel surgery; medical conditions affecting GI transit; history of chronic constipation unrelated to opioid use; and no history of laxative use for OIC.Figure 1. Study design. PLRs were defined as patients who were on laxative therapy prior to entering the study and who stopped its use within 30 days prior to screening. Non-PLRs were defined as patients who stopped laxatives >30 days prior to screening or who only received rescue laxative at or after screening.Non-PLR, non-poor laxative responder; OIC, opioid-induced constipation; PLR, poor laxative responder; QD, once daily; R, randomization.AssessmentsThe primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of responders, defined as patients with ⩾3 SBMs per week and an increase from baseline of ⩾1 SBM per week for ⩾9 weeks of the 12-week treatment period and ⩾3 weeks of the final 4 weeks of the 12-week treatment period.20 Additional efficacy endpoints included the least-squares mean (LSM) change from baseline in the frequency of SBMs per week to each week of the treatment period; the change from baseline in frequency of SBMs without straining (defined as a straining score of 0) per week to the last 2 weeks of the treatment period; the proportion of complete SBM (CSBM) responders, with CSBM responders defined as having ⩾3 CSBMs per week and an increase from baseline of ⩾1 CSBM per week for ⩾9 weeks of the 12-week treatment period and ⩾3 weeks of the final 4 weeks of the 12-week treatment period; the change from baseline in the frequency of CSBMs per week to each week of the treatment period; and the time to first SBM after the initial dose of study drug.Safety was assessed using incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs in the GI disorders system organ class (SOC), and major cardiovascular events.20 Adverse events were coded to SOC and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 16.0. TEAEs were assessed for the population comprising all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication.20Statistical analysisFor the purpose of integration, efficacy data included in this analysis are from first dose up to 12 weeks of treatment in the COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 studies and do not include data collected during the follow-up periods. Efficacy analyses were based on the intent-to-treat population comprising all randomized patients. Safety analyses were based on the safety population comprising all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication.20 The data presented here represent a post hoc analysis of two groups of patients who were either PLRs or non-PLRs. PLRs were defined as patients who, based on concomitant medication records, were on laxative therapy with at least one product prior to entering the study and who stopped its use within 30 days prior to screening.24 Non-PLRs were defined as patients who did not receive laxatives (laxatives stopped >30 days prior to screening) or who received rescue laxative only at or after screening.24Comparisons were made between the naldemedine PLR and placebo PLR subgroups and the naldemedine non-PLR and placebo non-PLR subgroups, as well as the PLR and non-PLR subgroups for patients treated with naldemedine. Analysis of the primary efficacy outcome (proportion of SBM responders) and the proportion of CSBM responders used the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test adjusted for opioid dose strata. A mixed-effect repeat-measures model was used for change from baseline in SBM and CSBM frequency at each week.20 Analysis of covariance using the opioid dose strata as a covariate was applied to the change from baseline in frequency of SBMs without straining.20 Time to first SBM was evaluated using the generalized Wilcoxon test adjusted by study. The Clopper–Pearson method was used to calculate confidence intervals (CIs) for differences between the PLR and non-PLR subgroups for efficacy endpoints.20 Incidences of TEAEs were summarized descriptively and presented along with treatment differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the PLR and non-PLR subgroups. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2.ResultsStudy populationThe integrated efficacy analysis of COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 included 549 and 546 patients in the naldemedine and placebo arms, respectively. Of these, 11 patients in the naldemedine group and 9 patients in the placebo group could not be categorized as PLR or non-PLR. Overall, 317 PLR patients were randomized to naldemedine and 311 to placebo. A total of 221 and 226 non-PLR patients were randomized to naldemedine and placebo, respectively. A summary of the integrated patient demographics, baseline characteristics, and opioid use is presented in Table 1.Patient groups were generally well matched between naldemedine and placebo and between PLR and non-PLR subgroups with no statistical differences between groups, although a lower proportion of patients in the non-PLR group receiving naldemedine was White, and a higher proportion was Black, relative to the other study arms. Additionally, a higher proportion of PLR patients versus non-PLR patients had at least one bowel movement at baseline without a feeling of complete evacuation.EfficacyPrimary efficacy endpointThe proportion of SBM responders in the integrated efficacy population are illustrated in Figure 2. Similar to the overall group, there were significantly more responders in the naldemedine PLR (46.4%; p < 0.0001) and non-PLR subgroups (54.3%; p = 0.0009) compared with the placebo groups (30.2% and 38.9%, respectively). The difference in proportion of SBM responders between the PLR subgroup and the non-PLR subgroup treated with naldemedine was significant (95% CI: −18.1, −0.6; p = 0.037).Figure 2.

There was no significant difference in change from baseline between the PLR and non-PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine throughout the 12-week study period (p > 0.05 at each time point).Figure 3.

However, there was no significant difference in change from baseline between the proportion of SBMs without straining in the PLR and non-PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine (95% CI: −0.72, 0.30; p = 0.42).Figure 4.

However, there was no significant difference between the proportion of CSBM responders in the PLR and non-PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine (95% CI: −15.2, 0.8; p = 0.073). A significant increase in change from baseline in CSBM frequency with naldemedine was established at week 1 with naldemedine versus placebo in both the PLR and non-PLR subgroups and was maintained throughout the 12-week study period (p < 0.001 at each time point; data not shown). There was no significant difference in change from baseline between the PLR and non-PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine throughout the 12-week study period (p > 0.05 at each time point).The time to first SBM was significantly shorter for the naldemedine groups versus the placebo groups (Figure 5). In the PLR subgroup, the median time to first SBM was 18.3 h for naldemedine and 47.5 h for placebo (p < 0.0001) [Figure 5a]. In the non-PLR subgroup, the median time to first SBM was 15.3 h for naldemedine and 44.9 h for placebo (p < 0.0001) [Figure 5b]. No difference was apparent between the PLR and non-PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine [Figure 5c].Figure 5.

Treatment-related TEAEs occurred in 22.2% and 17.0% of PLR patients in the naldemedine and placebo groups, respectively, compared with 19.1% and 9.7% in the non-PLR naldemedine and placebo groups, respectively. TEAEs leading to discontinuations occurred in 4.8% and 3.5% of PLR patients in the naldemedine and placebo groups, respectively, compared with 5.5% and 0.9% in the non-PLR naldemedine and placebo groups, respectively. For both treatment-related TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation, significantly higher rates were observed with naldemedine versus placebo in the non-PLR subgroup but not in the PLR subgroup (Table 2).Table 2.

There were few serious treatment-related TEAEs, with three in the PLR subgroup treated with naldemedine (1%), one each in the PLR placebo group (0.3%) and non-PLR naldemedine subgroup (0.5%), and none in the non-PLR placebo group. One patient each (0.3%) in the PLR naldemedine and placebo arms had major adverse cardiovascular events of myocardial infarction. There was one death in the PLR naldemedine subgroup (0.3%) due to an opioid overdose.DiscussionThis post hoc analysis from two phase III clinical studies demonstrated the benefits of naldemedine over placebo in subgroups of patients either with or without recent prior laxative use for treatment of OIC. Significant improvements from baseline in the mean frequency of SBMs and CSBMs for naldemedine versus placebo were observed, both in PLRs who had OIC despite recent or ongoing laxative use and in non-PLRs with no recent history of laxative use prior to screening, starting at week 1 and were maintained at each week of the treatment period. Response in the PLR group is clinically important, as these patients had already failed the traditional first-line therapy and with naldemedine they have an efficacious and safe alternative treatment option.Comparison between PLR and non-PLR subgroupsThe proportion of responders to naldemedine was slightly but significantly higher in the non-PLR subgroup than in the PLR subgroup, although this finding should be interpreted with caution because the analysis did not include a placebo comparator. No other significant differences in efficacy outcomes were observed between the PLR and non-PLR subgroups in patients treated with naldemedine. We hypothesized that PLRs represent a subgroup of patients that are less compliant or that have pre-existing comorbidities, such as defecation disorders, that may make them less responsive to medications for constipation in general. Although the results of this analysis do not support our hypothesis, the lack of a pronounced difference between the PLR and non-PLR subgroups is not unexpected given that PAMORAs such as naldemedine act directly in the GI tract by reversing the effect of opioids on µ-opioid receptors.19 Laxatives, by contrast, do not address the underlying pathophysiology of OIC.19The presence and severity of OIC symptoms at baseline were generally similar between PLR and non-PLR subgroups. It is also notable that PLR and non-PLR subgroups received the same ranges of opioid doses, underscoring the fact that even low-dose/weak opioids may result in OIC.20,25 On the primary efficacy endpoint, the placebo response rate appeared somewhat lower in the PLR subgroup (30.2%) than in the non-PLR subgroup (38.9%). This observation of a lower placebo response may be indicative of a slightly less responsive population, although the difference may have been due to chance.Adverse eventsNaldemedine 0.2 mg treatment once daily was generally well tolerated for up to 12 weeks in both the PLR and non-PLR subgroups, with the most common TEAEs in both subgroups being GI related. This latter observation is consistent with the mechanism of action of naldemedine.17,19 The incidences of treatment-related TEAEs and adverse events leading to discontinuation were significantly higher among naldemedine-treated patients versus those receiving placebo in the non-PLR subgroup but not in the PLR subgroup, although the PLR and non-PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine showed similar rates of treatment-related TEAEs (22.2% and 19.1%, respectively) and adverse events leading to discontinuation (4.8% and 5.5%, respectively).Definition of PLRThe definition of PLR varies across studies of patients with non-cancer pain and OIC, making comparisons difficult. A prospective study of patients treated with naloxegol prespecified the definition of PLR as those who took medication from one or more laxative classes for a minimum of 4 days within 2 weeks before screening and whose symptoms were rated as moderate, severe, or very severe in at least one of four stool symptom domains on the baseline laxative-response questionnaire.26,27 In contrast, a retrospective study examining characteristics of patients with non-cancer pain and OIC defined PLR as those who had <3 bowel movements and ⩾1 symptom from the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms questionnaire scored moderate, severe, or very severe, despite sufficient laxative use (at least one laxative agent on ⩾4 occasions during a 2-week period).14 Development of a standard definition for PLR is further complicated by the fact that many patients express satisfaction and willingness to continue laxative therapy despite experiencing no or minimal relief of symptoms.28 Nonetheless, response rates in the above mentioned naloxegol study were consistent with the results reported here, with comparable response rates in patients with PLR and in the overall population.LimitationsA limitation of this current analysis is that it was a post hoc analysis of integrated data from the COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 studies. PLR and non-PLR were also defined post hoc. In the current analysis, patients were either poor responders to prior laxative therapy or did not have a recent history of poor response to laxative therapy. All patients had prior exposure to laxatives based on selection criteria. However, it is unclear why the non-PLR group had not been taking laxatives despite having clear signs of OIC (e.g., for financial reasons, whether they had not found laxatives to be successful or satisfying in the past, or whether they were concerned about the potential harms of long-term laxative treatment). Thus, the non-PLR group may have comprised patients with a range of responsiveness to laxatives. Another limitation of the analysis is that comparisons between PLR and non-PLR subgroups did not control for placebo effects. Additionally, as rescue laxatives were allowed if a patient had not had a bowel movement for 72 h, differences between PLR and non-PLR subgroups in the response to rescue laxatives may have confounded results of this analysis.ConclusionData from this integrated analysis further support the efficacy and tolerability of naldemedine in the treatment of OIC and demonstrate that naldemedine has a consistent effect regardless of whether or not a patient had a poor response to laxatives.AcknowledgmentsEditorial and writing support was provided by Adrienne Drinkwater of Peloton Advantage, LLC, an OPEN Health company, and funded by Shionogi Inc.Conflict of interest statementMH was a clinical trial investigator, consultant to Shionogi Inc. and received a stipend for review of the clinical study report.JW received a stipend from Shionogi Inc. for review of the clinical study report.T Yamada is an employee of Shionogi Inc. who may or may not own stock options.T Yokota is an employee of Shionogi & Co., Ltd. who may or may not own stock options.JT has provided scientific advice to Allergan, Kyowa Kirin, Shionogi, and Shire, has been a speaker for Allergan and Kyowa Kirin, and has received a research grant from Kyowa Kirin related to opioid-induced constipation.VA has received speaker and/or consultant fees from Allergan, Bayer, Falk, Ferring, Hexal, Kyowa Kirin, 4M-Medical, Sanofi, and Shionogi.AMD has no conflicts to declare.FundingThe authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: These studies were sponsored by Shionogi Inc., Florham Park, NJ.

Friends Read FreeRudy Lienau attends Shen Yun Performing Arts in Madison. (Valerie Avore/The Epoch Times)By Epoch Times Staff4/5/2012Updated: 8/14/2015PrintMADISON, Wis.—“This show is totally impressive and gives me great respect for Chinese culture. I wish I knew more,” said Steve Holtzman about Shen Yun Performing Arts Touring Company appearing at the Overture Center for the Arts. Mr. Holtzman saw the performance on Thursday night, April 5. Mr. Holtzman’s response is exactly what Shen Yun hopes to achieve, to bring the best of 5,000 years of Chinese culture wherever it tours, and to have audiences gain a new appreciation for this traditional culture. Now retired, Mr. Holtzman, a Madison alderman and a salesman, worked for ELF Technologies. He also served on the Madison Common Council, and on the board of TAPIT/new works Ensemble Theater.“It’s really remarkable that people can perform at such a level,” Mr. Holtzman said of the quality of the performance. Especially intriguing to him was the company’s orchestra, comprised of both Western and Chinese instruments: “It was also interesting to see the way there’s a mix of classical [Western] instruments and the classical Chinese—there’s three classical Chinese instruments right in the center. They’re very prominently featured. “It’s great to hear those instruments in a hall where I usually hear classical [Western] music—to hear them working with the other classical performers ... In fact, that’s one of the reasons I stayed on the side ... because I got a good set line right down to them.” Although Mr. Holtzman is not a musician, his parents taught him to love music. “Those three performers—there’s a flute player, and two-string instruments—they’re just fabulous performers. I’ve never seen those instruments played before.” For Shen Yun itself, Mr. Holtzman expressed his gratitude, “Thanks for coming to Madison.” Reporting by Valerie Avore and Sharon Kilarski. Shen Yun Performing Arts, based in New York, has three touring companies that perform simultaneously around the world, with a mission to revive traditional Chinese culture. Shen Yun Performing Arts Touring Company will next perform in Calgary, Canada, April 8-9.

(Florida Department of Law Enforcement via Getty Images)By Kos Temenes2/11/2024Updated: 2/12/2024PrintX 10:00Mark Epstein, the brother of convicted child sex predator Jeffrey Epstein, described in a recent interview how he went from initially accepting the official ruling that his brother’s death was a suicide to questioning the case of death.Epstein’s body was discovered in his jail cell in August 2019 after he reportedly hanged himself while awaiting trial.Mark Epstein remarked during an interview on Feb. 9 that photographs taken of Epstein following his death could contradict the official narrative of suicide by hanging.The remarks came during an interview with SiriusXM host Megyn Kelly. New York City’s chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, determined at the time that Epstein had committed suicide in his jail cell.Although a forensic pathologist hired by the family of the disgraced billionaire and trafficker questioned that initial ruling, Dr. Sampson stood firmly behind her conclusion, which Mr. Mark Epstein said he had no reason to doubt initially, despite the pathologist’s objection.“I had no reason to doubt it. He didn’t have any children. Our parents are gone. He would know he didn’t have to worry about me. … so, I respected that as his decision,” Mr. Mark Epstein said during the interview.Related StoriesThe Sinister Links Between Jeffrey Epstein, CBDCs, and Bitcoin1/23/2024Cameron Diaz Denies Any Association With Jeffrey Epstein1/8/2024However, he went on to say that upon meeting with medical examiners in New York City at the time, he was informed that his brother’s death could not be called a suicide “because it looked too much like a homicide.”“So then the questions became if he didn’t commit suicide, then he was killed, and then who killed him? How was it done?” Mr. Mark Epstein continued before presenting photos of his brother’s autopsy.Ms. Kelly also said she failed to see how the marks on Epstein’s neck—which looked more like a wire or thin rope had been used to strangle him, as opposed to marks from the alleged bed sheet that was reported to be used in the alleged suicide—could match what was conveyed in the official narrative.“I have a hard time, as a layperson, understanding how a sheet made that mark,“ Ms. Kelly said after being presented with the photos. ”It’s almost like garrote was used or some sort of rope wire.”During the interview, Mr. Mark Epstein also pointed out several other inconsistencies, such as the reported malfunction of the security camera outside Epstein’s cell, Epstein’s body having been moved after he was found dead, and Mr. Mark Epstein’s inability to get answers from the government.The Epstein bothers had been largely estranged since the death of their mother about 15 years ago, only speaking on rare occasions. According to an article published by the Guardian last month, Jeffrey Epstein did not expect to be arrested in 2019, as he believed he was protected under a plea deal 12 years prior, which had granted him immunity. He was found dead in his jail cell less than a month later.Mark Epstein said afterward that he was not satisfied with the official conclusion about his brother’s death and added that he would like the case to be reinvestigated.Recently released documents showed multiple high-profile individuals on Jeffrey Epstein’s flight log of his private jet, including billionaire and Microsoft founder Bill Gates and former U.S. President Bill Clinton.Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the photographs constitute new evidence.

We examined interviews from 13 identified positive deviants living with four different stigmatized health conditions (HIV, leprosy, schizophrenia, and diabetes) in Indonesia. Positive deviance develops in the form of psychological empowerment through improvement of self-belief and perception (intrapersonal component), development of understanding and skill to exert control in life (interactional component), and self-discovery of successful behaviors and strategies to avert stigma (behavioral component). Positive deviants, after being empowered, start empowering others affected by sharing their knowledge and fostering social awareness and acceptance. The findings revealed the presence of problem-solving ability and agency within the community of stigmatized individuals in Indonesia and warrant researchers to partner with the community to expedite the diffusion of transferable positive deviant strategies within and outside the communities.IntroductionPositive deviance is an approach that seeks to solve complex societal problems by uncovering solutions that already exist in the society (Bradley et al., 2009; Marsh et al., 2004). The approach entails identifying individuals called “positive deviants” within the society who have managed to overcome a commonly shared problem by devising their own unique techniques and mechanisms using readily available resources within the community and then learning and replicating those successful strategies to help others in the community (Marsh et al., 2004; Pascale & Monique, 2010). As these unique traits and strategies are derived within the community using resources that are available to all, this approach ensures easy diffusion, uptake, and sustenance of solutions in the community (Marsh et al., 2004; Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010). Studies have highlighted this very scope of positive deviance as an approach to discovering solutions to avert existing health-related adversities in the community (Bradley et al., 2009; Marsh et al., 2004). To date, positive deviance has proven as an effective approach to tackling some of society’s complex health-related problems from child malnutrition (Marsh et al., 2004), smoking cessation (Awofeso et al., 2008), weight loss/control (Stuckey et al., 2011), retention in medical treatment (Assefa et al., 2014), to post-traumatic stress disorder from sexual abuse (Herlof Andersen, 2008).The positive deviance approach may hold promise in addressing the widely prevalent and complex issue of health-related stigma in the society. Weiss et al. (2006) define health-related stigma as “a social process that instigates devaluation, exclusion and rejection of people based on their health condition.” The experience of health-related stigma among people living with health conditions is broadly categorized into two—enacted and felt stigma. Enacted stigma entails the experience of negative social judgment and discrimination, while felt stigma entails internalized shame associated with having a health condition and fear of experiencing discriminatory acts (Lekas et al., 2011; Scambler, 2004). Health-related stigma is a persistent problem in many communities around the world (Kemp et al., 2019; Sercu & Bracke, 2017; Stangl et al., 2019; Woodgate et al., 2020) and is known to negatively affect the quality of life of people living with stigmatized health conditions (Holzemer et al., 2009; Mosanya et al., 2013; Tsutsumi et al., 2007) and hamper the treatment and management of their disease (Sercu & Bracke, 2017; Stangl et al., 2019). Studies have shown that health-related stigma, particularly felt stigma, can be improved through various stigma reduction strategies and interventions targeted towards people living with stigmatized conditions (Dadun et al., 2019; Lusli et al., 2016; Peters et al., 2016; Rao et al., 2019). For example, Dadun et al. (2019) and Lusli et al. (2016) reported significant reduction in felt stigma among people with leprosy in Indonesia through socio-economic and rights-based counseling interventions respectively. However, existing interventions as such are often cost-intensive and non-sustainable in the long run (Kemp et al., 2019). Many of such stigma reduction interventions involve solutions that reside outside the community, which include resources and practices that require heavy investments and adopter buy-ins, and are often managed by external agents with minimal to non-existent involvement of the community (Kemp et al., 2019; Singhal et al., 2010). Studies have shown that community-based interventions that focus on locally derived and -led solutions can be effective (Bogart & Uyeda, 2009), have greater uptake (Seyfang & Smith, 2007), and likely to be sustainable in the long run (McLeroy et al., 2003).The concept of positive deviance has prospects in uncovering sustainable and effective solutions to stigma reduction that are self-derived and already exist within the community, ensuring maximal community uptake and ownership. People living with stigmatized health conditions have their own personal agency, and some succeed to overcome stigma in their lives through such self-derived internal mechanisms and strategies (Peters et al., 2014; Shih, 2004). Insights from the life experiences of these positive deviants can help disentangle the unique mechanisms and strategies used by them to mitigate their negative experiences of stigma and help deconstruct their successful approaches to identify those that can be transferred, practiced, and embedded within the community to help others. Understanding positive deviance can not only help uncover and improve understanding on the mechanism of self-agency, but also help in identification of effective, innovative, and sustainable solutions for stigma reduction that may already exist in the community. However, this has, to our knowledge, not been done yet, and still remains an underdeveloped and underexplored area of research.Therefore, we aimed to explore and understand the process of development of positive deviance to overcome stigma among people living with four distinct health conditions—HIV, leprosy, schizophrenia, and diabetes—in Indonesia. The context of Indonesia as a developing upper-middle income country with high burden of both communicable and non-communicable diseases provides an ideal prospect for this study (IHME, 2010; Kemp et al., 2019; Stangl et al., 2019). Studies have found that Indonesia not only has high burden of infectious diseases, particularly HIV (UNAIDS, 2017) and leprosy (WHO, 2017), and non-communicable mental illness like schizophrenia (HRW, 2016) or a chronic metabolic disorder like diabetes (IDF, 2017), but also rampant stigma and discrimination associated with these four health conditions (Lusli et al., 2016; Pujilestari et al., 2014; Rai et al., 2020; Subu, 2015; Sianturi et al., 2019). Further, studies have indicated that while the cause/origin and severity of stigma may differ across different health conditions, the experience of stigma and their consequences remain largely similar (Rai et al., 2020; Rao et al., 2019; Van Brakel et al., 2019). Taking into consideration such similarities that exist in stigma experiences across different health conditions, we sought to explore the pathway in which people living with one of these four stigmatized diseases in Indonesia develop positive deviance to overcome stigma.Positive deviance approach for social change“Positive deviance (PD) is an approach to social change that enables communities to discover the wisdom they already have, and then to act on it” (Pascale & Monique, 2010).The positive deviance approach strives for sustainable behavioral and social change through identification of solutions that are community-derived, diffused and owned (Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010; Van Dick & Scheffel, 2015). There are many methodologies for the positive deviance approach (Marsh et al., 2004; Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010; Pascale & Monique, 2010). Nonetheless, the characteristics of the different methodologies are very similar. All methodologies acknowledge the importance of identifying the needs of the community, the problem, and the positive deviants. Furthermore, all methods try to discover successful behaviors and/or practices of the positive deviants; this is often called the positive deviance inquiry (Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010). The only difference exists in the final stage of the process, where the steps can lead to either monitoring and evaluation (Marsh et al., 2004; Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010) or continuous research on the positive deviants within a community and extend the positive deviance research to other communities (Fowles, 2007).One of the widely used methodologies is the one proposed by the Positive Deviance Initiative (Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010). This methodology consists of five basic steps, namely, (i) defining the problem; (ii) determining the presence of positive deviants (usually four to six people, as they are rare); (ii) discovering successful behavior that offers solution to the problem; (iv) designing activities using the discovered solution; and (v) monitoring and evaluation. The first four steps are also known as the four Ds (Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010). Within the scope of this study, only the four Ds of the positive deviance methodology were utilized, with focus on assimilating the findings and recommending subsequent actions for the fourth D instead of designing activities.MethodsStudy Settings and ProcedureThis study was a part of an exploratory community-based study on health-related stigma conducted in Jakarta and west Java in Indonesia between March and June 2018 among people with/affected by either of the four stigmatized health conditions—HIV, leprosy, schizophrenia, and diabetes. This study comprised of an exploratory qualitative design to understand the process of development of positive deviance. These four specific health conditions were chosen because of their higher prevalence (MOH, 2013; IDF, 2017; UNAIDS, 2017; WHO, 2017) in comparison to other south-east Asian nations and stigmatization in the Indonesian society (Lusli et al., 2016; Peters et al., 2013; Pujilestari et al., 2014; Subu, 2015; Sianturi et al., 2019). Participants were recruited purposively from the community through referrals from community-based organizations and peer-support groups. Those who were over the age of 16 (age of consent) and who were willing and consented to participate were included in the study. This study was based on in-depth interviews.Selection of Positive DeviantsA multi-stakeholder consultation with local researchers, community leaders, peer leaders, and representatives of community-based organizations was undertaken to identify positive deviants across the four conditions. The role of the stakeholders in this study was limited to the identification, selection, and recruitment of the participants. As per the consultation, a four criteria definition for positive deviants was derived. Positive deviants were those who (i) successfully managed to overcome stigma in their lives, (ii) were not ashamed of their disease, (iii) innovated unique mechanisms and ways to avert stigma, and (iv) managed to reintegrate into the society. A two-step identification and recruitment of positive deviants was then conducted. In the first step, 21 individuals (HIV: 6; leprosy: 6; schizophrenia: 5; diabetes: 4) were identified through referrals from local resource persons. This took place in different ways for each condition: possible positive deviants with leprosy were identified in Cirebon through recommendations from peers and resource persons from local leprosy-related organization, those with HIV and schizophrenia were identified through peers and community-based organizations in Jakarta, and those with diabetes were recruited through peer-recommendation and patient support groups in Jakarta. In the second step, the identified positive deviants were further confirmed through preliminary in-depth interviews using the aforementioned criteria. Based on the interviews, 13 positive deviants were finally selected (HIV: 4; leprosy: 3; schizophrenia: 4; diabetes: 2). A final consultation was conducted among the research team and community stakeholders for consensus on the selection of positive deviants.Data CollectionQualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with identified positive deviants. Informed consent was sought prior to participation in the study. Those who agreed were either interviewed in their homes or at the NGO offices in privacy. Prior to interview, sociodemographic information on age, gender, ethnicity, religion, income, etc. was collected from the participants. The interviews started in an exploratory manner and progressed toward more in-depth questions to uncover the participants’ self-reported trajectory/process of positive deviance. On average, the interviews lasted an hour. During the interviews, a guide was used (Supplementary File 1). The following topics were addressed by the interview guide to uncover the development of positive deviance: general information, life history, experience of living with the health condition, experience of stigma and discrimination, turning point in life, strategies used to avert stigma, perceived changes after overcoming stigma, and current works and activities. Focused probing was conducted to discover successful strategies and behavior employed by participants to mitigate stigma in their lives. The interviews included exhaustive probing along with member check/respondent validation to ensure trustworthiness of the collected data. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Data management and analysis were performed using Atlast.ti software.Data AnalysisData analysis was independently carried out by the two co-authors—one from the field of global health (Sarju Sing Rai) and other from psychology (Elena Syurina). The obtained codes were discussed among the authors: common codes were combined, while the different and discrepant codes were further deliberated on and noted. All such codes/categories were discussed with and agreed upon by all co-authors in each stage of the analysis to make final decisions on the codes/categories. The constructivist grounded theory approach outlined by Charmaz (Charmaz, 2014) was used for data analysis. Using Charmaz’s approach, data analysis entailed an extensive process of coding and memo writing. The analysis was conducted as follows:Initial CodingThe transcripts were read line-by-line and incident-by-incident coding was conducted within each interview to obtain the initial codes.Focused CodingAfter obtaining the initial codes, they were compared across the interviews from all positive deviants. Codes were first clustered into categories based on the two preliminary evolving themes that emerged from analysis—development of positive deviance and impact of positive deviance. As the coding process proceeded, it became clear that some of the categories corresponded to most positive deviants, which became the main theoretical categories. There were some categories that were less mentioned and formed sub-categories. The codes were then categorized and preliminary categories were obtained.Theoretical CodingIn the theoretical coding process, the categories obtained through focused coding from all 13 interviews were further studied, compared, and organized. The process entailed interlinking and synthesizing of those categories that led to integration of interrelated categories into themes. Three main themes emerged from theoretical coding, viz. “triggers” that led to positive deviance, “empowerment” as an actual process of positive deviance, and “impact” of positive deviance. Under each theme were interrelated categories and sub-categories. The process of theoretical coding led to a preliminary theoretical framework obtained through assimilation and thematic conceptualization of interrelated categories.Application of Extant Theoretical ModelsAs per the constructivist grounded theory approach, the resultant theoretical concepts were compared with existing relevant literature in the later stage of data analysis. The theoretical categories pertaining to the theme “empowerment” was found to bear strong similarity to the existing theoretical models of psychological empowerment. Upon further review and comparison, the authors deemed fit to integrate the theoretical concept of “empowerment” into the existing theoretical model of psychological empowerment by Zimmerman (Zimmerman, 1995).Zimmerman’s psychological empowerment model (Zimmerman, 1995) was used to describe the process of development of positive deviance. The model posits that psychological empowerment entails three components, viz. intrapersonal, interactional, and behavioral component, which all work together in unison to empower an individual. The first component—intrapersonal empowerment—refers to how individuals think about themselves and perceive control, self-efficacy, and motivation in their lives. This component is about the individual’s perception of self-esteem, self-view, and locus of control. The second component—interactional empowerment—refers to the critical awareness and understanding people have about their condition, community, and society (norms, structures, etc.), and the ability and skillset individuals have to make a change. This component posits that individuals need to learn about their options and scenario in a given context in order to be able to exert control in their environment. The final component—behavioral empowerment—occurs when individuals have both intrapersonal and interactional empowerment to drive a positive behavior change. Behavioral empowerment refers to actual actions/behaviors/strategies undertaken to make a change and directly influence outcomes in one’s life (Zimmerman, 1995).Memo WritingMemo writing was a crucial part of the entire data analysis process as outlined by Charmaz (Charmaz, 2014). The authors wrote down memos on the evolving codes and resultant categories and themes in every step of the analysis. The memos helped in thorough reflection, comparison, and elucidation of the emerging codes and categories and guided the whole analytical process.Final Theoretical FrameworkA final theoretical framework of the process of development of positive deviance was obtained after integration of the main themes with the extant theoretical model. The final theoretical model includes four thematic stages that underline the process of development of positive deviance among the participants.Rigor of StudyThe analytical process was peer debriefed and discussed in each stage to ensure the quality and trustworthiness of codes, categories, and themes. The authors made sure all codes, categories, and themes were obtained until the point of saturation. The results of the analysis were carefully reviewed and refined in all stages. Rigorous vetting and deliberation were carried out among the authors in determining the causal and consequential relationships between the categories and developing the preliminary theoretical framework from thematic coding, and then integrating the theoretical concepts into existing theoretical models after literature review. The final framework was thus obtained after consensus from all authors on the final themes and the logical connection and pathway they describe. An outline of the analytical process and resultant outcomes in each stage of analysis is presented in Supplementary File 2.Ethical ApprovalThis study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of Atma Jaya Catholic University, Indonesia (Approval ID: FR-UAJ-26-13/R0). All participants provided verbal and written consent to participate in the study.ResultsDemographic Information About ParticipantsA total of 13 individuals were identified as positive deviants. Out of them, four were living with HIV, three were affected by leprosy (two with visible physical impairments), four with schizophrenia, and two with diabetes (with no diabetic complications and resulting impairments). There were six male and female respondents, while one identified as transgender. The majority of the respondents belonged to Jawa and Sunda ethnicity (67.6%), and followed Islam (69.2%). The median age of the positive deviants was 41.31 years (SD 14.22) with an age range between 20 and 75. The mean duration of living with/having had the condition was 12.31 years (SD 5.99) with a range between 1 and 25 years.The Process of Development of Positive DevianceThe final theoretical framework obtained from the constructivist grounded theory analysis described four stages of the process of development of positive deviance among the participants: (i) initiation, where specific triggers helped initiate the process of psychological empowerment among positive deviants, (ii) self-strengthening, where the process of psychological empowerment repeated in a loop while further strengthening its components, (iii) impact, where after being empowered, positive deviants started helping others and contributing to the society, and (iv) reinforcement, where the process of impact and psychological empowerment repeated in a reiterative cycle, enriching each other in every iteration. The framework illustrating the four stages of development of positive deviance is outlined in Figure 1.Figure 1. The process of development of positive deviance.InitiationTheoretical coding showed that participants developed positive deviance through psychological empowerment. The process of psychological empowerment adapted from Zimmerman’s model (1995) constituted three components:a. Intrapersonal component: Positive deviants reported of intrapersonal component of psychological empowerment that helped them improve their self-belief and perception and led them to take charge of their lives. The categories of intrapersonal component included: (1) “self-acceptance,” wherein positive deviants talked about how accepting themselves and their health condition was the first step to feeling better about themselves and improving self-esteem; (2) “self-confidence,” which played an important role for them to be self-aware of their ability to perceive control of their life; (3) “positive outlook,” wherein positive deviants reported of having positive insights and outlook to life, which ignited a sense of hopefulness and normalcy in their lives; and (4) “motivation,” which provided them the incentive to keep going on and striving for better.Motivation was further categorized into three sub-categories based on its sources: (i) “empathy towards other stigmatized individuals,” where motivation came from being able to relate to others living with the same health condition as them and having empathy towards them; (ii) “experience of stigma/discrimination,” wherein motivation came from the experience of stigma in their everyday life from family, friends, and healthcare professionals; and (iii) “concern for loved ones,” where motivation came from the concern that positive deviants had for their loved ones—especially close family members (children, spouse, father, mother, etc.).b. Interactional component: Positive deviants reported of interactional components that helped them develop critical awareness and understanding of their disease and the environment, and gain skills to manage stigma. This included (1) “experiential knowledge,” wherein positive deviants reported of how their personal experiences of living with the health condition provided a better understanding of not only their disease but also the context of stigma surrounding them; (2) “information,” wherein they talked about how gaining relevant knowledge and information, either from other experts or through information resources, helped them understand their disease and think of ways to manage them; (3) “situational assessment and awareness,” in which they talked about the importance of having a critical awareness of the environment and the social norms in one’s daily life, and understanding measures to fit-in as a way to avert stigmatization; (4) “disclosure considerations,” wherein they highlighted the importance of understanding the people, their beliefs and specific contexts before disclosing one’s health status to others; (5) “support from others,” where they talked about how perception of support from others, especially family and friends, provide positive reinforcement in their lives; and (6) “resource mobilization skills,” wherein positive deviants discussed how critical awareness of available resources or ways to accessing different resources is paramount to effective management of their life.c. Behavioral component: Behavioral component in this study entails successful behavior changes exhibited by the positive deviants to overcome stigma. Positive deviants reported of two different concepts of behavior change—“personal changes” that helped them in their everyday life to overcome stigma, and ‘transformational leadership’ in which they started helping others affected to fight against stigma.Personal changes included behaviors like (1) “self-care,” wherein positive deviants highlighted the importance of caring for themselves for not only effective management and treatment of their disease but also for overall well-being. Self-care entailed both physical/medical care (taking medications regularly, following through with health check-ups, etc.) and spiritual care (meditation, prayers, etc.); (2) “indifference to others’ stigmatizing views/behavior,” wherein they talked about how they ignored and did not care about what others thought of them or talked about them. By this point, they perceived enough control of their life and environment that the public views did not affect them; (3) “disclosure of one’s status,” wherein disclosure of their health status was a very important action for positive deviants, which they said not only helped them feel liberated from shame and stigma associated with their disease, but also helped garner support and understanding from others; (4) and “situational adjustments to assert control of the environment,” where they talked about how adjusting according to different contexts, cultures, and situations help them avert stigma and judgment in their daily lives. They highlighted the importance of critical awareness of the environment and norms in helping decide the required adjustments needed.Transformational leadership included behaviors like (1) “leading by example (being a role model),” wherein having understanding and empathy towards others living with their health conditions, positive deviants discussed how they started helping others by showcasing their own life experiences of living with the condition and mentoring and guiding them; (2) “helping and supporting peers,” where positive deviants actively helped others affected through actions like home visits to track their treatment, emotional support and counseling, connecting/referring them to relevant people within their network, lending money when in need, etc.; (3) “activism,” wherein they talked about their passion to fight for their rights and those of other people affected. They showed aversion to inequality and injustice and actively spoke against those, while demanding equality and justice; and (4) “advocacy,” wherein some positive deviants reported of going a step further ahead from activism towards advocacy where they systematically worked with different stakeholders on affecting policy changes to improve the condition of people living with the health condition as them.A summary of the categories of the three aforementioned components, their description, and illustrative quotes are provided in Supplementary File 3.Role of Triggers in Initiating Psychological EmpowermentPositive deviants were found to already have different levels of intrapersonal and interactional component, as they had already gone through various experiences and exposures in their lives to provide for these two components of empowerment. However, to initiate the process of psychological empowerment, the two components needed to lead to behavioral component (i.e. to initiate behavioral changes to avert stigma). For this to happen, a “trigger” was necessary, which the participants called “the turning point in their life.” Triggers were found to act like sparks that started the process of psychological empowerment by either driving interpersonal or interactional component that ultimately led to behavior change.For positive deviants who had adequate interactional component but lacked sufficient intrapersonal component, a trigger in the form of added motivation helped in initiating the empowerment process. The motivational trigger came in different forms. For some positive deviants, motivation came after remission of their disease or improvement of their health after treatment. For others, motivation took shape in the form of indignation and revolt against discrimination. One positive deviant living with HIV gave an account of how at first she was complacent and tolerated discrimination from others, but when it was directed to her loved ones—she revolted: “[…] as long as the discrimination was only directed to me... […] I just accepted it. But…when I saw people close to me getting discriminated against, I got angry. […] my husband needed to get operated and we got denied from hospital […]. I ended up getting really angry. I reported it to ministry of health and I took it to the media. I ended up meeting the president of the hospital because I also didn’t want it to get to the media. (Female, HIV)”In case of positive deviants with adequate intrapersonal component but not enough interactional component, a trigger in the form of information that built their knowledge and skill helped strengthen interactional empowerment to drive behavior change and initiate the process of positive deviance. Information received through internet, social media, friends, family, healthcare professionals, and other individuals living with the condition (peers) helped ignite their passion to make positive change(s) in their lives. One positive deviant living with HIV who was in prison when tested positive for HIV recounted his experience of how information helped trigger positive deviance in his life: “The information that I got inside (the prison) … about HIV was limited. […] So, I called my friends and told them about my status, wishing they could look for books [on HIV]. But it turns out there were none, it was not that easy. […] I could only look at it from google, but Information that I got were limited. I tried to look for more information…luckily, there was a doctor from America who was conducting research inside the prison, so he/she told us […] as long as you have HIV, you could get medication to treat HIV. Knowing that, I fought for my rights and started arguing why we needed to wait until our condition got worse, if we were ready! (Male, HIV)”Triggers initiated psychological empowerment in the lives of the respondents in different stages of their lives. Some positive deviants encountered triggers at the earliest point when they came to know of their disease status, while for some it took a longer time—until a specific event or experience drove them to make changes in their lives. Further, the strength of triggers also differed as per individuals. For some, triggers had to be strong and cathartic to catalyze positive change like a traumatic experience of discrimination, while for some, they were very mild and gentle, much like an epiphany.Self-StrengtheningOnce initiated, the process of psychological empowerment was found to strengthen further by functioning in a reiterative loop, with each empowerment component leading to strengthening of either of the other two components, and so forth (see Figure1). One positive deviant with schizophrenia described this process which started with him recovering and feeling better and confident (intrapersonal empowerment), which led him to actively search for information and resources regarding his condition and learning ways to improve it (interactional empowerment), finally leading to making important changes in his life to improve his condition (behavioral empowerment): “I recovered (from schizophrenia) and I started looking more into what was I sick with. I looked it up (in google) and I learned that the symptoms matched with mine. But I did not stop there and started looking for more. I created my Facebook account […] and I found KPSI (NGO on Schizophrenia) and contacted them. After meeting others like me I was then sure that the pills really do help with our recovery. So, I regularly took my pill from 2010 until now. Thank God I haven’t relapsed since then. (Male, Schizophrenia).” Positive deviants, once entered into the process of psychological empowerment, were found to undergo the process reiteratively further building up on each of the three components that led to self-strengthening with time.ImpactWith initiation, development and strengthening of psychological empowerment, the positive deviants ultimately sought to bring about two distinctive impacts—directed toward others living with their health condition and toward the outside world. The first type was to strengthen and empower other stigmatized individuals from their group through “knowledge diffusion.” Positive deviants reported of how they were able to help others understand their disease and ways to manage it and avert stigma and other adversities in life. They talked about sharing with others the behaviors and strategies they used in their own lives, which helped them. One positive deviant with HIV talked about the advice he gives to others living with HIV: “I feel happy that I have been able to help others with HIV. I always tell them that accepting yourself first is the most important thing. If you can't accept yourself, how will others accept you. If you are able to accept yourself, others will follow. Even if others can’t accept you, at least you can accept yourself. (Male, HIV).”The second impact was to “foster wider social awareness and acceptance” of people living with the condition. Positive deviants talked about their yearning for acceptance and inclusion in the society, for which they made sure to portray a positive picture of how people with health conditions as them are just like any other person and are a productive member of the society. One positive deviant with HIV explained: “[…] I always try to show people that despite of having HIV, I am a productive person who contributes to the society. People will set aside the fact that you have HIV…. even if you’re gay and LGBT ….if they see you have skills and are productive. I taught in some government agencies and they don’t care that I have HIV, they just appreciate what can I give to the company. So that’s what I always emphasize “what can you give to other people?”. If you do good things, people will respect and appreciate you. (Male, HIV).”ReinforcementSuccessfully achieving impact was found to further encourage and reinforce the positive deviants’ psychological empowerment, which in turn encouraged them to strive for more impact—thus creating a reiterative positive loop between the process of psychological empowerment and the resultant impact (as illustrated in Figure 1). Positive deviants talked about how they felt more driven and motivated and strived to work harder to help others after seeing the positive impact they have been able to bring in the community and to people’s lives. One positive deviant with leprosy said in regards to helping others affected by leprosy: “When I saw how I was able to motivate other people with leprosy, I became even more motivated. I started learning new skills and working with other villagers to improve our village infrastructure. I showed everybody that even though I have leprosy, I can positively contribute to the society. Seeing my work, my friends with leprosy are even more motivated. … (Male, Leprosy).” Another positive deviant with HIV talked about how he managed to show the public that “people with HIV can equally contribute in the society” by teaching aerobics to the police, and reported receiving a lot of support from the public, which further fueled his desire to do more to improve their understanding and perception towards people living with HIV in the society.DiscussionThrough this study, we attempted to explore and understand the process of development of positive deviance among people living with stigmatized health conditions in Indonesia as a way to avert stigma. Positive deviants exhibited psychological empowerment triggered by their unique life events and experiences. Once initiated, the process of psychological empowerment was found to self-strengthen by functioning in a reiterative loop—with each empowerment component leading to strengthening of either of the other two components and so forth. With initiation and self-strengthening of psychological empowerment, the ultimate impact that the positive deviants were trying to bring about were empowerment of other stigmatized individuals from their group through diffusion of successful strategies in the community and striving for social change by fostering wider social awareness and acceptance of people living with the condition. The processes of impact and psychological empowerment were found to repeat in a reiterative cycle, enriching and building upon each other in every iteration.Positive deviance developed in the form of psychological empowerment which helped individuals overcome the experiences of stigma and related adversities in everyday life. Depending on the field of research and the setting, positive deviance can take different forms (Herlof Andersen, 2008; Marsh et al., 2004). Among Vietnamese farmers facing the issue of child malnutrition, positive deviance came in the form of going against the community tradition and diversifying the children’s diet to include other macronutrients other than just carbohydrates (Marsh et al., 2004). For men dealing with childhood experience of sexual abuse, positive deviance took shape in the form of focusing and building on a positive identity that identifies less with the experience of abuse (Herlof Andersen, 2008). In this study, psychological empowerment was indicative of positive deviants’ ability to perceive control in their life (interpersonal empowerment) and develop understanding of the social contexts and systems and ways to maneuver them (interactional empowerment), which enabled them to exert required actions to bring about positive changes in their lives that helped them overcome stigma and related adversities (behavioral empowerment) (Zimmerman, 1995).Further, once the process was initiated, the three components of psychological empowerment reiteratively self-strengthened each other while also leading the positive deviants to make an impact by empowering others and fostering public awareness. This in turn further strengthened the process of psychological empowerment among positive deviants that again led to more impact—thus creating a positive reiterative loop. This is consistent with Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 2001) which posits that positive psychological processes often enhance and grow in each thought-action repertoire creating an upward spiral. Studies on positive psychology have demonstrated this particular phenomenon where positive processes like coping with adversities, psychological resilience, and emotional well-being keep building and growing in a cyclical manner with each positive thought-action repertoire (Aspinwall, 1998; Fredrickson & Joiner, 2002).The findings indicate that psychological empowerment can be an effective way to overcome stigma among people living with stigmatized health conditions. This corroborates with the works of Oyserman and Swim (2002) and Shih (2004) which posited that empowerment can help stigmatized individuals overcome adversities caused by stigma, build self-efficacy, and reject negative labels associated with their stigmatizing trait. This may be a possible mechanism that can lead to reduction of felt stigma. Hence, interventions focused on psychological empowerment may have prospects in stigma reduction among those living with different health conditions. However, there may be two different approaches to designing such interventions. The first approach is the conventional etic empowerment approach led by external agents (researchers, program managers, etc.) whereby specific interventions are designed and introduced targeting the different components of psychological empowerment (Chopra & Ford, 2005; Sadan, 1997). Studies have indicated that such interventions can be effective (Eisman et al., 2016; Peterson & Reid, 2003). Eisman et al. found that targeting the three empowerment components not only improved the overall psychological empowerment, but also increased the likelihood of positive behaviors among youth (Eisman et al., 2016). Further there have been stigma reduction interventions focused on empowering people living with stigmatized health conditions, which have shown promising results in reducing felt-stigma (Dadun et al., 2019; Ebenso et al., 2007; Peters et al., 2016). However, studies have found that such interventions are often resource-intensive, have poor uptake by target beneficiaries, and not sustainable on the long run (Singhal et al., 2010; Singhal & Svenkerud, 2019; Stangl et al., 2019). This may not only have happened because of the obvious reason that the etic approach is often designed and led by external agents, but also because such interventions extensively focus on successful strategies which may work only in context of certain individuals and settings, and not the wider community.It is important to understand that for individuals like positive deviants, psychological empowerment is a self-derived mechanism, while for others, it might not be as obviously feasible. It can therefore be beneficial to follow a second approach—the positive deviance approach (Marsh et al., 2004; Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010; Pascale & Monique, 2010) that focuses in identifying the most usable and transferable behaviors or strategies employed by positive deviants that can be easily implemented, practiced, and shared by others in the community, which may help lead those who are not positive deviants into the path of psychological empowerment. For example, strategies such as selective disclosure of one’s health condition can be emulated by people living with stigmatized health conditions. As opposed to full disclosure, selective disclosure entails disclosing of one’s health condition to a selected group of people who the stigmatized individual trusts and/or expects understanding and support from (Corrigan & Rao, 2012). While this strategy may not help individuals fully mitigate stigma as feelings of shame and apprehension may still exist, it is known to provide a needed reprieve to stigmatized individuals by gaining supporters/confidants and getting a sense of control of how, when and who they disclose their health condition to (Black & Miles, 2002; Corrigan & Rao, 2012). This strategy has already proven effective among people living with HIV (Black & Miles, 2002; Kumar et al., 2015) and mental illness (Bos et al., 2009; Corrigan & Rao, 2012) in coping with stigma. Hence, such positive deviant strategies have prospects for broader acceptance, ownership, and practice in the community as they are derived from people from the community with similar experiences and contexts (Pascale & Monique, 2010). The positive deviance approach may thus have the answer to designing future stigma interventions that are not only effective but also sustainable.Positive deviants living with stigmatized conditions had passion and drive to help others in the community and yearned to make an impact among both other stigmatized peers and the society. Besides helping other stigmatized individuals, becoming role models, and advocating for their rights, they shared personal stories and specific strategies in their community. This may have already led to a diffusion of innovation (transference and transformation of tacit knowledge to implicit knowledge) within their community. Studies on psychological empowerment have shown that people who are empowered tend to empower others (Eisman et al., 2016; Sadan, 1997; Zimmerman, 1995). Eisman et al. (Eisman et al., 2016) found that psychological empowerment among youths in turn helped increase their prosocial involvement and contribution to the community. Positive deviants were further involved in advocacy to help other oppressed stigmatized individuals. This is consistent with the findings from Sadan (Sadan, 1997) who noticed that empowered individuals focused on advocacy to ensure even the weakest people can access empowerment process by creating the minimal environmental conditions.Further, they strived for social change and were known to put themselves out in the public eye to foster understanding and awareness of their condition. They aimed to elicit public understanding and empathy toward themselves and other people living with their condition—paving the way to social acceptance, reintegration, and possible inclusion. Sadan (Sadan, 1997) noted similar behavior among empowered people where empowerment extended beyond personal context like individual achievements—toward a path of social transformation. On discovering one’s right and ability to control one’s destiny, empowered individuals were known to systematically change their lives and environment, and consequently strive for social and political change (Wallerstein & Bernstein, 1994; Sadan, 1997).The findings from this study show prospects of the positive deviance approach to catalyze social change from within the community and provide comprehensive information on the “know-how” for those affected to empower themselves and overcome stigma and its negative effects. However, it is also important for the external agents and environment to also facilitate the process of social change. As per the social change theory it is important to influence both the normative and social structures in order to bring about social transformation (De La Sablonnière, 2017). The positive deviance approach is mostly focused in the normative level (Pascale & Monique, 2010; Singhal et al., 2010). While the approach may extend to exert influence on the social structural level (Marsh et al., 2004), the attempt may still fall short. In order to deal with a deeply rooted and complex issue of health-related stigma, it is important for allies from outside of the community to help in efforts to effect change in the social structural level (Singhal et al., 2010; De La Sablonnière, 2017; Singhal & Svenkerud, 2019).In this context, researchers, community leaders, and health program managers have an important role within the positive deviance approach that first and foremost includes understanding and acknowledging the existence of problem-solving ability and innovation within the community of stigmatized individuals. This is followed by partnering with the community members in identifying positive deviants and their successful strategies that can be used with ease within the community, and wider diffusion of those strategies. Researchers can help expedite this process of diffusion of innovation within the community. Further, researchers can play a very important role in the cross-diffusion of such successful strategies from one community to another, and subsequent participatory monitoring and evaluation of the process of social change. It is important for researchers and program managers to build an equitable alliance with the community members and support positive deviants as role models and leaders in the community. Further they can also play an important part in linking the community with other relevant stakeholders and advocacy partners to establish a united front to address both the normative and social structural level changes needed for stigma reduction in the society.This study also has certain limitations. While we uncovered how the process of self-strengthening and impact reiteratively reinforce each other, we could not determine the extent of the reiterations, specifically if such processes keep on building up throughout the whole life of the positive deviants or if they plateau at some point in life. Future studies should explore this further. Further, this study does not take into account the differences in the origin and severity of stigma across different health conditions, but rather focuses on the overall process of overcoming stigma. It is therefore important to take these unaccounted factors into consideration while formulating stigma reduction strategies based on the findings from this study. Despite the limitations, this study has several notable strengths. This study was able to identify 13 positive deviants through rigorous vetting. Marsh et al. (Marsh et al., 2004) have recommended a sample size of four to six participants in research involving the positive deviance approach owing to the rarity of positive deviants in the community. However, by partnering with the community stakeholders, we were able to identify and verify a much larger number of positive deviants than expected. To our knowledge, this was the first study to use the positive deviance approach to explore and understand how some individuals manage to overcome health-related stigma. Future studies should further expand on this approach by partnering with the community as an ally to design activities or interventions that can help other stigmatized individuals overcome stigma. Further, it is recommended that the positive deviant behavior and strategies identified in the study be utilized in stigma reduction interventions to assess its transferability, translationality, and effectiveness in non-positive deviants living with stigmatized health conditions.ConclusionThe positive deviance approach employed in this study to understand how positive deviants overcome stigma demonstrates the presence of problem-solving ability and agency within the community of stigmatized individuals in Indonesia. Positive deviance took shape in the form of psychological empowerment. The process of how positive deviance develops among people living with stigmatized health conditions and the successful behavior they employ to avert stigma in their lives may hold promise in helping others affected by stigmatized diseases in Indonesia in overcoming stigma and fostering social inclusion through the process of psychological empowerment. Positive deviants have been crucial in not only coming up with these unique solutions and strategies to avert stigma, but also diffusion of those through knowledge sharing and support to other stigmatized individuals. Further, they strive for social change by fostering awareness and relatedness, and changing the perception of the societies’ way of viewing people living with health conditions. Researchers can play an important role in this process by partnering with the community and helping expedite the process of diffusion of positive deviant strategies within and outside the communities.Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.FundingThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by Leprosy Research Initiative (LRI), 706.18.20.LRI; Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate (EMJD) Fellowship-Trans Global Health Consortium, 2013-0039.ORCID iDsSarju Sing Rai https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5914-1471Annisa Ika Putri https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4398-3567ReferencesAspinwall L.

On Sept. 18, 2013, Merco Press published an article about Colombia's refusal to trademark Escobar's name for instructive and recreational purposes; Escobar t-shirts have also become popular in the United States. (Raul Arboleda/AFP/Getty Images) By Epoch Times Staff9/18/2013Updated: 9/18/2013PrintNigeria: All Hats and No CattleNigerians and their penchant for big titles and empty displaysNigeria has sadly morphed into a nation where the type of treatment or amount of respect someone gets, from the populace, is related to whether the person has one or more titles attached to their names. ...There are some that feel unfulfilled if they have not acquired at least one title. They therefore give the pursuit and acquisition of a title an unbridled primacy in their quest for success in life. They are willing to get it at all costs – pay for it, bribe their way through, engage in corruption, make half-hearted donations to schools, churches or grease the palms of corrupt “royal fathers”. ...There is such thing as “high chiefs” in our midst. Someone joked that the concept of “high chiefs” began when some of the “chiefs” started feeling that some village royal fathers were cheapening the chieftaincy titles by conferring them on undeserving people. …Nigeria World Malaysia: ‘Stupid’ boy on his way to be a docBUTTERWORTH, Malaysia—He was only 13 when he went to work with a noodle seller here to help his family make ends meet.But the boy who was once called “stupid” never for a moment lost track of his ambition to be a doctor.Today, seven years after Chin Chi Sheuan started working at Tong Kok Hwa’s noodle stall at Chai Leng Park, he will be flying to Taiwan to enrol at the Chung Shan Medical Uni­versity to fulfil his long-cherished dream.However, it has not been smooth sailing for Chi Sheuan, who had to deal with the death of a beloved grandfather, a broken home, dividing time between his school and the stall, handling cranky customers and, above all, saving enough money to go to medical school.Tong, 41, felt his heart bleeding for the boy, whom he regarded as an adopted son.So, the noodle seller started his own fund-raising drive and every ringgit he collected from his customers on Sept 15 went towards making Chi Sheuan’s dream a reality. A customer who was touched by the boy’s plight paid RM18,000 for a bowl of noodle. And by the end of the day, the fund had swelled to RM30,000. ...The Star Columbia: Colombia denies registry of the ‘Escobar’ trademark to family membersColombia’s government has refused registration as a trademark of the full name “Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria” the country most notorious narcotics criminal. According to local news in Bogotá the application was filed by Maria Isabel Santos Cabalerro, Juana Manuela Marroquín Santos and Juan Sebastian Marroquín Santos, Escobar’s widow and children respectively who changed their names after settling in Argentina in the late 1990.The three had requested the international recognition of the trademark for the purposes of education, training and recreation.The Commission of Industry and Commerce refused to register a trademark which bears the name of ‘the most notorious drug lord in Colombia’s history’, adding it would be immoral and subvert public order’. It said the name Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria is associated with a dark period of violence in Colombia that claimed thousands of lives as he fought extradition to the United States.Merco Press Iran: ’Glitch' gave Iran social media accessSome Iranians thought a government ban had been lifted after they were able to access Twitter and Facebook on MondayIranians got direct access to Facebook and Twitter for the first time in four years because of a technical fault, an Iranian official has said, denying suggestions the government had lifted a ban on social media.On Monday evening, several Iranians said they gained access to their accounts without having to get round a government firewall, leading them to hope that authorities had relaxed a ban in place since anti-government protests in 2009, some of which were organised on social media. ...Al Jazeera Uzbekistan: Share your harvest with the khokim, or be an enemy of the stateAllamurat Ametov – a farmer from Karakalpakstan – refused to “donate” one ton of rice per hectare of his cultivated land to the regional khokim (administrator). He was sued and as a result his farm was taken away. The 28-year-old farmer from the Nukus region of Karakalpakstan, presently unemployed, says that he is very disappointed with the justice system in the country. “I have been filing complaints and petitions to all the levels of the justice system for the past four years – the attorney general, the national security services chair, the supreme court, the minister of justice, the prime minister … all to no avail,” says Mr. Ametov. UZ News Canada: Family outraged after Rehtaeh Parsons photo appears in dating ad on FacebookFacebook has apologized and banned a dating company from advertising on its website after an ad featured a photo of Rehtaeh Parsons, a Halifax teen who died in April after a suicide attempt.“This is an extremely unfortunate example of an advertiser scraping an image from the Internet and using it in their ad campaign,” Facebook said in a statement emailed to the Star. ...The ad featured a photo of Parsons with the caption: “Find Love in Canada! Meet Canadian girls and women for friendship, dating or relationships.” Ionechat.com could not immediately be reached for comment. ...Toronto StarA screenshot of the ad featuring Rehtaeh Parsons. UK: Senior police in ‘drunk tanks’ callPrivately-run “drunk tanks” should be considered to tackle alcohol-fuelled disorder, police chiefs have said.Under the idea, drunks who are a danger to themselves would be put in cells to sober up and then pay for their care.The Association of Chief Police Officers, which is launching a campaign on alcohol harm to coincide with university freshers’ season, said problem drinking was on the increase.The Police Federation said the plan was “neither a viable nor long-term” fix.Northamptonshire Chief Constable Adrian Lee, who leads on the issue of problem drinking for Acpo in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, told the BBC that police cells were not the best places for people who had got so drunk they were “incapable of looking after themselves”.Nor should the taxpayer have to pick up the bill for people’s drunkenness, he said. ...BBC Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowEpoch Times StaffAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesFani Willis’s Testy TestimonyFeb 16, 20242 Blockbuster Trump Hearings TodayFeb 15, 2024House Republicans Rejoice Over Mayorkas ImpeachmentFeb 14, 2024‘Never Trump’ Billionaires Back HaleyFeb 12, 2024Related TopicsCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

Methods: Several clinical pharmacists engaged in nutrition support therapy compiled a list of articles published in 2020 considered important to their clinical practice. The citation list was compiled into a single spreadsheet where the author participants were asked to assess whether the article was considered important to nutrition support pharmacy practice. A culled list of publications was then identified whereby at least 5 out of the 8 author participants considered the paper to be important. Guideline and consensus papers from professional organizations, important to practice but not ranked, were also included. Results: A total of 169 articles were identified; 5 from the primary literature were voted by the group to be of high importance. An additional 17 guidelines, position, recommendation, or consensus papers were also identified. The top-ranked articles from the primary literature were summarized and a narrative regarding its implications to pharmacy nutrition support practice were provided. Conclusion: We recommend that pharmacists engaged in nutrition support therapy be familiar with these articles as it pertains to their practice.Get full access to this articleView all access and purchase options for this article.Get AccessReferences1.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below. This will give you a glimpse into the world of astrology tailored for your baby.

Rashi and nakshatra, which are an integral part of Jyotisha, are believed to influence an individual’s personality and life events. The following sections give you rashi-related information, such as the associated letters, elements, ruling body, quality, and nakshatra for the name Mihira. These details help analyze a person’s characteristics, personality, and behavior.Zodiac Sign (Rashi)As shown in the following table, each rashi is associated with specific sounds, which are often used as the starting letters of names for newborns in Hindu families. Each rashi is represented by a figure and one of the five elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether (Space). One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Rashi (zodiac sign)Simha (Leo)Starting letters for Simha (Leo) rashiM, TTRepresentationLionElementFireRuling bodySunQualityFixedBirth Star (Nakshatra)Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth. There are 27 nakshatras, each with its own unique qualities, attributes, and symbolism. Each rashi contains two-and-one-fourth nakshatras in it.

She took the family dog to the home where St. Onge lived and saw the woman in her garage, waiving her hands for help.“I was so scared, but happy she was alive,” Dawn said.She went back and called 911 and sent her husband to cover the woman with a blanket before emergency service workers arrived on the scene.St. Onge’s daugher, Sandy Mitter, told a local paper that her mother slipped on Saturday night after she went out to eat dinner. She was not able to get up.“We think she laid there for two to two-and-a-half hours,” Mitter said. “She kept trying to yell for help and was banging on the wall for neighbors.”She described DiPietro as heroic. “Thank you so much,” she said. “You’re my hero.”“He saved her life, that’s for sure,” Mitter told the paper. “And I don’t even have the words to say how grateful we are.”DiPietro, who is in the fifth grade, said it’s “cool” to be considered a hero.

( Billie Weiss/Getty Images)By Jack Phillips9/24/2017Updated: 9/24/2017PrintA group of about 16 New England Patriots players knelt during the national anthem on Sunday, drawing a chorus of boos from the crowd.The Patriots were playing against the Houston Texans in Foxboro, Massachusetts.Tom Brady was notably standing during the anthem, interlocking arms with his teammates.Some fans reported that there were boos before and after the national anthem—a sign that they were directing their ire at the players.Meanwhile, almost the entire Pittsburgh Steelers team stayed in the locker room during the national anthem before their 1 p.m. ET kickoff against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field.“We’re not going to play politics,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said, as reported by ESPN. “We’re football players, we’re football coaches. We’re not participating in the anthem today—not to be disrespectful to the anthem, but to remove ourselves from the circumstance.”“People shouldn’t have to choose. If a guy wants to go about his normal business and participate in the anthem, he shouldn’t be forced to choose sides. If a guy feels the need to do something, he shouldn’t be separated from his teammate who chooses not to.”One player, Alejandro Villanueva, a veteran, stood for the national anthem outside the locker room tunnel.It comes after President Donald Trump slammed the NFL over the anthem protests, which were started last season by ex-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who said he did it as a protest against oppression toward people of color.“If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!” Trump tweeted Sunday morning. He added that “NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN.”“If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!” he also tweeted later on Saturday.

The fluorescein angiography showed no leakage, ruling out a diabetic macular edema. A treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab led to cystic changes resolution and visual acuity recovery.Conclusion:Intravitreal bevacizumab can be successfully employed for this complication of MIDD’s macular dystrophy.IntroductionMaternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) was first described in 19921,2 and represents only 0.5% to 2.8% of diabetic patients.3 MIDD is mainly caused by a point mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial DNA.2 A wide spectrum of disease manifestations has been described, as the mutation is responsible for both MIDD and MELAS syndromes (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes).The typical clinical constellation of MIDD consists of a maternally inherited deafness, an early adult-onset diabetes in the third or fourth decade and macular changes that simulate pattern dystrophy.3,4 Ophthalmologists should be aware of this condition as they can help other specialists to sharpen the diagnosis. The patient will benefit from a better management of his diabetes, as this kind exhibits a higher prevalence of kidney disease, requiring an early renal protection.5 Moreover, some medicaments commonly used in diabetic patients should be avoided: metformin worsens the risk of lactic acidosis and statins should be used with caution in patients with myopathy.4 MIDD patients can as well associate other comorbidities as cardiac conduction defects that need to be screened. Finally, all first-degree relatives should be screened for the mutation and counseled genetically.4 Hence the importance of a prompt and accurate diagnosis of this particular form of diabetes, where the ophthalmologist may play a major role.A lower incidence of diabetic retinopathy has been described in MIDD’s patients, compared to other common forms of diabetes.3,5 However, up to 86% of patients suffering from MIDD present retinal abnormalities described as a macular pattern dystrophy.3,6 According to De Laat et al.,7 this macular dystrophy is classified into four stages: in grade 1 fine pigment abnormalities are better detected with fundus autofluorescence or fluorescein angiography. Hence fundus autofluorescence can help the early detection and recognition of the macular dystrophy, as it shows a decreased autofluorescence in areas of atrophy and increased autofluorescence of the pale subretinal deposits, even in areas of the retina that appeared normal clinically.8 Grade 2 retinal dystrophy clearly shows pigmented deposits that tend to encircle the macula, and often the optic disc. Grade 3 disease is characterized by profound choriorretinal atrophy with foveal sparing. In grade 4, fovea is affected by atrophy.6,7Only two previous cases of macular cysts associated to MIDD’s maculopathy have been reported.7,9 The therapeutic approach of this uncommon or infra-diagnosed complication remains uncertain: topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment,7 topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, intravitreal triamcinolone and systemic immunosuppression have been employed.9Case descriptionA 49-year-old patient diagnosed with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) was cared for in our clinic for twenty years. The hyperpigmented perifoveal dots in both maculae, the late onset diabetes (diagnosed at age 29) and a neurosensory deafness since he was 20 years old, in association with a high penetrance of both diabetes and deafness in his maternal lineage (Figure 1) were reasons to suspect a maternally inherited diabetes and deafness. The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of mitochondrial DNA mutation 3243A>G in peripheral blood.Figure 1. Family pedigree showing the maternal inheritage of diabetes, hearing loss or retinal abnormalities. Note the index case is marked with an additional square.The patient attended regular follow-ups where a slow progression of his macular dystrophy was observed. The hyperpigmented perifoveal dots evolved to discontinuous, circumferentially oriented perifoveal atrophy. Finally the atrophy patches coalesced into a ring that spared the central fovea (Figure 2(a)). The presence of intrarretinal hemorrhages and some isolated hard exudates demonstrates a mild diabetic retinopathy, which was quiescent and required no treatment. Indeed, he had a poor metabolic control. Between 2001 and 2020 his HbA1c ranged from 8.2% to 12.6% despite being treated with insulin and committing to regular follow-ups with endocrinologists.Figure 2. (a) Coalescent chorioretinal atrophic patches can be observed circumferentially to the macula. The fovea is spared. The presence of intrarretinal hemorrhages demonstrates a mild diabetic retinopathy, (b) Fluorescein angiography of the right eye shows a window defect in the area of the atrophy, with areas of hyperfluorescence demarcating the RPE defects. No leakage is seen, and (c) Late phase of fluorescein angiography of the left eye.In a routine examination the patient complained from vision loss in his right eye. He had a visual acuity (VA) of 20/50 in his right eye and 20/25 in his left eye. At that moment his HbA1c value was 9.5%. On his right eye the OCT scan (Heidelberg Spectralis) revealed cystic macular changes and a retinal thickness of 452 µm (Figure 3(a)). Due to the exudative aspect of the cysts in the OCT scan and the presence of a mild diabetic retinopathy, we assumed it was a diabetic macular edema and we treated the cysts with an intravitreal loading dose of bevacizumab (three monthly injections). No fluorescein angiography was performed at that moment. At the next consultation, VA had improved to 20/20 in his right eye and the OCT showed an anatomical improvement with resolution of his intrarretinal cysts (Figure 3(b)).Figure 3. OCT scans (Heildeberg Spectralis): (a) cystic macular changes in the right eye (RE), left eye (LE) shows a normal foveal contour. (b) Resolution of the cysts in the RE after a loading dose of intravitreal bevacizumab, (c) recurrence of macular cysts on the RE, (d) resolution of the cysts after a single-dose of intravitreal bevacizumab, and (e) OCT scan at the last visit available showing a preserved foveal contour in both eyes. Some perifoveal outer retinal atrophy patches can be seen in all OCT scans.Four months later, he had a recurrence. The vision on his right eye dropped to 20/30 and the OCT revealed new intrarretinal cysts (Figure 3(c)). His HbA1c value was 9.7%. At that moment, we decided to perform a fluorescein angiography which showed no leakage, ruling out a diabetic macular edema (Figure 2(b) and (c)). Therefore, we suspected the presence of optically empty cystic spaces but, given the previously good response to anti-VEGF, we considered the use off-label of an anti-VEGF. The patient was properly informed, and he consented to the treatment. After a single-dose of intravitreal bevacizumab, his vision ameliorated to 20/25 and a resolution of the intrarretinal cysts was noticed in the OCT scan (Figure 3(d)).After 1 year follow-up, no new recurrence has been detected and his vision remains stable. At the last visit his visual acuity was 20/25 and the last OCT scan showed a preserved foveal contour (Figure 3(e)).DiscussionMaternally inherited diabetes and deafness is an uncommon entity. As ophthalmologist, we may observe pigmented dots that evolve to coalescent atrophic patches. Both photoreceptor outer segments and retinal pigment epithelium cells are involved in the pathogenesis of this retinal dystrophy.10However, few cases develop a cystoid macular edema.As far as we know, only two cases of macular cysts have been associated to MIDD maculopathy.7,9 De Laat et al. described a bilateral cystoid macular edema “without a clear underlying cause” in a 35-year-old MIDD patient that resolved after four-month of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment.7 Recently, Qian et al. reported a case of cystoid macular changes in a 30-year-old MIDD patient. In the fluorescein angiography cystic spaces did not show leakage, ruling out a possible macular edema. The cystic changes resolved after topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, oral prednisone and systemic immunosuppression. However, the cysts recurred when topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor was given as monotherapy, requiring the off-label use of an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide. The cysts remitted and haven’t recurred in the last 18 months.9 Both cases demonstrate the presence of optically empty cystic spaces in MIDD’s macular dystrophy.A lower incidence of diabetic retinopathy in maternally inherited diabetes and deafness has been described, and some authors even suggest that mitochondrial mutations may have a protective effect against diabetic retinopathy.3,5 However, in the current case, the patient showed a mild diabetic retinopathy and the cysts on the OCT scan had an exudative appearance. As any other diabetic patient, MIDD patients can develop diabetic macular edema. That’s why it is so important in these cases to perform a fluorescein angiography, which will help to distinguish diabetic macular edema from cystic macular changes.Nevertheless, the best treatment option for these cysts is still unclear. It is known that other retinal dystrophies may as well associate a cystic macular edema, as retinitis pigmentosa, enhanced S cone syndrome and X-linked retinoschisis. Its pathogenesis is still not well defined, and the first line treatment option in these patients is topical use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. It remains to be elucidated if it would be an adequate option in a MIDD’s maculopathy that develops cysts. Until now, the only case treated with topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors recurred when given in monotherapy and required the use of intravitreal triamcinolone.9The current case shows that cystic changes resolved after a pro re nata regimen of Bevacizumab, suggesting that VEGF may play a major role in the pathogenesis of these cysts. To our knowledge, this is the first case of MIDD’s macular dystrophy associated cystoid macular edema that has been successfully treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF. Probably, many cystoid macular changes in these patients remain undiagnosed, either because of a lack of diagnosis of this syndrome or due to a misdiagnosis as a regular diabetic macular edema. More cases need to be reported, which will allow further studies to take place, and will assess the clinical management of this uncommon complication.We would therefore like to emphasize the need of a correct identification of this syndrome. A high index of suspicion is needed: the maculopathy is very characteristic, almost pathognomonic in association with the typical clinical constellation,3 and it may help the ophthalmologist to diagnose this infrequent entity. These patients will benefit from a better management of his diabetes, an optimal treatment and the screening and prevention of other common complications as nephropathy and cardiac conduction defects. Moreover, genetic counsel can be offered to the patient’s relatives.ConclusionMaternally inherited diabetes and deafness often associates a macular dystrophy that may in some cases develop macular cysts. Fluorescein angiography allows the differential diagnosis between macular cysts and diabetic macular edema. Anti-VEGF therapy can be useful in the treatment of macular cysts associated to this dystrophy, as the current case shows. However, further investigations are needed in order to better understand its pathogenesis and the possible therapeutic approaches.Ethics approval and consent to participateThis study was approved by the institutional review board of La Ribera Hospital.Consent for treatmentThe patient consented to the treatment.Consent for publicationThe patient consented to participate and for publication.Declaration of conflicting interestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.FundingThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.ORCID iDsAmelia Marco-Campmany https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2396-0728Javier Navarrete-Sanchis https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4479-6341References1.

(AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo)By The Associated Press1/11/2016Updated: 1/11/2016PrintMEXICO CITY—Mexico began the process of extraditing drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman to the United States, two days after the famed fugitive was recaptured following a dramatic, months-long hunt featuring movies stars, sewer escapes and bloody shootouts.Officials warned that the process could take a long time as Guzman’s lawyers file legal appeals and maneuver to keep their client in Mexico, where he has already escaped from maximum security prisons twice.On Sunday, agents formally notified Guzman that he was wanted in the United States. In a statement, the Attorney General’s Office said Mexican agents assigned to the international police agency Interpol served two arrest warrants to the drug lord, who is being held at the Altiplano prison following his capture by Mexican marines on Friday.Guzman’s defense now has three days to present arguments against extradition and 20 days to present supporting evidence, beyond the plethora of other appeals they have already started filing.Guzman’s powerful Sinaloa cartel smuggles multi-ton shipments of cocaine and marijuana as well as manufacturing and transporting methamphetamines and heroin, mostly to the U.S. He is wanted in various U.S. states and his July escape deeply embarrassed the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto and strained ties between the countries.Guzman’s attorney Juan Pablo Badillo has said the defense has already filed six motions to challenge extradition requests.Badillo said that his client shouldn’t be extradited to the U.S. because “our country must respect national sovereignty, the sovereignty of its institutions to impart justice.”On Saturday, a Mexican federal law enforcement official said the quickest Guzman could be extradited would be six months, but even that is not likely because of the many appeals filed by his lawyers. He said that the appeals are usually turned down, but each one means a judge has to schedule a hearing.“That can take weeks or months, and that delays the extradition,” he said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. “We’ve had cases that take six years.”Mexico’s willingness to extradite Guzman is a sharp turnaround from the last time he was captured in 2014, when then-Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said the extradition would happen only after he finished his sentence in Mexico in “300 or 400 years.”Guzman was re-apprehended on Friday after a shootout between gunmen and Mexican marines at the home in Los Mochis, a seaside city in Guzman’s home state of Sinaloa. Five suspects were killed and six others arrested. One marine was injured.Mexican authorities say actor Sean Penn’s contacts with Guzman helped them track the fugitive down — even if he slipped away from an initial raid on the hideout where the Hollywood actor apparently met him.Penn’s article on Guzman was published late Saturday by Rolling Stone magazine, a day after the drug lord’s recapture. In it, Penn wrote of elaborate security precautions, but also said that as he flew to Mexico on Oct 2 for the meeting, “I see no spying eyes, but I assume they are there.”He was apparently right.A Mexican federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to comment on the issue, told the Associated Press the Penn interview led authorities to Guzman in the area of Tamazula, a rural part of Durango state.READ MORESean Penn’s Flattering Interview of ‘El Chapo’ Provokes MockeryDrug Lord ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán Located Thanks to Interview With Sean PennThey raided Guzman’s remote hideout a few days after the interview and narrowly missed capturing Guzman, whose July escape from Mexico’s top security prison — though a mile-long (1.5-kilometer) tunnel — had embarrassed President Enrique Pena Nieto and made his capture a national priority.Describing the capture, Attorney General Arely Gomez said that investigators had been aided in locating Guzman by documented contacts between his attorneys and “actors and producers” she said were interested in making a film about him, though she did not name them.Two months after that close call, marines finally caught him in a residential neighborhood of Los Mochis, where they'd been monitoring a suspected safe house. Guzman was able to escape via storm drains and exited a manhole in the street. But he was captured in a vehicle on the highway.In the interview in Rolling Stone, Guzman defends his work at the head of the world’s biggest drug trafficking organization, one blamed for thousands of killings. When asked if he is to blame for high addiction rates, he responds: “No, that is false, because the day I don’t exist, it’s not going to decrease in any way at all. Drug trafficking? That’s false.”READ MOREDrug Lord ‘El Chapo’ Captured, but Extradition Is Next ChallengePenn wrote that Guzman was interested in having a movie filmed on his life and wanted Mexican actress Kate del Castillo, who had portrayed a drug trafficker in a television series, involved in the project.“He was interested in seeing the story of his life told on film, but would entrust its telling only to Kate,” wrote Penn, who appears in a photo posted with the interview shaking hands with Guzman.Penn’s representatives have not commented on the claims by Mexican officials.

Sometimes, the mechanisms we develop to manage these feelings aren’t actually helpful to us and may cause strain in our relationships. Psychological projection is one example.It’s common, and you probably aren’t even aware you’re doing it. But if you learn how to recognize it in yourself and the people you’re close to, you can work to change your own behavior and protect yourself from it in others.What Is Psychological Projection?Psychological projection is a behavior known in psychology as a defense mechanism. It’s an unconscious way of coping with emotional conflict and discomfort, according to the American Psychological Association (APA).When someone engages in projection, they attribute their own behaviors, emotions, characteristics, or impulses to another person or group without realizing it. “Projection is when we take feelings that we might not want to acknowledge in ourselves, such as jealousy or anger, and we ‘project’ them onto someone else,” explains Kelsey M. Latimer, PhD, a clinical psychologist and registered nurse in Stuart, Florida.Projection doesn’t reflect anything that’s actually been said or done by whoever is on the receiving end. It’s about what the person doing the projecting is thinking and feeling about themselves. For example, someone worried about their job performance might become overly critical of a co-worker, explains Joel Frank, PsyD, a clinical psychologist and neuropsychologist based in Los Angeles. “In this case, projection is used to quell the person’s insecurities surrounding their performance by converting their worries into criticisms about others,” he says.Common Questions & AnswersWhat are examples of psychological projection?One example is feeling intense anger toward someone and, instead of discussing or expressing that anger, saying, “They hate me.” Another is cheating on a monogamous romantic partner while constantly accusing them of being a cheater.Is projection gaslighting?Being accused of something you didn’t do or of having feelings you don’t can feel like gaslighting. But projection is something people do without realizing it to protect themselves from bad feelings. According to the APA, gaslighting is a form of manipulation where one person causes another to doubt themselves or their reality to gain control.How can you tell if someone is projecting?It can be challenging to spot projecting, but there are signs, including being defensive, making unfounded accusations, and being overly critical. If someone is placing blame or accusations without proof and being very defensive when questioned about their behavior, they could be projecting.How do I know if I’m projecting?Most people don’t know when they’re projecting, but it is possible to become more aware of your behaviors. If you find yourself having a strong negative reaction to someone else, consider whether you recognize something you don’t like about yourself in them. You may want to explore these feelings in therapy.How do you fix psychological projection?You can stop yourself from engaging in projection by being open to exploring feelings and receiving feedback in a safe setting, usually in group or individual therapy. It can take time to recognize your behavior and learn new ways to cope.What Causes Psychological Projection?Projection arises as a way to manage uncomfortable emotions, thoughts, or impulses. People might use projection to avoid acknowledging them, or to process them from a safe distance.Dr. Latimer says it can happen when someone “sees parts of themselves in others that they cannot stand in themselves.”Projection is often tied to feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem, according to Dr. Frank. He explains that internal distress can overwhelm a person’s ability to cope, so they displace their discomfort onto others.What Are the Signs Someone Is Projecting onto YouThe signs of projection can look different coming from different people, according to Frank. But he says there are some common traits.Being Overly CriticalWhen someone is quick to point out other people’s flaws and shortcomings, it may be an attempt to quiet their own insecurities. Frank explains that someone’s worries about their own character or behavior can be converted into criticism of others.Making AccusationsHas someone accused you of something that seemed to come completely out of left field? It could actually be something they’ve done or thought about doing. Think about a cheating spouse who acts suspicious of their partner.DefensivenessPeople who engage in projection often don’t know they’re doing it. Mental health experts say they may deny their feelings or behavior if you confront them. They may question your motives and refuse to take responsibility for their role in the situation.How Projection Affects Your Health“Projection is one of many defense mechanisms that all healthy people will engage in every once in a while,” says Latimer. However, if someone uses it a lot, “It is likely going to lead to some rocky relationships,” she says.Projection can also be a sign of certain mental health issues. Research has linked projection and other defense mechanisms to depression and anxiety, and to borderline, narcissistic, and antisocial personality traits.“At times, with strong projection, we can feel or actually be out of touch with reality and genuine connection with ourselves and others,” says Leslie Dobson, PsyD, a clinical and forensic psychologist in Long Beach, California.How to Stop Projecting — and What to Do if Someone Is Projecting onto YouIf you’re the one engaging in projection, it is possible to stop, but you’ll need to be aware of your behavior first. This can come through therapy and by accepting feedback. “As people progress through therapy and more individuals point out when and how they use projection, they become more aware of the defense and can more quickly identify when using it,” says Frank.Think about your emotions and feelings towards others in different situations. When someone triggers a negative emotion in you, reflect instead of reacting. Is it really about them, or is something deeper going on inside you? Working with a therapist can help you learn different ways of coping.If you’re on the receiving end of projection, Frank suggests you remember that the criticism or accusation isn’t about you. Try engaging the other person in an open, honest conversation about the situation and your feelings.Dr. Dobson recommends confronting the projection directly. Say: “I believe you are saying this or feeling this, but it is not related to me. You may want to reflect on the strength of your emotions at this time and take some space.""It’s important that you not accept or internalize what the person doing the projecting is saying about you, says Latimer. Communication and setting boundaries can help protect you and the relationship.Resources We Trust: ProjectionIf being on the receiving end of projection is causing you distress, there are organizations and tools that can help.Favorite Groups for Awareness and SupportNational Domestic Violence HotlineThe National Domestic Violence Hotline provides access to support and tools for domestic violence survivors 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

(Supplied by Genkyo Team)By Alex Wu3/16/2022Updated: 3/16/2022PrintX 10:00With the Russia-Ukraine war still ongoing, volunteers from more than 52 countries have joined the Ukrainian international legion.A well-known Chinese writer and a critic of China’s ruling Chinese Communist Party told the Chinese language edition of The Epoch Times that he had applied to join the legion on March 10 and was leaving for Kyiv on March 14.Yi Qiwei shared his experience from volunteering in the Polish town of Medyka at the Ukrainian border while waiting to leave to Kyiv to join the fight.Yi Qiwei (a.k.a. Wu Dizhao), a descendant of a Manchu royal bannerman, published his first novel “Redemption” at the age of 14 in 2011. At the time, mainland Chinese media called him “China’s most talented young writer.” He claimed that his maternal grandfather was a high ranking Chinese communist official whose name he’s reluctant to publicize. In recent years, Yi has become a vocal critic of the communist regime. He usually resides in Japan.Yi and his group of nine friends were traveling from the Netherlands to Germany on March 7 when they decided to buy some supplies, clothes, and food to drive them to Medyka and volunteer.Yi said that after arriving at the border to help the refugees, he felt the reality was very different from what he imagined. It was really hard to be a volunteer.He witnessed a lot of refugees coming from Ukraine, all who had a look of desperation on their faces. “You could see that those people were very helpless. There was no place for the children to sleep, it was super cold,” he said.“They had no food at all and they were very helpless. Most of them can’t speak English or Polish. Many children are the same age as my daughter, which makes me sad. We provide them with food and water as much as possible.”Yi said he also provided some financial help to some Ukrainian refugees he met, as their Ukrainian currency and cards were not accepted in Poland.He said: “We also hope that more people will see and help them. We want to let these refugees see that there are so many people coming to help them to give them hope.”Ukrainian refugees in the Polish border town of Medyka in March 2022. (Supplied by Genkyo Team)Yi said he saw many Ukrainian refugees sleeping in train stations, McDonald’s, and other public places after crossing the Polish border. He helped some refugees stay in hotels.Yi criticized the Chinese regime’s propaganda and its support of Russia’s war, which he said is claiming that “national interests are above everything else.”He said that what the common people want is a good life, and a nation should protect its people—not the other way around.“If this happened to them, they would not say such things,” Yi said of the Chinese who echo the regime’s talking points.“There is no so-called ‘national interest.’ What the people want is very simple—to live in peace and stability. The people can only develop the country’s economy if they are alive. If you talk about those slogans with disregard of people’s lives, who would still follow you?”Zhao Fenghua and Gu Xiaohua contributed to the report.

We do not accept as the military slave,'' in Kamayut township of Yangon, Burma, on April 19, 2021. (AP Photo)By The Associated Press4/20/2021Updated: 4/20/2021PrintBANGKOK—The European Union expanded its sanctions against Burma’s military leaders and army-controlled companies ahead of a regional meeting to discuss the worsening crisis after army leaders deposed the elected government.The Council of the European Union’s latest sanctions target 10 individuals and two military-controlled companies already subject to sanctions by the United States, Britain, and other governments.It is unclear if such moves are having any impact as the military escalates its efforts to crush opposition to its seizure of power. Burma’s economy is already in crisis, worsened by the coronavirus pandemic and by the mass civil disobedience movement that arose following the Feb. 1 coup.The EU said the number of individuals sanctioned was expanded to 35 people it said were responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law, for repressive decisions, and for serious human rights violations.The two military-controlled companies, Myanmar Economic Holdings Public Company Ltd. (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corp. (MEC), have vast holdings in many industries and help to fund the military.All are subject to having their assets frozen, travel banned, and other measures. EU citizens and businesses are banned from doing business or providing funds to them without special permission.“Today’s decision is a sign of the EU’s unity and determination in condemning the brutal actions of the military junta, and aims at effecting change in the junta’s leadership,” the EU said in a statement.“Today’s decision also sends a clear message to the military leadership: continuing on the current path will only bring further suffering and will never grant any legitimacy,” it said.An anti-coup protester throws a smoke bomb against police during a crackdown in Thaketa township in Yangon, Burma, on March 27, 2021. (AP Photo)Since the coup, security forces have killed at least 738 protesters and bystanders, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests. It says more than 3,200 people are still detained, among the nation’s deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint.The EU already had an embargo on sales to Burma of arms and equipment that can be used for internal repression; an export ban on dual-use goods for use by the military and border guard police; export restrictions on equipment for monitoring communications that could be used for internal repression; and a prohibition on military training for and military cooperation with the army.Last week, the U.S. S&P 500 said it was removing India’s Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. from its sustainability index due to its alleged dealings with Burma authorities. Adani did not respond to a request for comment on that move.Former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday exhorted the U.N. Security Council to act immediately to halt the violence and protect civilians. So far, the council has not taken such action, which would likely be blocked by China and Russia.The Association of Southeast Asian Nations—which is holding a summit on Burma this month—maintains a policy of “non-interference” in each others’ political matters and has rejected the idea of imposing sanctions against the junta.Ban urged ASEAN to send a high-level delegation to Burma. He said he had tried unsuccessfully to make a diplomatic visit himself.By Elaine Kurtenbach Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowThe Associated PressAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesWorld Shares Follow Wall Street Higher as Japan’s Nikkei Nears Record HighFeb 16, 2024Lyme Disease Case Counts in the US Rose by Almost 70 Percent in 2022 Due to a Change in How It’s ReportedFeb 15, 2024Power Outages Hit Boston Transit System During Morning Rush Hour, Stranding ThousandsFeb 15, 20242 Chinese Fishermen Drown After Chase With Taiwan’s Coast Guard, Which Alleges TrespassingFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsBurmasanctionsThe European UnionCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

(Courtesy of CountryWide Homes)By Neil Sharma1/18/2016Updated: 1/29/2016PrintWhen you sell the fourth-most homes in the Greater Toronto Area, there’s nary a doubt you’re experienced, esteemed, and elite. After a diligent decade of dazzling design, CountryWide Homes hit a few milestones in 2015, including a new total sales record. CountryWide is bolstered by a stable of veteran executives—some of whom have over 50 years of experience in the industry—who have helped the decade-old company establish unique design hallmarks. “The first 10 years was entry-level, we were new to this game,” Richard Mariani, sales & marketing manager of CountryWide Homes, told the Epoch Times in an interview. “Now we’ve officially established ourselves as a homebuilder, and now we’re going to the next level of calibre. The Mercedes-AMG series is what we like to compare ourselves to. We also have a new design studio we’re going to be building out this year with even higher levels of finishes.” The focus of the new addition of approx 3,000 sq-ft will be luxury design, nestled next to CountryWide’s other 6,000 square-foot studio in the rear of its Concord, Ontario, headquarters. The studios are staffed with qualified interior design consultants to help CountryWide homebuyers personalize finishes and upgrades. CountryWide’s brain trust had the prescience to buy fringe land surrounding the GTA years ago because there were emerging signs that land would become extremely scarce and its costs would consequently surge. It’s one of the reasons CountryWide hasn’t been hampered by the GTA’s housing shortage. Mariani said that because the region is growing at an unprecedented rate, everything, including subways, are now routing northerly. As the need for density grows, high-rises won’t be isolated to Toronto’s core.“We know the way this city is building and expanding. Townhouses may not be the affordable entry-level option in the GTA anymore; it could be the condo option,” he said. “No builder out there looks at what they’re going to sell for just the next year—they’re looking at the next five years, 10 years, down the road. We’re always trying to forecast what’s coming down the pipe.” CountryWide had 18 active sites in 2015, and seven sold out. The company sold 650 homes last year, effortlessly smashing its previous record of 575. However, Mariani partly attributes the good fortune to Toronto’s searing market. While CountryWide doesn’t expect to take a step back in 2016, it forecasts a slower sales year. “We certainly can’t predict the 2016 housing market, but I can say on behalf of our company that we'll anticipate a bit of a slowdown,” he said. “(Last year) was not realistic; it was a hot, hot market. We’re cautious with what we’re releasing and to whom. There are a lot of factors and variables we don’t necessarily know about, like the Canadian dollar (at a 13-year low). It may hurt the local buyer but could help the foreign buyer. We’re here to sell top-quality houses, and a lot of Chinese investors coming here love our product.” He added that CountryWide has 11 sites carrying over into this year, with about six new sites slated to launch sales, give or take a few. Impressively, and as a testament to its vision, CountryWide Homes is one of three builders—the other two are Aspen Ridge Homes and Lakeview Homes—developing a brand new town north of Newmarket called Queensville. In addition to 6,000 inaugural lots, there will be nine schools, a community centre and library, parks, trails, retail, and dining options. The first phase launched last year with 36- and 45-ft lots and townhomes. The second phase will be released in the spring/summer of this year. However, closer to home, CountryWide is developing in-demand projects, for which the Chinese community is particularly keen. The 531-lot Observatory Hill—eponymously named after the historic Richmond Hill district—is a much-anticipated mix of lots ranging between 30 and 50 feet, and will also include semi-detached houses and townhouses. Mariani said the Chinese community has expressed the most interest in Observatory Hill, and many are anxiously awaiting its late spring launch. “People are telling us they’re planning their vacations around our opening because they don’t want to miss it,” he said. “It’s another milestone for CountryWide, and I would assume the other three builders building at Observatory Hill, because this piece of land is the only piece left on Bayview. It’s important for us to make a statement there with quality design so that for years down the line people can say ‘I’m proud I bought at Observatory Hill.’” Another project coveted by many in the Chinese community is an as-yet unnamed project located at Bayview and Steeles Ave. in North York, slated to be built on the site of the former Tyndale University College & Seminary. The surrounding milieu will incorporate much greenery, and lots will be built as wide as 60 feet. “This is in North York. There’s not usually any new development there,” said Mariani. “It’s usually in-fill—someone knocks down a house and builds a one-off. We’re doing this through one-on-one private appointments. I'd compare it to buying a full floor at Toronto’s Four Seasons Private Residences.” The luxury houses will cost over $3 million and will be designed by the renowned Stephen Hunt of Hunt Design Associates. When it comes to Chinese buyers, Mariani says they’re particularly fastidious about amenities like schools, and as a result, CountryWide pays careful attention to where it builds. “At all of our sites’ sales centres, we have amenities maps that highlight all schooling in the areas, from elementary schools through high schools and colleges,” he said. “Now it’s about finding the best schools to build around. We carefully collected sites around good schools. We forecast the land we’re buying around the city.” Neil Sharma is a Toronto-based freelance journalist.

Here are a few nicknames you can begin with for the name Rishika.RishiShikaNikaRishKariRishika’s Zodiac Sign As Per Western AstrologyWestern astrology includes the construction of a horoscope based on the person’s exact time of birth and location to understand the positions of the planet, stars, and zodiac signs at that time. However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

The main outcomes were intraocular pressure (IOP), the number of glaucoma medications, postoperative maneuvers like BN, and subsequent SBR. Success was defined as IOP ⩽ 18 and 20% reduction (criterion A), ⩽15 and 25% reduction (criterion B), and ⩽12 mmHg and 30% reduction (criterion C) reached with (qualified) or without (complete) medications at the last visit. Complete failure was defined as additional glaucoma surgery, loss of light perception, or sight-threatening complications. Multivariable Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates tests were performed.Results:Fifty-eight eyes with either stand-alone or combined Phaco-XEN surgery were included. Complete success by the different definitions was 50.0% (95% confidence interval, 5.8%–84.5%) (A), 50.0% (5.8%–84.5%) (B), and 25% (0.9%–66.5%) (C) whereas qualified success was 38.3% (1.6%–80.1%), 31.7% (2.0%–71.4%), and 0%, respectively, at the 24-months visit. 30% of cases underwent BN with 5-Fluorouracil, and SBR was performed in 17.5% of eyes. Low IOP levels at 1-month and early BN were significantly associated with success. The highest chance of failure was achieved in the combined Phaco-XEN group undergoing SBR.Conclusions:In our real-life setting, the first month IOP was associated with greater success rates. Although BN obtained improved IOP values, SBR was associated with a greater bleb survival in the stand-alone XEN group. Both BN and SBR had poor outcomes in the combined Phaco-XEN group.IntroductionGlaucoma is the leading cause of global irreversible blindness, and it is expected to increase with the aging of the population, achieving an estimated prevalence of 111.8 million people in 2040.1 To date, intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable risk factor to reduce progression, either with first-line antihypertensive topical treatment or more invasive filtering or drainage device surgical procedures. During the last decade, new, less aggressive surgical techniques have changed this scenario. The XEN45 Gel Stent (Allergan, Dublin, Ireland) consists of a 45 µm lumen, 6-mm long porcine preloaded gel stent that creates a controlled outflow of the aqueous humor into the subconjunctival space, forming a subconjunctival reservoir. As in any bleb-forming technique, this filtering bleb needs specific postoperative management, occasionally requiring bleb needling (BN) and/or surgical bleb revision (SBR) to enhance its functionality. The present study aimed to analyze the real-life outcomes of the XEN stent in our tertiary hospital considering all the required postoperative care of this procedure – thus taking BN and SBR procedures into account- and to evaluate accordingly the predictive factors for success and failure.Material and methodsStudy designAll patients who underwent mitomycin-augmented XEN45 Gel Stent surgery with or without phacoemulsification at the glaucoma Department, Hospital Clínic, between June 2016 and May 2019 were included in this retrospective study. This work adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our institution. All patients signed informed written consent before surgery.In the preoperative visit, all patients had a complete ophthalmologic examination including IOP measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry, visual acuity in decimal scale (Snellen Chart), slit-lamp examination, gonioscopy, optic nerve evaluation, and Humphrey visual field testing (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, CA). Surgery was indicated in cases of uncontrolled glaucoma with IOP above target or intolerance to hypotensive medical treatment and it was performed by two experienced glaucoma surgeons (EM and MP). To ensure high generalizability, no exclusion criteria in terms of the type of glaucoma or previous glaucoma procedures were used. Patients had to have at least 6 months of follow-up postoperative data to be incorporated in the analysis. Data of both eyes of the same patient were included if they met the inclusion criteria.Surgical techniqueThe ab-interno surgical technique of the XEN45 implantation is described elsewhere.2 In all cases, 0.1 ml of mitomycin C (MMC) at 0.1 mg/ml was injected before implantation and subconjunctival stent placement was aimed with final verification of its free mobility at the end of the procedure. In those patients who underwent combined Phaco-XEN surgery, cataract extraction and in-the-bag intraocular lens placement were performed before XEN implantation.Postoperative careIn all eyes, glaucoma medications were discontinued on the day of surgery. Postoperatively, topical ofloxacin and dexamethasone drops were administered during the first week; afterwards, dexamethasone eyedrops were tapered for the following 3 months. Considering this is a retrospective study, the criteria to perform BN was not set in advance; however, the following general principles were followed: BN was indicated in all patients who did not present sufficient IOP reduction, or when prompt signs of failure were present, such as bleb encapsulation, lack of response to digital massage, or marked hyperemia or corkscrew vessels beyond the 1-month postoperative visit. BN was carried out either at the slit lamp or in the operating room according to each surgeon’s preference. Under topical lidocaine and diluted povidone-iodine, careful subconjunctival dissection above and below the stent with a 30-gauge bevel-up needle starting as posteriorly as possible, and a 0.1 ml 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) injection were performed.Surgical bleb revision (SBR) was indicated in those eyes with prior unsuccessful needling; but also, in those with insufficient IOP reduction that presented a markedly flat filtering bleb without visualization of the stent under the conjunctiva at the slit-lamp examination that could preclude from performing a correct BN technique (to avoid unnoticed damage of the stent). All SBR procedures were performed in the operating room. A fornix-based conjunctival flap was fashioned; after blunt dissection and removal of the fibrous tissue, XEN45 permeability was checked either with direct visualization or with trypan blue dye injection in the anterior chamber. Subconjunctival injection or sponge-applied 0.1 ml of MMC (0.01%) was also administered. Finally, the conjunctival wound was closed with interrupted 10-0 Nylon sutures.Outcome measuresPreoperative data within 2 months before surgery, and postoperative records at day 1, week 1, and 1, 3, and 6 months, and every 6 months until the 24-month visit were included in the analysis. The definition of success and failure followed previously reported recommendations for surgical trials.3 Complete failure was defined as loss of light perception, or sight-threatening complications, or the need for further glaucoma surgery, irrespective of IOP. If a new glaucoma procedure was recommended but it was declined by the patient, this was also considered a failure. Surgical success was defined and stratified by three levels of IOP reduction: IOP < 18 mmHg and 20% reduction (criterion A); IOP < 15 mmHg and 25% reduction (criterion B); and IOP < 12 mmHg and 30% reduction (criterion C); and further characterized as a complete or qualified success if the mentioned criteria were achieved without and with antihypertensive medications. The surgical success was analyzed for both the BN and SBR groups.The primary outcomes were IOP and the number of medications over time, the success and failure outcomes considering BN and SBR, and the analysis of predictive factors for success.Statistical analysisThe Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the sample distribution. Independent and dependent sample t-tests, when possible, were used to compare the outcomes between groups. Generalized estimated equations (GEE) were used to adjust for potential correlations between both eyes from the same individual. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and survival comparison considering failure and the three success criteria were performed using the Breslow (generalized Wilcoxon) test after clustering the cases from the same patients. A univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors for surgical failure and tonometric success. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Then, a multivariable Cox model was built. Criteria for model selection were guided by the univariate analysis and clinical significance of the variables. Again, as both eyes of the same patient could be included, correlations were considered with a shared frailty adjustment. For continuous variables described in prior reports as predictive factors for success (i.e. 1-week and 1-month IOP values), the possible influence of multicollinearity was assessed using variance inflation factor analysis. For all tests, statistical significance was set at two-tailed p < 0.05. Data analysis was performed with Stata v14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).ResultsParticipantsA total of 58 eyes of 51 patients were included in the study. 57.6% were female. The mean preoperative age was 73.7 ± 10.2 years (range 45–89). The rest of the baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1.Table 1.

During follow-up, data of 38 eyes (65.5%) were available at the 1-year visit, and only 10 eyes (17.2%) completed the 24-month visit. Both IOP and the number of medications were significantly reduced at each post-operative visit (Supplemental Table S1). The comparison between stand-alone versus combined phaco-XEN surgery using GEE showed that stand-alone surgery achieved a higher IOP reduction compared to the combined Phaco-XEN procedure at 1-day, 1-week, and 1-month time points (p < 0.01, Wald chi-squared). The number of antihypertensive medications also differed: those patients that had undergone stand-alone surgery used fewer medications on day 1 (p < 0.01) and 1-week (p < 0.05). During follow-up, the eyes in the stand-alone group experienced greater IOP and glaucoma medication reduction compared to combined Phaco-XEN only at the 1 day, and 1-week postoperative visits; however, these differences were no longer statistically significant from the 1-month time point.Figure 1. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and the number of glaucoma medications changes during the follow-up. Bars represent the standard deviation, respectively.Pre-op: baseline IOP; d: day; w: week; m: month.Survival analysisFigure 2(a) represents the survival analysis for complete failure. During follow-up, six cases were classified as a complete failure. Of those, one case had a bleb infection and five required a subsequent glaucoma surgery (two trabeculectomies, one ExPRESS mini-shunt implant, one Ahmed valve, and one XEN extraction after complete displacement into the anterior chamber). No other sight-threatening complications or loss of light perception were recorded. Cumulative percentages (95% CI) for complete failure were 0.0%, 7.8% (2.9%–22.8%), 14.2% (5.0%–36.9%), and 14.2% (5.0%–36.9%) for 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. Considering criterion A definition (Figure 2(b)), qualified and complete success rates were, respectively, 84.3% (68.1%–92.7%) and 100% at 12 months and 38.3% (1.6%–80.1%) and 50.0% (5.8%–84.5%) at 24 months; according to criterion B (Figure 2(c)), qualified and complete success rates were 63.4% (46.6%–76.3%) and 50.0% (5.8%–84.5%) at 12 months and 31.7% (2.0%–71.4%) and 50.0% (5.8%–84.5%) at 24 months, respectively; and for criterion C, (Figure 2(d)), qualified and complete success rates were, respectively, 34.7% (20.4%–49.4%) and 50.0% (5.8%–84.5%) at 12 months, and 0% and 25.0% (0.9%–66.5%) at 24 months (Supplemental Table S3).Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for cumulative complete failure (a) and for qualified (gray dashed line) and complete (black solid line) success following the <18 mmHg (b), <15 mmHg (c), and 12 mmHg (d) tonometric thresholds.Predictive factors for failure and successTable 2 summarizes the multivariable Cox regression analysis for the predictive factors for failure (a) and success (b) following criterion A. In the failure analysis, pre and postoperative IOP at the 1-day and 1-week visits were significantly correlated with failure. After surgery, using the B and C success cut-offs (Supplemental Table S3), IOP at the first-month visit was significantly correlated to increased risk of failure. In our success predictive model, day 1, day 7, and 1-month IOP showed no collinearity (mean-variance inflation factor = 1.17).Table 2.

Bold figures represent statistical significance.Bleb needlingBN was performed in 15 cases during the first postoperative year, and 3 of them were lost to follow-up. At the 12-month visit, 12 eyes (30%) received a first BN with 5-FU (time in months, median (interquartile range) = 2 (1–2). Three (7.5%) of the 12 cases received a second BN (2.5 (2–3) months). The incidence rate of BN was 1.1 needling/year in the stand-alone XEN group and 0.9 needling/year in the combined phaco-XEN group (p > 0.05) (Supplemental Figure S1). Table 2 and Supplemental Table S4 show the effect of bleb needling in the multivariable Cox regression model for the three success criteria. BN was not relevant to the model when following criterion A; however, for the 15 and 12 mmHg thresholds, it was associated with a higher survival (only statistically significant in the case of criterion B). To determine any correlation between the type of surgery and BN, a separate Cox regression analysis was performed (Supplemental Table S3 and Figure S3). In both stand-alone and combined Phaco-XEN surgeries, BN was not associated with an increased success rate when using the <18 mmHg cutoff (Figure 3(a)).Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for cumulative qualified success following the criterion A definition, when stratified by the type of surgery (black and gray solid lines, XEN surgery; dashed lines, combined Phaco-XEN surgery) and the type of postoperative intervention ((a), bleb needling; (b), surgical bleb revision).SBR: surgical bleb revision; w/: with; w/o: without.Surgical bleb revisionDuring the first year, SBR was performed in seven (17.5%) eyes. The incidence rate of SBR was 0.4 SBR/year in the stand-alone XEN group versus 0.8 SBR/year in the combined group (p > 0.05, Breslow test) (Supplemental Figure S1).Table 2 and Supplemental Table S4 show the effect of SBR in the multivariable Cox regression model for the three success criteria. In the three success definitions, SBR was associated with failure, although without statistically significant differences. Only XEN-alone surgery benefited from SBR; nonetheless, the HR presented (either a low risk of failure in XEN with SBR or high risk of failure in combined Phaco-XEN plus SBR) were not statistically significant (Figure 3(b)).Postoperative complicationsPostoperative complications are summarized in Table 3. Two patients passed away, both cases unrelated to the XEN procedure. Hypotony (IOP < 5 mmHg) was diagnosed in 18 eyes in the first postoperative week, but only three cases presented a flat anterior chamber. Choroidal detachments were found in five cases. All of them resolved uneventfully. The intracameral end of the stent was obstructed by the iris in four eyes and by a vitreous wick in one eye (exfoliation syndrome). Three cases were resolved after the YAG laser, and one case required an Argon iridoplasty for iris release. Finally, in one case, IOL luxation into the vitreous cavity and posterior scleral fixation of the IOL was performed.Table 3.

The present study shows the performance of XEN45 in a real-life setting including both BN and SBR outcomes.Overall, we found a comparable IOP and antihypertensive medication burden reduction at 12 months to that described in other retrospective studies (26.4%–30.5%).9,10 However, a recent paper performed in a similar population reported a slightly smaller IOP reduction of 24.5%, possibly due to their lower preoperative IOP values compared to the ones observed in our study (18.3 vs 23.5 mmHg, respectively).11Although there is still a lack of randomized, controlled clinical trials comparing XEN to other bleb-dependent surgeries, recent efforts have been made to elucidate the main failure and success predictors. One of the most studied factors is the influence of the combination of phacoemulsification, although its association to failure is still unclear. While Mansouri et al.12 found a higher proportion of patients in the success group with the stand-alone XEN surgery, Hohberger et al.13 reported lower IOP values with the combined Phaco-XEN procedure. Recent work with the longest follow-up time published so far14 showed that despite logistic regression analysis suggested no correlation with the type of surgery, Kaplan-Meier curves found higher success rates in the stand-alone group. In our study, although the XEN stand-alone had a greater IOP reduction, this difference was not statistically significant.Early postoperative IOP values have also been evaluated as potential predictors for failure and success. Previous publications have reported that an elevated first 24 h IOP measurement could be significantly associated with failure15 and greater needling rates.16 However, other factors like stent positioning, transient reduced aqueous humor production, and remaining ocular viscoelastic also determine this first day IOP assessment and therefore need to be taken into account.15 Moreover, modifications in the bleb morphology have been described up to the first postoperative month which could result in better IOP outcomes at a later stage.17 In this regard, Fea et al.18 have suggested using 1 month postoperative IOP determinations as a predictor of success, finding that a difference of <6 mmHg between week-1 and month-1 intraocular pressure measurements was associated with a final IOP of <16 mmHg. Similarly, in our cohort, higher IOP values at 1 month were correlated with a greater probability of failure in the regression model for both criterion B and C.As in any bleb-forming procedure,19–21 postoperative management may be required to optimize its function. In line with our BN rate of 30%, recent publications have reported approximately 30%–40% postoperative needling rates in both retrospective9,10 and prospective12,22 studies but it can be as high as 62% of BN when more than one needling is performed in the same eye.23 These differences may be due to the lack of consensus among studies in the indications and the number of bleb BN required.24 Interestingly, we found that, although BN was a reasonable postoperative maneuver in the stand-alone XEN group to obtain better IOP values (predictor of better outcomes for definitions B and C), it was not able to significantly increase bleb survival in the combined Phaco-XEN group.If BN is not successful, a potential alternative is an open SBR. This approach has been useful to restore aqueous outflow in cases of marked scarring or when the XEN implant is not visible enough to ensure a good needling technique.25 Although SBR after XEN45 has not been widely evaluated, several studies have shown rates between 9.2%7 and 34%.26 In our study, 17.5% of cases underwent major SBR. Overall, SBR was correlated with an increased risk of failure, and when further stratified with the type of surgery, K-M survival estimates showed that SBR did not increase success probability in the combined Phaco-XEN group. In previous studies, SBR has shown percentages of success as high as 90% with better results in stand-alone surgeries in pseudophakic eyes.26 We hypothesize that phacoemulsification-derived particles may enhance bleb inflammation and scarring, as described in other filtering procedures.27 Additionally, intraluminal organic material obstructing glaucoma implants has been found in combined Phaco-Express P50 procedures in which SBR was unsuccessful.26 Anterior segment optical coherence tomography has illustrated similar intraluminal obstruction in cases with prior combined phaco-XEN surgery and signs of a flat, nonfunctional bleb.27 Further studies including systematic anterior segment bleb and stent imaging are needed to validate these hypotheses.Regarding postoperative complications, the overall number in this audit may be slightly lower7,9,25,28 compared to other publications due to two reasons: first, postoperative BN was not considered as a complication but as part of postoperative care; and second, to ensure clinical applicability of our study, IOP < 6 mmHg without structural or functional changes was not taken into account as a complication by itself and hypotony was only recorded if flat anterior chamber, macular folds, or choroidal detachments were also present.29Our study has several limitations. First, due to the retrospective design of the study, a potential selection bias may be considered when analyzing these real-life results. Second, various patients of the study missed some of their appointments, and others were lost to follow-up which could have underpowered our analysis. Third, the incorporation of a myriad of different glaucoma included certain subtypes, such as PEX and/or uveitic glaucoma, which may have been more prone to failure, thus undermining our results. Fourth, due to the relatively small sample size, the survival estimates (as shown by the wide CI intervals) may have been biased, as also occurred with the detection of significant IOP reductions and predicting factors.ConclusionIn this real-life study, the XEN gel implant achieved a significant IOP and glaucoma medication burden reduction. The most important predictive factor of success was lower IOP values 1 month after surgery. BN was able to obtain greater IOP reductions in the stand-alone group, but it did not increase the overall bleb survival. SBR had better outcomes in the stand-alone group and showed poor results in the combined Phaco-XEN group, suggesting that a subsequent glaucoma surgery may be a better alternative in these cases. The evaluation of predictive factors of success and failure provides a more tailored approach, finding those cases that need closer follow-up and earlier postoperative interventions.AcknowledgmentsPresented in part as an oral communication at the Spanish Glaucoma Society Congress Virtual Meeting, 2020.

(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)By The Canadian Press5/25/2020Updated: 5/25/2020PrintVANCOUVER—Money laundering in British Columbia will be under scrutiny again this week when a public inquiry resumes today.Over the next 3-1/2 weeks, expert witnesses ranging from academics to police officers are expected to shed light on how dirty money is quantified and the regulatory models that are being used to fight it around the globe.The B.C. government called the inquiry amid growing concern that illegal cash was helping fuel its real estate, luxury car, and gambling sectors.Opening arguments were held in February and the main hearings scheduled to begin in September will delve into specific industries.Commission lawyer Brock Martland says the goal of this part of the inquiry is to create an understanding of what money laundering is and the strategies other countries have used to get a grip on it.The hearings are being streamed online.Expert witnesses will include Simon Lord of the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency, RCMP Chief Supt. Robert Gilchrist of the Criminal Intelligence Service of Canada, and Oliver Bullough, author of “Moneyland: The Inside Story of the Crooks and Kleptocrats Who Rule the World.”“The sort of game plan is to have the view from 30,000 feet,” Martland said.The inquiry is being led by commissioner Austin Cullen. Attorney General David Eby has said he hopes it will answer lingering questions about how the criminal activity has flourished in the province.B.C. also commissioned three reports that revealed B.C.’s gambling, real estate, and luxury car industries were hotbeds for dirty money, but Eby said an inquiry will be able to dig deeper because it can compel witnesses to speak.In February, the B.C. Real Estate Association told the inquiry that it supported the creation of a provincial land registry that identifies those buying property. It has also struck a working group to make anti-money laundering recommendations.The B.C. Lottery Corp. said it has consistently reported suspicious transactions to Fintrac and pointed out unusual conduct to the gaming policy enforcement branch.The corporation has also brought in measures to control or prevent the flow of dirty money since 2012, including creating an anti-money laundering unit made up of certified investigators and intelligence analysts.And the Great Canadian Gaming Corp., which owns several B.C. gambling sites, also defended the company’s efforts to limit money laundering, telling the inquiry that criticism of the industry is unfounded.A coalition of tax fairness groups told the inquiry at the time that hiding ill−gotten cash behind shell companies is so widespread in Canada it’s known globally as “snow washing.” Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowThe Canadian PressAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesRCMP Form National Co-ordination Team in Response to Extortion SchemesFeb 15, 2024RCMP Use of Private-Sector Surveillance Services Worries Federal Privacy WatchdogFeb 15, 2024Prime Minister and Manitoba Premier Announce $633M in Health FundingFeb 15, 2024Some Members of Parliament, Ministers Assigned Police Protection as Security TightensFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsBritish Columbiamoney launderingCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

(Kacper Pempel/Reuters)By Reuters7/13/2021Updated: 7/13/2021PrintWARSAW—A top Polish court will rule on Tuesday on whether the country’s constitution or European Union treaties take precedence, the first of two rulings this week that could bring Warsaw’s conflict with Brussels over the rule of law to a head.Warsaw aims to hit back at what it says is unjustified interference in its internal affairs by the European Commission, but critics say that questioning the primacy of EU law undermines the functioning of the bloc and jeopardises Poland’s continued membership.Poland is embroiled in a long-running dispute with the EU over judicial reforms that critics say undermine the independence of the judiciary, but which the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party say are needed to make courts function more effectively and remove a residue of communist influence.Poland says the reforms are an internal matter.“We have seen in recent years that EU bodies such as the European Commission or the Court of Justice of the European Union acted in violation of the treaties when they decided to interfere in the Polish judicial system,” said Deputy Justice Minister Sebastian Kaleta.‘Crossing the Rubicon’Poland said in March that Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki would ask the Constitutional Tribunal to rule on whether the country’s constitution or EU treaties are more important. The tribunal will rule on this on Tuesday.As part of proceedings initiated by Brussels against Poland, the Court of Justice of the EU told Warsaw last year to suspend a panel created to discipline judges.The panel—the Supreme Court’s disciplinary chamber—asked the Constitutional Tribunal whether such a suspension was constitutional. The tribunal will also rule on this on Wednesday.The European Commission has asked Poland not to question the primacy of EU law, expressing concern that it is contesting the bloc’s fundamental principles, and some observers have warned of potentially serious consequences if it does so.“In my view if they [PiS] do cross the rubicon... not only infringement actions are on the table,” said Laurent Pech, professor of European law at Middlesex University, London.“I would say that it is going to make it very easy to activate the rule of law conditionality mechanism, so that should also result most likely in a suspension of EU funding.”Government critics say the Constitutional Tribunal itself has become politicized as a result of PiS’s reforms, an accusation the government denies.The tribunal’s head, Julia Przylebska, was described by PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski as a “close friend.”The European Court of Human Rights ruled in May that a Polish company had been denied its right to a proper hearing in the Constitutional Tribunal due to the illegal appointment of a judge.By Alan Charlish Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowReutersAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected Articles2 Fans Came to See Kansas City Chiefs; They Stopped Suspected ShooterFeb 15, 2024Wall Street Opens Flat After Mixed Economic DataFeb 15, 2024Private US Moon Lander Launched Half Century After Last Apollo Lunar MissionFeb 15, 2024Dollar Steady Before Data; Yen Slips Despite GDP SurpriseFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsPolandjudicial systemCourt of Justice of the European UnionSebastian KaletaCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

I'm going to share with you how I made it and then how to style it two ways. One dressed up and ready for a day in the office and one as cosy loungewear! I used the Jackson Tee and sweater pattern by Helens Closet which you can find here > Jackson Tee and Pullover » Helen's Closet Patterns (helensclosetpatterns.com) and for the snuggest sweater I used this Denim Blue fleece backed sweat shirting from Minerva which you can grab here > Minerva Core Range Melange Polycotton Fleece Back Sweatshirt Stretch Knit Fabric | 1422460 | Minerva The Jackson, comes as both a Tee pattern with short sleeves and as a sweater both of which can be a longer or cropped shape. I chose the sweater with long sleeves and the shorter more cropped length as I think its more flattering and suits my style more. The first step was to join the front and back bodice at the shoulders. The next step is to stitch the sleeves onto the bodice, right sides together. Next up we stitch the long side seam together from the sleeve cuff all the way through the under arm right down to the waistband. We're almost finished as this is such a quick make, just the cuffs, neck band and waist band to apply and we're all ready to style it up! I really love how this sweater can be styled up with some nice black shoes, smart trousers and a crisp white shirt under neath, I think this is a perfect smart work wear outfit. However, come he weekend, this styling as lounge wear with some cosy joggers could not be more comfy!! Enjoyed the project? WOW SAVE You can do it!

I came across another of this table - an exact match - and decided to try a different technique with the same design. This was how it looked before This time, I decided to paint the base in Velvet Finishes Luxurious, which is a really nice black. Velvet Finishes paints have a sheen to them that is perfect. I believe I am telling this right in that they are a mineral paint -- they are not such a matte, FLAT finish as chalk paint. On the top I used Wise Owl Chalk Paint in the color Sterling. I feel this white has a grey undertone to it and would complement my design well. I then created the design to use on the table (it's just a little bit different than the first calla lily table I had done). And I got to work staining. I use MinWax Ebony stain to create my artwork. For the stamens, I used Wise Owl Paints in the color Beeswax mixed with General Finishes wood dye in yellow. This adds just a touch of color, which makes the piece have one more added dimension. So here is a picture of the previous calla lily stained table - the wood version, unpainted top. You can read more about this project here: http://www.mmembellishments.com/single-post/2016/07/18/Hand-Stained-Calla-Lily-Coffee-Table Which do you prefer? I would be very interested in your feedback as to which you prefer. Btw, the stained one I did was a much more subtle effect than the pieces I typically do. I didn't take the wood down quite as raw or light as I normally do, so the staining ended up being quite subtle. I would love for you to pop over to my facebook page and give me some love! :) You can also follow along on my website: www.mmembellishments.com Enjoyed the project? WOW SAVE You can do it!

I much prefer that over the wood stained one. I've always been a fan of black and white, in fact, have had many rooms decorated in those colors over the years. My question is -- is this for sale ? I would buy this in a heartbeat !! My mom's favorite flowers were calla lilies -- she carried them when she married my dad. This table would be a lovely remembrance of her. Please let me know !!
