Credit: Adapted and used with permission from Amgen A new type of targeted immunotherapy drug shrank tumors in about one in three people with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the most aggressive form of lung cancer, according to results from a clinical trial. The findings are encouraging because little progress has been made in treating advanced SCLC, experts said. Many people with SCLC respond to initial treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. But the cancer usually progresses despite additional treatment, with most of these patients dying within weeks or months. The early-stage clinical trial tested two different doses of an experimental drug called tarlatamab in people with SCLC whose cancer had progressed after at least two previous types of treatment. Many people in the study had already received at least three different treatments. In the trial, tumors shrank in 40% of people given 10 mg of tarlatamab every 2 weeks and in about 32% of people who received a 100 mg dose. Furthermore, in more than half of all patients whose tumors shrank with tarlatamab, the treatment kept the cancer at bay for at least 6 months—and in many, it did so for 9 months or longer. This last finding was especially noteworthy, said Anish Thomas, M.D., of NCI’s Center for Cancer Research, who studies SCLC but was not involved in the trial. “This is probably one of the most promising treatments being tested in small cell lung cancer right now,” Dr. Thomas said. The new findings are “hopeful for patients and the people who treat them, especially since this is such an aggressive disease with very few advances in treatment since the 1980s,” he continued. Results of the trial—known as DeLLphi-301 and funded by Amgen, the company that makes tarlatamab—were presented October 20 at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) in Madrid and published the same day in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The new findings “support the use of tarlatamab in these previously treated patients,” said the trial’s senior investigator, Luis Paz-Ares, M.D., Ph.D., of Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre in Madrid, who presented the results at the ESMO meeting. The findings are “encouraging,” agreed Pilar Garrido, M.D., Ph.D., of Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal in Madrid, who spoke about the trial at the ESMO meeting but was not involved in it. However, she noted that patients need to be hospitalized to manage potentially serious side effects when they first receive the drug, which poses logistical challenges to its use. Dr. Garrido also noted the need for more data on the effectiveness of tarlatamab against SCLC that has spread to the brain and for a biomarker that can predict which patients will respond to the drug. According to Dr. Paz-Ares, the manufacturer of tarlatamab has already launched a large clinical trial comparing tarlatamab with standard chemotherapy in people with SCLC that has come back after one initial treatment. Tarlatamab harnesses T cells to destroy small cell lung cancer cells Tarlatamab is a type of immunotherapy known as a bispecific T-cell engager, or BiTE. These two-armed drugs simultaneously latch onto tumor cells and immune cells called T cells. By bringing T cells and cancer cells close together, they help the T cell recognize and destroy the cancer cell. The arm of tarlatamab that targets small cell lung cancer cells attaches to a protein called DLL3. This protein is normally located inside cells but is often present at high levels on the surface of SCLC cells, where it can be recognized by tarlatamab. That makes DLL3 “a very attractive target in SCLC,” Dr. Garrido said. The trial enrolled more than 200 people with advanced, or extensive-stage, SCLC that had progressed or was no longer responding to treatment. All of the participants had previously been treated with chemotherapy, and many had also been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, a different type of immunotherapy drug. All participants had received at least two prior therapies, and one-third had received three or more. The study team analyzed the response to tarlatamab in 100 participants who received 10 mg of tarlatamab by infusion every 2 weeks and another 88 who received 100 mg every 2 weeks. An additional 34 patients on the 10-mg dose were included in the analysis of side effects. The 40% response rate (tumor shrinkage) seen in the 10-mg group “far exceeded” the 15% response rate that has historically been seen in people treated with standard therapies for SCLC that has relapsed, Dr. Paz-Ares and his colleagues wrote in NEJM. Furthermore, 30% of those patients who responded to the drug had responses lasting at least 9 months. That finding is “exciting,” Dr. Thomas said, because the cancer usually grows so rapidly. The median time that people in the 10-mg group lived after starting on tarlatamab was 14.3 months, compared with 6–12 months with current treatments. Researchers are still following the trial participants to learn more about tarlatamab’s side effects and its impact on how long people live. Based on the initial results of DeLLphi-301, the lower (10 mg) dose of tarlatamab will be used in future clinical trials, Dr. Paz-Ares said. Common and potentially serious side effects of tarlatamab The side effects of tarlatamab were generally “manageable,” Dr. Paz-Ares said, and only about 3% of patients in the study stopped treatment entirely because of side effects. In addition, 13% of people in the 10-mg group and 29% in the 100-mg group had to temporarily pause treatment, have their dose reduced, or both, due to side effects. The most common side effect of tarlatamab was cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction in which inflammation spreads throughout the body. Other common side effects included decreased appetite, fever, and anemia. About one-third of the patients experienced severe side effects, including serious cases of cytokine release syndrome. Severe side effects were more frequent in those receiving the higher dose of tarlatamab. Most cases of cytokine release syndrome were “manageable and typically treated with supportive care,” such as intravenous fluids and drugs to control fever and inflammation, Dr. Paz-Ares said. However, one person in the 10-mg group died from respiratory failure resulting from treatment. Another potentially serious side effect of tarlatamab is ICANS (immune effector cell−associated neurotoxicity syndrome), which includes a host of neurological effects such as severe confusion, attention problems, tremor, and muscle weakness. ICANS was more common in patients in the 100-mg treatment group and led one patient in each dose group to stop treatment entirely. Both ICANS and cytokine release syndrome are commonly seen with immunotherapies that activate T cells to kill cancer cells, including other BiTEs and CAR T-cell therapy. Challenges, concerns, and questions remain Dr. Thomas noted that the trial was not designed to compare tarlatamab with standard therapy for SCLC. “But there is strong historical data on how quickly the disease progresses with standard therapy.” Another issue, he said, is that current practice calls for treating all patients with extensive-stage SCLC with chemotherapy plus an immune checkpoint inhibitor at the time of diagnosis. However, about one in four people in the trial had not been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. So it would be good to know how well tarlatamab works specifically for people whose cancer has come back despite previous immunotherapy, he explained. Possible side effects are also a concern. There were few severe cases of cytokine release syndrome in the trial and most occurred after the first or second dose of tarlatamab. Still, the potential risk of side effects with early doses “is an important consideration,” Dr. Thomas said, because patients had to be hospitalized for a couple of days as a precaution when receiving each of the first two or three infusions of tarlatamab. In addition, people had to be in generally good physical condition to participate in the trial, and the impact of potentially serious side effects could be greater in those who are sicker, he continued. For all these reasons, Dr. Thomas said, it will be important to know “how we can best manage side effects such that we don’t need to admit patients to the hospital, and how we can anticipate, prevent, and treat side effects.” He also pointed out that some patients died within 6 weeks after their treatment began, before the study team could assess if the deaths were due to worsening of the cancer. And “we need to better understand whether these early deaths were due to side effects,” he said. Finally, Dr. Garrido said, another challenge is identifying biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to respond to tarlatamab. The research team looked at DLL3 on tumor cells as a potential biomarker, but whether a person responded to the drug did not appear to be linked to having DLL3 in their tumors, the study team reported. “Despite the many challenges,” Dr. Garrido said, the results “offer renewed hope to our patients.” < Older Post Groundbreaking Trial Results Expand Treatment Options for Some People with Bladder Cancer Newer Post > What Comes after NCI-MATCH?

These exams and tests often include: Taking your health history. Your health care team may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, physical activity and exercise habits. You also may talk about your eating patterns and appetite control. Your health care professional may ask about other conditions you've had, medicines you take, your stress levels and other issues about your health. They may also review your family's health history to see if you may be more likely to have certain conditions. A general physical exam. This includes measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen. Calculating your BMI. Your health care professional checks your body mass index, called BMI. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obesity. Numbers higher than 30 increase health risks even more. Have your BMI checked at least once a year. This can help pinpoint your overall health risks and what treatments may be right for you. Measuring your waist size. The distance around your waist is known as the circumference. Fat stored around the waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Women with a waist that measures more than 35 inches (89 centimeters) and men with a waist that's more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) around may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, waist circumference should be checked at least once a year. Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your health care team will evaluate them. Your health care professional also will check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, underactive thyroid, liver problems and diabetes. Gathering this information will help you and your health care team choose the type of treatment that will work best for you. Care at Mayo Clinic Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your obesity-related health concerns Start Here More InformationObesity care at Mayo ClinicCholesterol testLiver function testsBMI and waist circumference calculatorShow more related information TreatmentThe goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. This improves overall health and lowers the risk of developing complications related to obesity. You may need to work with a team of health professionals — including a dietitian, behavioral counselor or an obesity specialist — to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits. The first treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss — 5% to 10% of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms), you'd need to lose only about 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kilograms) for your health to begin to improve. But the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits. All weight-loss programs require that you change your eating habits and get more active. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your weight, your overall health and your willingness to participate in a weight-loss plan. Dietary changesReducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are key to overcoming obesity. Although you may lose weight quickly at first, steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest way to lose weight. It's also the best way to keep weight off permanently. There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include: Cutting calories. The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. The first step is to review your typical eating and drinking habits. You can see how many calories you usually consume and where you can cut back. You and your health care professional can decide how many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight. A typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men. Feeling full on less. Some foods — such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods — contain a lot of calories for a small portion. In contrast, fruits and vegetables provide a larger portion size with fewer calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you can reduce hunger pangs and take in fewer calories. You also may feel better about your meal, which contributes to how satisfied you feel overall. Making healthier choices. To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods. These include fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Also emphasize lean sources of protein — such as beans, lentils and soy — and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week. Limit salt and added sugar. Eat small amounts of fats, and make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils. Restricting certain foods. Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your health care professional which diet plans are effective and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended. Limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories. Meal replacements. These plans suggest replacing one or two meals each day with their products — such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars — and eating healthy snacks. Then you have a healthy, balanced third meal that's low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. But these diets likely won't teach you how to change your overall lifestyle. So you may have to stay on the diet if you want to keep your weight off. Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. But the reality is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, but the long-term results don't appear to be any better than other diets. Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you're likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To lose weight — and keep it off — you must adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over time. Exercise and activityGetting more physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment: Exercise. People with obesity need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity. This can help prevent further weight gain or maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. You'll probably need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve. Keep moving. Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. For example, park farther from store entrances and take the stairs instead of the elevator. A pedometer can track how many steps you take over the course of a day. Many people try to reach 10,000 steps every day. Gradually increase the number of steps you take daily to reach your goal. Behavior changesA behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes to lose weight and keep it off. Steps to take include looking at your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may have contributed to your obesity. Counseling. Talking with a mental health professional can help address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You also can learn how to monitor your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Counseling can be one-on-one or in a group. Support groups. You can find friendship and understanding in support groups where others share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your health care team, local hospitals or commercial weight-loss programs for support groups in your area. Weight-loss medicinesWeight-loss medicines are meant to be used along with diet, exercise and behavior changes, not instead of them. Before selecting a medication for you, your health care professional will consider your health history, as well as possible side effects. The most commonly used medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity include: Bupropion-naltrexone (Contrave). Liraglutide (Saxenda). Orlistat (Alli, Xenical). Phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia). Semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy). Weight-loss medicines may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. When you stop taking a weight-loss medicine, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost. Endoscopic procedures for weight lossThese types of procedures don't require any cuts, also called incisions, in the skin. After you are under anesthesia, flexible tubes and tools are inserted through the mouth and down the throat into the stomach. Common procedures include: Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty. This procedure involves placing stitches in the stomach to reduce the amount of food and liquid the stomach can hold at one time. Over time, eating and drinking less helps the average person lose weight. Intragastric balloon for weight loss. In this procedure, you have a small balloon placed into the stomach. The balloon is then filled with water to reduce the amount of space in the stomach, so you'll feel full eating less food. Intragastric balloons are left in place for up to 6 months and are then removed using an endoscope. At that time, a new balloon may be placed, or not, depending on the plan determined by you and your health care team. Weight-loss surgeryAlso known as bariatric surgery, weight-loss surgery limits how much food you can eat. Some procedures also limit the amount of calories and nutrients you can absorb. But this also can result in nutritional and vitamin deficiencies. Common weight-loss surgeries include: Adjustable gastric banding. In this surgery, an inflatable band placed around the outside of the stomach divides it into two pouches. The surgeon pulls the band tight, like a belt, to create a narrow pathway between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from getting bigger. The band often stays in place permanently. Gastric bypass surgery. In gastric bypass, also called Roux-en-Y (roo-en-wy) gastric bypass, the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into this part of the intestine, bypassing most of the stomach. Gastric sleeve. In this surgery, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food. It's a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. Other treatmentsOther treatments for obesity include: Hydrogels. Available by prescription, these edible capsules contain tiny particles that absorb water and get bigger in the stomach, to help you feel full. The capsules are taken before meals and are passed through the intestines as stool. Vagal nerve blockade. This involves implanting a device under the skin in the stomach area. The device sends electrical pulses to a nerve in that area, called the abdominal vagus nerve. This nerve tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. Gastric aspirate. In this procedure, a tube is placed through the abdomen into the stomach. A portion of the stomach contents are drained out after each meal.

Lifestyle and home remediesYour effort to overcome obesity is more likely to be successful if you follow strategies at home along with your formal treatment plan. These can include: Learning about your condition. Education about obesity can help you learn more about why you developed obesity and what you can do about it. You may feel more empowered to take control and stick to your treatment plan. Read reputable self-help books and consider talking about them with your health care professional or therapist. Setting realistic goals. When you have to lose a lot of weight, you may set goals that are unrealistic, such as trying to lose too much too fast. Don't set yourself up for failure. Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss. Make small changes in your diet instead of attempting drastic changes that you're not likely to stick with for the long haul. Sticking to your treatment plan. Changing a lifestyle you may have lived with for many years can be hard to do. Be honest with your doctor, therapist or other health care professionals if you find your activity or eating goals slipping. You can work together to come up with new ideas or new approaches. Enlisting support. Get your family and friends on board with your weight-loss goals. Surround yourself with people who will support you and help you, not sabotage your efforts. Make sure they understand how important weight loss is to your health. You also might want to join a weight-loss support group. Keeping a record. Keep a food and activity log. This record can help you remain accountable for your eating and exercise habits. You can discover things that may be holding you back. You also might see what works well for you. You can use your log to track other important health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels and overall fitness. Alternative medicineMany dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The long-term effectiveness and safety of these products are often questionable. Coping and supportTalk to your health care professional or therapist about improving your coping skills. Consider these tips to cope with obesity and your weight-loss efforts: Journal. Write in a journal to express pain, anger, fear or other emotions. Connect. Don't become isolated. Try to participate in regular activities and get together with family or friends periodically. Join. Join a support group so that you can connect with others facing similar challenges. Focus. Stay focused on your goals. Overcoming obesity is an ongoing process. Stay motivated by keeping your goals in mind. Remind yourself that you're responsible for managing your condition and working toward your goals. Relax. Learn relaxation and stress management. Learning to recognize stress and developing stress management and relaxation skills can help you gain control of unhealthy eating habits. Preparing for your appointmentTalking to your health care professional openly and honestly about your weight concerns is one of the best things you can do for your health. In some cases, you may be referred to an obesity specialist — if one is available in your area. You also may be referred to a behavioral counselor or dietitian. What you can doBeing an active participant in your care is important. One way to do this is by preparing for your appointment. Think about your needs and goals for treatment. Also, write down a list of questions to ask. These questions may include: What eating or activity habits are likely contributing to my health concerns and weight gain? What can I do about the challenges I face in managing my weight? Do I have other health problems that are caused by obesity? Should I see a dietitian? Should I see a behavioral counselor with expertise in weight management? What are the treatment options for obesity and my other health problems? Is weight-loss surgery or another intervention an option for me? Be sure to let your health care team know about any medical conditions you have and about any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you take. What to expect from your doctorDuring your appointment, your health care professional is likely to ask you a number of questions about your weight, eating, activity, mood and thoughts, and any symptoms you might have. You may be asked questions such as: How much did you weigh in high school? What life events may have been associated with weight gain? What, when and how much do you eat in a typical day? How much activity do you get in a typical day? During what periods of your life did you gain weight? What are the factors that you believe affect your weight? How is your daily life affected by your weight? What diets or treatments have you tried to lose weight? What are your weight-loss goals? Are you ready to make changes in your lifestyle to lose weight? What do you think might prevent you from losing weight? What you can do in the meantimeIf you have time before your scheduled appointment, you can get ready for the appointment by keeping a diet diary for two weeks before the appointment. You also can record how many steps you take in a day by using a step counter, called a pedometer. And you can begin to make choices that will help you start to lose weight, including: Making healthy changes in your diet. Include more fruits, vegetables and whole grains in your diet. Begin to reduce portion sizes. Increasing your activity level. Try to get up and move around your home more often. Start gradually if you aren't in good shape or aren't used to exercising. Even a 10-minute daily walk can help. If you have any health conditions or are over a certain age — over 40 for men and over 50 for women — wait until you've talked to your health care professional before you start a new exercise program.

The nonprofit, user-driven online encyclopedia is initially an offshoot of another free encyclopedia project called Nupedia founded by Jimmy Wales. However, Nupedia’s reliance on expert contributors makes progress too slow. Then Wales and Nupedia employee Larry Sanger decide to try a complementary project using wiki technology, which allows anyone to write or edit. The new “Wikipedia” is set up as a non-profit supported by donations and grants with Wales donating the bandwidth and server. By May 2001, Wikipedia expands from English to 13 other languages, including French, Japanese, Hebrew, Russian and Chinese. By the end of the first year, another seven languages are in operation or announced ranging from Arabic to Afrikaans to Polish. NOW Eleven years since its debut, Wikipedia is the fifth highest ranked website in the world, attracting about 475 million unique visitors per month. According to Wikipedia, they have about 82,000 active contributors working on content in 283 languages. Roughly 100 of those have 10,000 or more articles with the latest language to reach the milestone being Singhalese last Thursday. English has the most articles at 3.8 million and the next three most popular languages are German, French, and Dutch. While Wikipedia’s rules state that entries must be on notable subjects, neutral, and verifiable, its collaborative nature, also makes it vulnerable to vandals, propagandists, pranksters, bias, and flame wars, among other hazards, the organization openly acknowledges—particularly for newer articles.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)By AAP6/1/2020Updated: 6/1/2020PrintThe Northern Territory will once again see a rotation of United States Marines despite the COVID-19 pandemic.The first of about 1200 U.S. Marines will arrive in Darwin for joint exercises this week as part of a near decade-long arrangement that has been delayed for two months because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Despite the risk of re-introducing COVID-19 to the Top End, which was declared free of the disease nearly a fortnight ago and not had any locally diagnosed cases for eight weeks, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said in early May the six-month rotation would go ahead.Northern Territory Health Minister Natasha Fyles said strict guidelines had been placed on the rotation with all Marines to quarantine for 14 days on a military base when they arrive in Darwin.“There is a very, very low risk to the community,” she told reporters.Each Marine will be screened four days before departure, screened and tested upon arrival in Australia and at the end of the quarantine period.Rotation numbers had been reduced to 1200 with troops coming in smaller groups during June and July and will stay in Australia until September.The Northern Territory’s last two cases of COVID-19 were two defence force members who contracted it in the Middle East and who flew back to Darwin to recover in hospital.The first U.S. service member to test positive was based in South Korea. He had recovered and was released in mid-April after 49 days in isolation.The 2019 rotation consisted of 2500 U.S. Marines and a range of aircraft and other equipment.By Greg Roberts Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowAAPAuthor FollowAustralian Associated Press is an Australian news agency.Author’s Selected ArticlesJudge Faces ‘Inadequate’ Laws in Stabbing SentenceFeb 16, 2024Half of Town Lost to Bushfire as Residents Count LossesFeb 16, 2024Sixteen Homes ‘Uninhabitable’ as Outage Compo CappedFeb 16, 2024Bushfire Evacuees Return to Homes and BusinessesFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsUnited StatesMarinesNorthern TerritoryCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)By Katabella Roberts2/13/2023Updated: 2/13/2023PrintX 10:00SpaceX founder Elon Musk has defended his company’s decision to limit Ukraine’s use of the company’s Starlink satellite internet service for military purposes, noting that the spacecraft manufacturer and communications company will not actively enable an escalation in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.Musk was responding to former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who called on the Tesla CEO on Feb. 11 to “restore the full functionality” of Starlink satellites, adding that Ukraine “desperately needs your continued support.”“Defense from a genocidal invasion is not an offensive capability. It’s survival. Innocent lives will be lost. You can help. Thank you,” Kelly wrote on Twitter.However, Musk replied that the Starlink satellite communication network is playing a key role in ensuring communication in Ukraine but should not be used for escalation that could lead to a World War.“You’re smart enough not to swallow media and other propaganda bs,” Musk responded. “Starlink is the communication backbone of Ukraine, especially at the front lines, where almost all other Internet connectivity has been destroyed. But we will not enable escalation of conflict that may lead to WW3.”Musk’s response comes after SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said on Feb. 9 that the company was restricting Ukraine’s military from using Starlink to control drones in the region for military purposes against Russia.Shotwell, SpaceX’s chief operating officer, said during a conference in Washington that the company’s Starlink satellite internet service was “never meant to be weaponized,” but that “Ukrainians have leveraged it in ways that were unintentional and not part of any agreement.”Shotwell referenced reports that Ukraine’s military had used the Starlink service to control drones and noted that Ukraine’s agreement with SpaceX was intended for humanitarian purposes such as providing broadband internet to civilians well as hospitals and banks after Russian forced destroyed much of the country’s telecommunications infrastructure.“There are things that we can do to limit their ability to do that,” she said, referring to the reports. “There are things that we can do, and have done.”“We know the military is using them for comms, and that’s ok,” Shotwell added. “But our intent was never to have them use it for offensive purposes.”Ukraine Hits Out at SpaceXFollowing Shotwell’s announcement, Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wrote on Twitter that SpaceX, as well as other companies, needs to decide whether it is “on the side of [Ukraine] and the right to freedom” or on “[Russia’s] side & its ‘right’ to kill & seize territories.”“SpaceX (Starlink) and Mrs. Shotwell should choose a specific option,” Podolyak added.Musk’s SpaceX has been providing internet to Ukraine free of charge through Starlink’s satellite internet service since the early days of the invasion but has stressed that it is designed for peaceful uses only.Despite Shotwell’s recent announcement, some Ukrainian soldiers told The Washington Post that the service is working largely as normal for front-line communications but there have been some reports of issues with terminals attached to strike drones.“We’ve had no issues so far, thank God,” Lt. Oleksandr Matviyenko, the commander of a drone-reconnaissance unit working around Bakhmut, told the publication.The Epoch Times has contacted SpaceX for comment.Reuters contributed to this report.

In each scripture, he is described as both a protector and a fighter against evil spirits.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

Friends Read Free(Thinkstock)By Sarah Le8/23/2014Updated: 8/23/2014PrintLOS ANGELES—Imagine transforming the voting process—something considered an almost sacred fundamental right—into something akin to buying a lottery ticket. That’s what the Los Angeles city Ethics Commission would like to do to get more people to come out and vote.Voter turnout is at record lows for Los Angeles city elections. Less than 20 percent of registered voters on average came to the polls in 2013, and less than 10 percent showed up for this month’s special school board election, according to official data.City Ethics Commission President Nathan Hochman said the commission has been looking at many options to encourage people to vote, including penalizing people for not voting. Such a system is used in countries like Australia, where it brings more than 90 percent of people to the polls.But another idea seemed more appealing.“We decided that while sticks are an option, we'd take a look at carrots, incentives,” he said. “One of the incentives that City Council President Herb Wesson was very excited about was the notion of a voter drawing.”After Wesson expressed his interest on Aug. 14, the Los Angeles Ethics Commission voted 3–0 to recommend that the city council consider lottery drawings with cash prizes as an incentive to increase voter turnout. The drawing could be used as soon as LA’s 2015 election.The Ethics Commission proposed using surplus matching funds—which are given to candidates who agree to certain spending restrictions—to fund the lottery. Just one percent of these funds could supply four $25,000 prizes or one hundred $1,000 prizes.But there has been criticism of the idea, too. The LA Times Editorial Board called it “one of the worst ideas we’ve heard in a long time,” noting that it “fails to address the deeper reasons why people don’t vote,” including apathy, ignorance, or critical personal issues.Others are concerned that monetary incentives could skew the outcome of an election by bringing uninformed voters to the polls. But the Ethics Commission says studies show that people who know they are going to vote are more likely to pay attention to the issues.“If we weren’t dealing with a crisis, we wouldn’t be considering any of this,” Hochman said. “For the people who don’t want voter drawings as an answer, we invite you to come up with some other solution that will drive significant more numbers to the polls.”Groups such as the Municipal Elections Reform Commission have suggested that changing the dates of city elections from odd- to even-numbered years to coincide with larger elections would help. They also recommend holding fewer special elections to save time and money for the city and voters. Hochman says these changes could take years.Federal law prohibits paying people to vote, but the Ethics Commission says the federal law would not apply to a purely local election.California and Alaska are the only two states that allow incentives for voting, although the money cannot be used to encourage people to vote for a specific candidate or measure.

Mass Murder Victims During Pandemic | The Epoch TimesOpen sidebarADShare This Article, Friends Read FreeSHAREWorld NewsCanadaMourners Struggle to Grieve N.S. Mass Murder Victims During PandemicFriends Read FreeA memorial is set up across the street from the Debert School, where Lisa McCully, one of the victims of a mass shooting by Gabriel Wortman, taught grades 3 and 4, in Debert, Nova Scotia, Canada, on April 20, 2020. (John Morris/Reuters)By The Canadian Press4/21/2020Updated: 4/21/2020PrintThe death toll from a massacre that stretched across rural Nova Scotia last weekend rose to 23 Tuesday as families grappled with the heart-wrenching question of how to mourn during a pandemic that is forcing people to stay apart.Tammy Oliver-McCurdie, whose sister Jolene Oliver, brother-in-law Aaron Tuck and niece Emily Tuck were among the dead, was struggling with how to plan funerals. The victims have loved ones in both Nova Scotia and Alberta, where the sisters grew up, and the pandemic makes travel difficult.“I don’t know what I’m going to do with this whole COVID thing. It’s just so, so much,” an emotional Oliver-McCurdie said from Red Deer Monday. “I know she’s got people who love her here and people who love her there.”Justin Zahl in Halifax was still searching for answers about his parents’ fate days after seeing images of their Portapique, N.S., home’s burnt remains, all while separated from his younger brother who’s in Albuquerque, N.M. He has no relatives in the province, and the Canada-U.S. border closure is keeping the brothers apart.“I don’t know how I’m going to get my sibling up here,” Zahl said in an interview.Premier Stephen McNeil called the rampage that began Saturday night in the quiet community of Portapique and ended at a gas station in Enfield on Sunday “one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province’s history.”But officials reminded Nova Scotians that the community would have to mourn together from a distance to stop the coronavirus from spreading, as cases and deaths from the illness also climbed.Dr. Robert Strang, the province’s chief medical officer of health, acknowledged at his daily news COVID-19 news conference Monday that it would be “hard for people to hear” reminders about the need for physical distancing in the aftermath of the killings.“COVID-19 is not going to pause because of our pain—we cannot let our guard down,” Strang said.Simon Sherry, a professor in the department of psychology and neuroscience at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said while social and ritualized aspects of grief are important, they represent only one part of coping with death and dying.“At an individual level, people can still make meaning and reach acceptance, even amid a pandemic and the heavy weight of a mass shooting,” he said in an interview Tuesday.On Monday night, people across Nova Scotia were asked to express their grief by stepping outside at 8:30 p.m. to light a candle or shine some kind of light.Others have displayed solidarity by posting photos of sunsets across the province. Toronto-based singing group Choir! Choir! Choir! announced a Facebook live performance of Leonard Cohen’s ‘Hallelujah’ scheduled for Thursday. A virtual vigil is planned for Friday evening, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would attend.Sherry said that kind of new ritual can be an important gesture of solidarity.“When your community, when your province is suffering through grief like this, it’s important to emphasize a connection to community .... It’s important to refocus on community.”A memorial with flowers and tributes sprung up outside the RCMP headquarters in Dartmouth this week to honour Const. Heidi Stevenson, who was killed in the line of duty.But Stevenson’s funeral will look different from those held for slain officers at other points in Canadian history _ like the regimental funeral for Fredericton police constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns in August 2018 that was attended by hundreds of police officers and first responders from across the continent.“It’s going to require some out-of-the-box thinking. I really don’t know where they’re even going to begin,” said Brian Sauve, president of the union representing RCMP officers.He said such events are always uniquely tragic and challenging, but there are possibilities available during the pandemic, such as livestreaming and inviting guests to park along roadways.“There are ways in today’s day and age to honour the fallen,” he said. “It’s just in a different format.”Quentrel Provo, an anti-violence and gun control activist who founded Stop the Violence, Spread the Love in Halifax, led a virtual candlelight vigil Monday night, opening with a prayer, a moment of silence and a reading of victims’ names during a livestream on Facebook.Provo said it was emotionally tough to lead the event, which he set up to offer some hope as Nova Scotians feel overwhelmed by the pandemic and the violence of the weekend.“A lot of tears have been shed. I know myself, I’ve cried a lot in the last few days,” he said in a telephone interview Tuesday.“If we’re hurting, it’s unimaginable the pain the families are going through right now, but we’re trying to come together and be strong and show them support during this time.”Provo said he plans to pay tribute to the victims by lighting a candle each night for the next 20 days, and he said people should continue to support each other and the families into the future.Sherry said people should be careful not to suppress their grief during the pandemic—and it’s important to recognize that people will deal with grief in their own way.“There is no one, particular timeline or course that someone needs to follow as they move through grief, loss and trauma,'' he said.

(ISIS)By Jack Phillips7/5/2016Updated: 7/5/2016PrintThe FBI arrested a former National Guard member on July 3 for trying to “provide material support” to the ISIS terrorist group, according to a Department of Justice press release.Mohamed Bailor Jalloh, 26, is alleged to have provided services to ISIS, also known as ISIL or Daesh, for what he believed would be an attack on U.S. soil committed in the name of the terror group, the Department of Justice said.A now-deceased ISIS member “brokered an introduction” between Jalloh and an FBI undercover agent posing as an ISIS supporter, the statement asserts.READ MOREOhio City Apologizes After Muslim Man Mistaken As ISIS MemberJalloh met with the undercover agent on “two occasions in April and May 2016,” telling them he was a former member of the Virginia National Guard.Jalloh’s case is the most recent of several in which men from the northern Virginia area just outside Washington have been charged with attempting to support the Islamic State group.Court records indicate the FBI saw Jalloh buying an assault rifle Saturday at a gun shop in Chantilly. The affidavit is not clear as to whether authorities believe Jalloh planned to use the rifle himself or whether he may have been procuring it on behalf of an informant. He was arrested Sunday.He also asked the undercover FBI agent if it would be better to plan an attack during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, according to the press release.Jalloh’s sister, Fatmatu Jalloh, told The Associated Press in a brief telephone interview that she is serving as one of her brother’s attorneys. She said she had not yet seen the unsealed charges but denied he was the Islamic State group.Jalloh is identified in the affidavit as a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Sierra Leone.In April, Jalloh told the informant he had been thinking about carrying out a Fort Hood-style attack. Asked to explain, Jalloh said, “Nidal Hasan type of things. That’s the kind of stuff I started thinking,” according to the affidavit.If convicted, Jalloh faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)By City News Service3/1/2021Updated: 3/1/2021PrintSANTA ANA—Orange County may find itself close to the less- restrictive red tier in the state’s program for reopening the economy on March 2.As of Feb. 28, the state’s case rate per 100,000 residents was 8.2, the testing positivity rate was at 4.1 percent and the health equity quartile positivity rate, which measures coronavirus prevalence in hot spots in low-income communities, was 5.3 percent, said Orange County chief executive Frank Kim.“It was a rainbow,'' Kim told City News Service. “For the case rate we were purple, but testing positivity was orange and for the health equity we were red.”As of March 1, the case rate was 7.6, testing positivity rate was 3.9 percent and the health equity rate was 5 percent, “which is the lowest health equity rate we’ve had since we were measured for that,” Kim said.The county’s test positivity rate—which is reported weekly on Tuesdays—improved to 5.4 percent last week from 7.8 percent the previous week, and the adjusted case rate per 100,000 on a seven-day average with a seven-day lag improved from 20.7 to 11.9.Kim said it’s possible the county makes it to the red tier March 2.There is a rule that if a county has two measures in orange but one in the most-restrictive purple tier, it can vault up one spot to the red tier. To move up to a less-restrictive tier, though, a county must stay within those metrics for at least two weeks.To get to the red tier, the county has to have a case rate per 100,000 population of 4 to 7, a positivity rate of 5 percent to 8 percent and a Health Equity Quartile rate of 5.3 percent to 8 percent.The red tier allows for many more businesses and organizations to reopen. For instance, retail stores could allow for half capacity instead of 25 percent, and museums, zoos and aquariums could reopen for indoor activities at 25 percent capacity, as could movie theaters, gyms and restaurants.Knott’s Berry Farm in Buena Park on Monday announced a virtual “National Hiring Day'' on March 13 in anticipation of its plan to prepare for reopening. The theme park is looking to hire about 1,700 people for a variety of jobs throughout Knott’s, including food and beverage, cooks, ride operators, lifeguards and janitorial.The Orange County Health Care Agency reported 179 newly diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and four additional deaths on March 1, bringing the county cumulative case number to 246,634 and boosting the death toll to 3,921. HCA officials reported technical issues with the state’s death reports system, so fatalities might be relatively low over the next several days.The fatality reports are staggered as they come from a variety of sources. So far in January, the deadliest month of the pandemic, the county has reported 1,231 fatalities. December’s death toll stands at 883, while the count for February is at 103.The deadliest day in the pandemic was Jan. 5 when 66 people died of COVID-19-related complications. The December and January fatalities represent 54 percent of the coronavirus death toll since the county’s first fatality on March 19 last year.Hospitalizations due to the coronavirus continued to decline, dropping from 421 Sunday to 419 on Monday, with the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units falling from 132 to 119.The county has 31.1 percent of its ICU beds available and 63 percent of its ventilators, according to the HCA, which reported 5,435 tests March 1 for a total of 3,048,845.

A Wabi Sabi story journey was created to turn the tide in a world where the building of a unique body of knowledge for nursing has fallen into disfavor with nursing itself. Using nature-aligned paintings and a Japanese story-art aesthetic with poetry, the beauty of falling away to unitary essentials and holding the value of “both-and” in unitary consciousness was illuminated.

However, no studies have compared the efficacy of peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonists in patients with adequate and inadequate responses to prior OIC therapy with laxatives. This post hoc analysis of integrated data from the two previous studies compared the efficacy of naldemedine in patients who were unsuccessfully treated with laxatives [poor laxative responders (PLRs)] with those who either did not receive laxatives >30 days prior to screening or those who only received rescue laxative at or after screening (non-PLRs).Methods:Patients with OIC were randomized to once-daily treatment with naldemedine 0.2 mg or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of responders [⩾3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs)/week and an increase from baseline of ⩾1 SBM/week for ⩾9 weeks of the 12-week treatment period and ⩾3 weeks of the final 4 weeks of the 12-week treatment period]. Additional endpoints included change in SBM frequency, change in frequency of SBMs without straining, proportion of complete SBM (CSBM) responders, change in CSBM frequency, and time to first SBM. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed.Results:The analysis included 538 (317 PLRs, 221 non-PLRs) and 537 (311 PLRs, 226 non-PLRs) patients in the naldemedine and placebo arms, respectively. There were significantly more responders in the naldemedine PLR (46.4%; p < 0.0001) and non-PLR (54.3%; p = 0.0009) subgroups versus the placebo groups (30.2% and 38.9%, respectively). In both the PLR and non-PLR subgroups, naldemedine treatment was superior to placebo on all additional endpoints. Overall incidence of TEAEs in the PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine or placebo was similar.Conclusion:This integrated analysis further supports the efficacy and tolerability of naldemedine in the treatment of OIC and demonstrates a consistent effect in both PLR and non-PLR subgroups.[ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01965158 and NCT01993940]IntroductionOpioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most frequent adverse effect associated with opioid analgesic treatment.1 This condition, defined by Rome IV criteria as new or worsening symptoms of constipation that occur when initiating, changing, or increasing the dose of opioid therapy,2 results from the activation of µ-opioid receptors, which have extensive distribution throughout the enteric nervous system in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.1,2 The reported prevalence of OIC is typically around 50% among patients taking opioids for chronic cancer pain and non-cancer pain.3–7 In one prospective study in cancer patients, about half developed OIC within 2 weeks of beginning opioid therapy.7Unlike other adverse effects associated with opioid therapy, OIC persists unabated over time, even with use of laxatives.8 Opioids interfere with motility, secretion, and sphincter function.9–13 Traditional laxatives (stool softeners, osmotics, stimulants, salines, and rectal options) are often used for treatment of OIC but do not target µ-opioid receptors, to which opioids bind in the myenteric and submucosal nerve plexi of the GI tract; therefore, they do not directly block these adverse effects on GI function.11,14 Studies have reported that 40%–94% of patients taking laxatives for management of OIC have an inadequate response.3,14 As a result, these patients may experience a range of GI symptoms that have a negative impact on quality of life, activities of daily living, and work productivity.3,14 In an effort to reduce GI symptoms, patients may skip or reduce the opioid dose, leading to inadequate pain relief.3,14,15Naldemedine is an oral, once-daily, peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) approved in Japan, the United States (US), and Europe for the treatment of OIC in adults.16–19 The efficacy and safety of once-daily naldemedine 0.2 mg versus placebo in patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC were established in two 12-week studies (COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2) and a 52-week study (COMPOSE-3).20,21 Recent clinical guidelines recommend treatment with a PAMORA when traditional laxatives fail.22,23 Therefore, it is of relevance to examine treatment responses, both in patients with a history of an inadequate response to prior laxative therapy [poor laxative responders (PLRs)] and in those who had not had a poor response to prior laxatives (non-PLRs).The objective of this post hoc analysis was to characterize the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of naldemedine 0.2 mg once daily versus placebo for up to 12 weeks in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain from COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 in PLRs and non-PLRs. No studies have previously examined the efficacy of PAMORAs in these subgroups of patients. We hypothesized that PLRs may represent a specific subgroup of patients who are less responsive to medications for constipation in general, in which case PLR patients may be less responsive to naldemedine than non-PLR patients.MethodsStudy designCOMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 [ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01965158 and NCT01993940, respectively] were identically designed randomized, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase III studies conducted in 68 and 69 centers, respectively, between August 2013 and June 2015.20 Study protocols were approved by independent ethics committees at each site and all institutional review boards (Supplemental Table S1). The studies were performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable local Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations. All patients provided written informed consent. The data from COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 were integrated for this analysis.Table 1.

Patients were not currently using, or were willing to discontinue, laxatives. After discontinuation of laxatives and a 2- to 4-week screening/qualification period to verify OIC symptomatology and eligibility, enrolled patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 12 weeks of once-daily treatment with naldemedine 0.2 mg or matching placebo (Figure 1).20 Criteria for OIC during screening included: ⩽4 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) in qualifying period; ⩽3 SBMs in any 7-day period during screening, and ⩾1 incidence of straining, hard, or lumpy stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, or sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage with ⩾25% of bowel movements. Key exclusion criteria were evidence/history of bowel structural abnormalities, strictures, obstructions, or history of bowel surgery; medical conditions affecting GI transit; history of chronic constipation unrelated to opioid use; and no history of laxative use for OIC.Figure 1. Study design. PLRs were defined as patients who were on laxative therapy prior to entering the study and who stopped its use within 30 days prior to screening. Non-PLRs were defined as patients who stopped laxatives >30 days prior to screening or who only received rescue laxative at or after screening.Non-PLR, non-poor laxative responder; OIC, opioid-induced constipation; PLR, poor laxative responder; QD, once daily; R, randomization.AssessmentsThe primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of responders, defined as patients with ⩾3 SBMs per week and an increase from baseline of ⩾1 SBM per week for ⩾9 weeks of the 12-week treatment period and ⩾3 weeks of the final 4 weeks of the 12-week treatment period.20 Additional efficacy endpoints included the least-squares mean (LSM) change from baseline in the frequency of SBMs per week to each week of the treatment period; the change from baseline in frequency of SBMs without straining (defined as a straining score of 0) per week to the last 2 weeks of the treatment period; the proportion of complete SBM (CSBM) responders, with CSBM responders defined as having ⩾3 CSBMs per week and an increase from baseline of ⩾1 CSBM per week for ⩾9 weeks of the 12-week treatment period and ⩾3 weeks of the final 4 weeks of the 12-week treatment period; the change from baseline in the frequency of CSBMs per week to each week of the treatment period; and the time to first SBM after the initial dose of study drug.Safety was assessed using incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs in the GI disorders system organ class (SOC), and major cardiovascular events.20 Adverse events were coded to SOC and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 16.0. TEAEs were assessed for the population comprising all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication.20Statistical analysisFor the purpose of integration, efficacy data included in this analysis are from first dose up to 12 weeks of treatment in the COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 studies and do not include data collected during the follow-up periods. Efficacy analyses were based on the intent-to-treat population comprising all randomized patients. Safety analyses were based on the safety population comprising all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication.20 The data presented here represent a post hoc analysis of two groups of patients who were either PLRs or non-PLRs. PLRs were defined as patients who, based on concomitant medication records, were on laxative therapy with at least one product prior to entering the study and who stopped its use within 30 days prior to screening.24 Non-PLRs were defined as patients who did not receive laxatives (laxatives stopped >30 days prior to screening) or who received rescue laxative only at or after screening.24Comparisons were made between the naldemedine PLR and placebo PLR subgroups and the naldemedine non-PLR and placebo non-PLR subgroups, as well as the PLR and non-PLR subgroups for patients treated with naldemedine. Analysis of the primary efficacy outcome (proportion of SBM responders) and the proportion of CSBM responders used the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test adjusted for opioid dose strata. A mixed-effect repeat-measures model was used for change from baseline in SBM and CSBM frequency at each week.20 Analysis of covariance using the opioid dose strata as a covariate was applied to the change from baseline in frequency of SBMs without straining.20 Time to first SBM was evaluated using the generalized Wilcoxon test adjusted by study. The Clopper–Pearson method was used to calculate confidence intervals (CIs) for differences between the PLR and non-PLR subgroups for efficacy endpoints.20 Incidences of TEAEs were summarized descriptively and presented along with treatment differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the PLR and non-PLR subgroups. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2.ResultsStudy populationThe integrated efficacy analysis of COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 included 549 and 546 patients in the naldemedine and placebo arms, respectively. Of these, 11 patients in the naldemedine group and 9 patients in the placebo group could not be categorized as PLR or non-PLR. Overall, 317 PLR patients were randomized to naldemedine and 311 to placebo. A total of 221 and 226 non-PLR patients were randomized to naldemedine and placebo, respectively. A summary of the integrated patient demographics, baseline characteristics, and opioid use is presented in Table 1.Patient groups were generally well matched between naldemedine and placebo and between PLR and non-PLR subgroups with no statistical differences between groups, although a lower proportion of patients in the non-PLR group receiving naldemedine was White, and a higher proportion was Black, relative to the other study arms. Additionally, a higher proportion of PLR patients versus non-PLR patients had at least one bowel movement at baseline without a feeling of complete evacuation.EfficacyPrimary efficacy endpointThe proportion of SBM responders in the integrated efficacy population are illustrated in Figure 2. Similar to the overall group, there were significantly more responders in the naldemedine PLR (46.4%; p < 0.0001) and non-PLR subgroups (54.3%; p = 0.0009) compared with the placebo groups (30.2% and 38.9%, respectively). The difference in proportion of SBM responders between the PLR subgroup and the non-PLR subgroup treated with naldemedine was significant (95% CI: −18.1, −0.6; p = 0.037).Figure 2.

There was no significant difference in change from baseline between the PLR and non-PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine throughout the 12-week study period (p > 0.05 at each time point).Figure 3.

However, there was no significant difference in change from baseline between the proportion of SBMs without straining in the PLR and non-PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine (95% CI: −0.72, 0.30; p = 0.42).Figure 4.

However, there was no significant difference between the proportion of CSBM responders in the PLR and non-PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine (95% CI: −15.2, 0.8; p = 0.073). A significant increase in change from baseline in CSBM frequency with naldemedine was established at week 1 with naldemedine versus placebo in both the PLR and non-PLR subgroups and was maintained throughout the 12-week study period (p < 0.001 at each time point; data not shown). There was no significant difference in change from baseline between the PLR and non-PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine throughout the 12-week study period (p > 0.05 at each time point).The time to first SBM was significantly shorter for the naldemedine groups versus the placebo groups (Figure 5). In the PLR subgroup, the median time to first SBM was 18.3 h for naldemedine and 47.5 h for placebo (p < 0.0001) [Figure 5a]. In the non-PLR subgroup, the median time to first SBM was 15.3 h for naldemedine and 44.9 h for placebo (p < 0.0001) [Figure 5b]. No difference was apparent between the PLR and non-PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine [Figure 5c].Figure 5.

Treatment-related TEAEs occurred in 22.2% and 17.0% of PLR patients in the naldemedine and placebo groups, respectively, compared with 19.1% and 9.7% in the non-PLR naldemedine and placebo groups, respectively. TEAEs leading to discontinuations occurred in 4.8% and 3.5% of PLR patients in the naldemedine and placebo groups, respectively, compared with 5.5% and 0.9% in the non-PLR naldemedine and placebo groups, respectively. For both treatment-related TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation, significantly higher rates were observed with naldemedine versus placebo in the non-PLR subgroup but not in the PLR subgroup (Table 2).Table 2.

There were few serious treatment-related TEAEs, with three in the PLR subgroup treated with naldemedine (1%), one each in the PLR placebo group (0.3%) and non-PLR naldemedine subgroup (0.5%), and none in the non-PLR placebo group. One patient each (0.3%) in the PLR naldemedine and placebo arms had major adverse cardiovascular events of myocardial infarction. There was one death in the PLR naldemedine subgroup (0.3%) due to an opioid overdose.DiscussionThis post hoc analysis from two phase III clinical studies demonstrated the benefits of naldemedine over placebo in subgroups of patients either with or without recent prior laxative use for treatment of OIC. Significant improvements from baseline in the mean frequency of SBMs and CSBMs for naldemedine versus placebo were observed, both in PLRs who had OIC despite recent or ongoing laxative use and in non-PLRs with no recent history of laxative use prior to screening, starting at week 1 and were maintained at each week of the treatment period. Response in the PLR group is clinically important, as these patients had already failed the traditional first-line therapy and with naldemedine they have an efficacious and safe alternative treatment option.Comparison between PLR and non-PLR subgroupsThe proportion of responders to naldemedine was slightly but significantly higher in the non-PLR subgroup than in the PLR subgroup, although this finding should be interpreted with caution because the analysis did not include a placebo comparator. No other significant differences in efficacy outcomes were observed between the PLR and non-PLR subgroups in patients treated with naldemedine. We hypothesized that PLRs represent a subgroup of patients that are less compliant or that have pre-existing comorbidities, such as defecation disorders, that may make them less responsive to medications for constipation in general. Although the results of this analysis do not support our hypothesis, the lack of a pronounced difference between the PLR and non-PLR subgroups is not unexpected given that PAMORAs such as naldemedine act directly in the GI tract by reversing the effect of opioids on µ-opioid receptors.19 Laxatives, by contrast, do not address the underlying pathophysiology of OIC.19The presence and severity of OIC symptoms at baseline were generally similar between PLR and non-PLR subgroups. It is also notable that PLR and non-PLR subgroups received the same ranges of opioid doses, underscoring the fact that even low-dose/weak opioids may result in OIC.20,25 On the primary efficacy endpoint, the placebo response rate appeared somewhat lower in the PLR subgroup (30.2%) than in the non-PLR subgroup (38.9%). This observation of a lower placebo response may be indicative of a slightly less responsive population, although the difference may have been due to chance.Adverse eventsNaldemedine 0.2 mg treatment once daily was generally well tolerated for up to 12 weeks in both the PLR and non-PLR subgroups, with the most common TEAEs in both subgroups being GI related. This latter observation is consistent with the mechanism of action of naldemedine.17,19 The incidences of treatment-related TEAEs and adverse events leading to discontinuation were significantly higher among naldemedine-treated patients versus those receiving placebo in the non-PLR subgroup but not in the PLR subgroup, although the PLR and non-PLR subgroups treated with naldemedine showed similar rates of treatment-related TEAEs (22.2% and 19.1%, respectively) and adverse events leading to discontinuation (4.8% and 5.5%, respectively).Definition of PLRThe definition of PLR varies across studies of patients with non-cancer pain and OIC, making comparisons difficult. A prospective study of patients treated with naloxegol prespecified the definition of PLR as those who took medication from one or more laxative classes for a minimum of 4 days within 2 weeks before screening and whose symptoms were rated as moderate, severe, or very severe in at least one of four stool symptom domains on the baseline laxative-response questionnaire.26,27 In contrast, a retrospective study examining characteristics of patients with non-cancer pain and OIC defined PLR as those who had <3 bowel movements and ⩾1 symptom from the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms questionnaire scored moderate, severe, or very severe, despite sufficient laxative use (at least one laxative agent on ⩾4 occasions during a 2-week period).14 Development of a standard definition for PLR is further complicated by the fact that many patients express satisfaction and willingness to continue laxative therapy despite experiencing no or minimal relief of symptoms.28 Nonetheless, response rates in the above mentioned naloxegol study were consistent with the results reported here, with comparable response rates in patients with PLR and in the overall population.LimitationsA limitation of this current analysis is that it was a post hoc analysis of integrated data from the COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2 studies. PLR and non-PLR were also defined post hoc. In the current analysis, patients were either poor responders to prior laxative therapy or did not have a recent history of poor response to laxative therapy. All patients had prior exposure to laxatives based on selection criteria. However, it is unclear why the non-PLR group had not been taking laxatives despite having clear signs of OIC (e.g., for financial reasons, whether they had not found laxatives to be successful or satisfying in the past, or whether they were concerned about the potential harms of long-term laxative treatment). Thus, the non-PLR group may have comprised patients with a range of responsiveness to laxatives. Another limitation of the analysis is that comparisons between PLR and non-PLR subgroups did not control for placebo effects. Additionally, as rescue laxatives were allowed if a patient had not had a bowel movement for 72 h, differences between PLR and non-PLR subgroups in the response to rescue laxatives may have confounded results of this analysis.ConclusionData from this integrated analysis further support the efficacy and tolerability of naldemedine in the treatment of OIC and demonstrate that naldemedine has a consistent effect regardless of whether or not a patient had a poor response to laxatives.AcknowledgmentsEditorial and writing support was provided by Adrienne Drinkwater of Peloton Advantage, LLC, an OPEN Health company, and funded by Shionogi Inc.Conflict of interest statementMH was a clinical trial investigator, consultant to Shionogi Inc. and received a stipend for review of the clinical study report.JW received a stipend from Shionogi Inc. for review of the clinical study report.T Yamada is an employee of Shionogi Inc. who may or may not own stock options.T Yokota is an employee of Shionogi & Co., Ltd. who may or may not own stock options.JT has provided scientific advice to Allergan, Kyowa Kirin, Shionogi, and Shire, has been a speaker for Allergan and Kyowa Kirin, and has received a research grant from Kyowa Kirin related to opioid-induced constipation.VA has received speaker and/or consultant fees from Allergan, Bayer, Falk, Ferring, Hexal, Kyowa Kirin, 4M-Medical, Sanofi, and Shionogi.AMD has no conflicts to decl",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Friends Read FreeRudy Lienau attends Shen Yun Performing Arts in Madison. (Valerie Avore/The Epoch Times)By Epoch Times Staff4/5/2012Updated: 8/14/2015PrintMADISON, Wis.—“This show is totally impressive and gives me great respect for Chinese culture. I wish I knew more,” said Steve Holtzman about Shen Yun Performing Arts Touring Company appearing at the Overture Center for the Arts. Mr. Holtzman saw the performance on Thursday night, April 5. Mr. Holtzman’s response is exactly what Shen Yun hopes to achieve, to bring the best of 5,000 years of Chinese culture wherever it tours, and to have audiences gain a new appreciation for this traditional culture. Now retired, Mr. Holtzman, a Madison alderman and a salesman, worked for ELF Technologies. He also served on the Madison Common Council, and on the board of TAPIT/new works Ensemble Theater.“It’s really remarkable that people can perform at such a level,” Mr. Holtzman said of the quality of the performance. Especially intriguing to him was the company’s orchestra, comprised of both Western and Chinese instruments: “It was also interesting to see the way there’s a mix of classical [Western] instruments and the classical Chinese—there’s three classical Chinese instruments right in the center. They’re very prominently featured. “It’s great to hear those instruments in a hall where I usually hear classical [Western] music—to hear them working with the other classical performers ... In fact, that’s one of the reasons I stayed on the side ... because I got a good set line right down to them.” Although Mr. Holtzman is not a musician, his parents taught him to love music. “Those three performers—there’s a flute player, and two-string instruments—they’re just fabulous performers. I’ve never seen those instruments played before.” For Shen Yun itself, Mr. Holtzman expressed his gratitude, “Thanks for coming to Madison.” Reporting by Valerie Avore and Sharon Kilarski. Shen Yun Performing Arts, based in New York, has three touring companies that perform simultaneously around the world, with a mission to revive traditional Chinese culture. Shen Yun Performing Arts Touring Company will next perform in Calgary, Canada, April 8-9.

(Florida Department of Law Enforcement via Getty Images)By Kos Temenes2/11/2024Updated: 2/12/2024PrintX 10:00Mark Epstein, the brother of convicted child sex predator Jeffrey Epstein, described in a recent interview how he went from initially accepting the official ruling that his brother’s death was a suicide to questioning the case of death.Epstein’s body was discovered in his jail cell in August 2019 after he reportedly hanged himself while awaiting trial.Mark Epstein remarked during an interview on Feb. 9 that photographs taken of Epstein following his death could contradict the official narrative of suicide by hanging.The remarks came during an interview with SiriusXM host Megyn Kelly. New York City’s chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, determined at the time that Epstein had committed suicide in his jail cell.Although a forensic pathologist hired by the family of the disgraced billionaire and trafficker questioned that initial ruling, Dr. Sampson stood firmly behind her conclusion, which Mr. Mark Epstein said he had no reason to doubt initially, despite the pathologist’s objection.“I had no reason to doubt it. He didn’t have any children. Our parents are gone. He would know he didn’t have to worry about me. … so, I respected that as his decision,” Mr. Mark Epstein said during the interview.Related StoriesThe Sinister Links Between Jeffrey Epstein, CBDCs, and Bitcoin1/23/2024Cameron Diaz Denies Any Association With Jeffrey Epstein1/8/2024However, he went on to say that upon meeting with medical examiners in New York City at the time, he was informed that his brother’s death could not be called a suicide “because it looked too much like a homicide.”“So then the questions became if he didn’t commit suicide, then he was killed, and then who killed him? How was it done?” Mr. Mark Epstein continued before presenting photos of his brother’s autopsy.Ms. Kelly also said she failed to see how the marks on Epstein’s neck—which looked more like a wire or thin rope had been used to strangle him, as opposed to marks from the alleged bed sheet that was reported to be used in the alleged suicide—could match what was conveyed in the official narrative.“I have a hard time, as a layperson, understanding how a sheet made that mark,“ Ms. Kelly said after being presented with the photos. ”It’s almost like garrote was used or some sort of rope wire.”During the interview, Mr. Mark Epstein also pointed out several other inconsistencies, such as the reported malfunction of the security camera outside Epstein’s cell, Epstein’s body having been moved after he was found dead, and Mr. Mark Epstein’s inability to get answers from the government.The Epstein bothers had been largely estranged since the death of their mother about 15 years ago, only speaking on rare occasions. According to an article published by the Guardian last month, Jeffrey Epstein did not expect to be arrested in 2019, as he believed he was protected under a plea deal 12 years prior, which had granted him immunity. He was found dead in his jail cell less than a month later.Mark Epstein said afterward that he was not satisfied with the official conclusion about his brother’s death and added that he would like the case to be reinvestigated.Recently released documents showed multiple high-profile individuals on Jeffrey Epstein’s flight log of his private jet, including billionaire and Microsoft founder Bill Gates and former U.S. President Bill Clinton.Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the photographs constitute new evidence.

We examined interviews from 13 identified positive deviants living with four different stigmatized health conditions (HIV, leprosy, schizophrenia, and diabetes) in Indonesia. Positive deviance develops in the form of psychological empowerment through improvement of self-belief and perception (intrapersonal component), development of understanding and skill to exert control in life (interactional component), and self-discovery of successful behaviors and strategies to avert stigma (behavioral component). Positive deviants, after being empowered, start empowering others affected by sharing their knowledge and fostering social awareness and acceptance. The findings revealed the presence of problem-solving ability and agency within the community of stigmatized individuals in Indonesia and warrant researchers to partner with the community to expedite the diffusion of transferable positive deviant strategies within and outside the communities.IntroductionPositive deviance is an approach that seeks to solve complex societal problems by uncovering solutions that already exist in the society (Bradley et al., 2009; Marsh et al., 2004). The approach entails identifying individuals called “positive deviants” within the society who have managed to overcome a commonly shared problem by devising their own unique techniques and mechanisms using readily available resources within the community and then learning and replicating those successful strategies to help others in the community (Marsh et al., 2004; Pascale & Monique, 2010). As these unique traits and strategies are derived within the community using resources that are available to all, this approach ensures easy diffusion, uptake, and sustenance of solutions in the community (Marsh et al., 2004; Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010). Studies have highlighted this very scope of positive deviance as an approach to discovering solutions to avert existing health-related adversities in the community (Bradley et al., 2009; Marsh et al., 2004). To date, positive deviance has proven as an effective approach to tackling some of society’s complex health-related problems from child malnutrition (Marsh et al., 2004), smoking cessation (Awofeso et al., 2008), weight loss/control (Stuckey et al., 2011), retention in medical treatment (Assefa et al., 2014), to post-traumatic stress disorder from sexual abuse (Herlof Andersen, 2008).The positive deviance approach may hold promise in addressing the widely prevalent and complex issue of health-related stigma in the society. Weiss et al. (2006) define health-related stigma as “a social process that instigates devaluation, exclusion and rejection of people based on their health condition.” The experience of health-related stigma among people living with health conditions is broadly categorized into two—enacted and felt stigma. Enacted stigma entails the experience of negative social judgment and discrimination, while felt stigma entails internalized shame associated with having a health condition and fear of experiencing discriminatory acts (Lekas et al., 2011; Scambler, 2004). Health-related stigma is a persistent problem in many communities around the world (Kemp et al., 2019; Sercu & Bracke, 2017; Stangl et al., 2019; Woodgate et al., 2020) and is known to negatively affect the quality of life of people living with stigmatized health conditions (Holzemer et al., 2009; Mosanya et al., 2013; Tsutsumi et al., 2007) and hamper the treatment and management of their disease (Sercu & Bracke, 2017; Stangl et al., 2019). Studies have shown that health-related stigma, particularly felt stigma, can be improved through various stigma reduction strategies and interventions targeted towards people living with stigmatized conditions (Dadun et al., 2019; Lusli et al., 2016; Peters et al., 2016; Rao et al., 2019). For example, Dadun et al. (2019) and Lusli et al. (2016) reported significant reduction in felt stigma among people with leprosy in Indonesia through socio-economic and rights-based counseling interventions respectively. However, existing interventions as such are often cost-intensive and non-sustainable in the long run (Kemp et al., 2019). Many of such stigma reduction interventions involve solutions that reside outside the community, which include resources and practices that require heavy investments and adopter buy-ins, and are often managed by external agents with minimal to non-existent involvement of the community (Kemp et al., 2019; Singhal et al., 2010). Studies have shown that community-based interventions that focus on locally derived and -led solutions can be effective (Bogart & Uyeda, 2009), have greater uptake (Seyfang & Smith, 2007), and likely to be sustainable in the long run (McLeroy et al., 2003).The concept of positive deviance has prospects in uncovering sustainable and effective solutions to stigma reduction that are self-derived and already exist within the community, ensuring maximal community uptake and ownership. People living with stigmatized health conditions have their own personal agency, and some succeed to overcome stigma in their lives through such self-derived internal mechanisms and strategies (Peters et al., 2014; Shih, 2004). Insights from the life experiences of these positive deviants can help disentangle the unique mechanisms and strategies used by them to mitigate their negative experiences of stigma and help deconstruct their successful approaches to identify those that can be transferred, practiced, and embedded within the community to help others. Understanding positive deviance can not only help uncover and improve understanding on the mechanism of self-agency, but also help in identification of effective, innovative, and sustainable solutions for stigma reduction that may already exist in the community. However, this has, to our knowledge, not been done yet, and still remains an underdeveloped and underexplored area of research.Therefore, we aimed to explore and understand the process of development of positive deviance to overcome stigma among people living with four distinct health conditions—HIV, leprosy, schizophrenia, and diabetes—in Indonesia. The context of Indonesia as a developing upper-middle income country with high burden of both communicable and non-communicable diseases provides an ideal prospect for this study (IHME, 2010; Kemp et al., 2019; Stangl et al., 2019). Studies have found that Indonesia not only has high burden of infectious diseases, particularly HIV (UNAIDS, 2017) and leprosy (WHO, 2017), and non-communicable mental illness like schizophrenia (HRW, 2016) or a chronic metabolic disorder like diabetes (IDF, 2017), but also rampant stigma and discrimination associated with these four health conditions (Lusli et al., 2016; Pujilestari et al., 2014; Rai et al., 2020; Subu, 2015; Sianturi et al., 2019). Further, studies have indicated that while the cause/origin and severity of stigma may differ across different health conditions, the experience of stigma and their consequences remain largely similar (Rai et al., 2020; Rao et al., 2019; Van Brakel et al., 2019). Taking into consideration such similarities that exist in stigma experiences across different health conditions, we sought to explore the pathway in which people living with one of these four stigmatized diseases in Indonesia develop positive deviance to overcome stigma.Positive deviance approach for social change“Positive deviance (PD) is an approach to social change that enables communities to discover the wisdom they already have, and then to act on it” (Pascale & Monique, 2010).The positive deviance approach strives for sustainable behavioral and social change through identification of solutions that are community-derived, diffused and owned (Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010; Van Dick & Scheffel, 2015). There are many methodologies for the positive deviance approach (Marsh et al., 2004; Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010; Pascale & Monique, 2010). Nonetheless, the characteristics of the different methodologies are very similar. All methodologies acknowledge the importance of identifying the needs of the community, the problem, and the positive deviants. Furthermore, all methods try to discover successful behaviors and/or practices of the positive deviants; this is often called the positive deviance inquiry (Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010). The only difference exists in the final stage of the process, where the steps can lead to either monitoring and evaluation (Marsh et al., 2004; Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010) or continuous research on the positive deviants within a community and extend the positive deviance research to other communities (Fowles, 2007).One of the widely used methodologies is the one proposed by the Positive Deviance Initiative (Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010). This methodology consists of five basic steps, namely, (i) defining the problem; (ii) determining the presence of positive deviants (usually four to six people, as they are rare); (ii) discovering successful behavior that offers solution to the problem; (iv) designing activities using the discovered solution; and (v) monitoring and evaluation. The first four steps are also known as the four Ds (Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010). Within the scope of this study, only the four Ds of the positive deviance methodology were utilized, with focus on assimilating the findings and recommending subsequent actions for the fourth D instead of designing activities.MethodsStudy Settings and ProcedureThis study was a part of an exploratory community-based study on health-related stigma conducted in Jakarta and west Java in Indonesia between March and June 2018 among people with/affected by either of the four stigmatized health conditions—HIV, leprosy, schizophrenia, and diabetes. This study comprised of an exploratory qualitative design to understand the process of development of positive deviance. These four specific health conditions were chosen because of their higher prevalence (MOH, 2013; IDF, 2017; UNAIDS, 2017; WHO, 2017) in comparison to other south-east Asian nations and stigmatization in the Indonesian society (Lusli et al., 2016; Peters et al., 2013; Pujilestari et al., 2014; Subu, 2015; Sianturi et al., 2019). Participants were recruited purposively from the community through referrals from community-based organizations and peer-support groups. Those who were over the age of 16 (age of consent) and who were willing and consented to participate were included in the study. This study was based on in-depth interviews.Selection of Positive DeviantsA multi-stakeholder consultation with local researchers, community leaders, peer leaders, and representatives of community-based organizations was undertaken to identify positive deviants across the four conditions. The role of the stakeholders in this study was limited to the identification, selection, and recruitment of the participants. As per the consultation, a four criteria definition for positive deviants was derived. Positive deviants were those who (i) successfully managed to overcome stigma in their lives, (ii) were not ashamed of their disease, (iii) innovated unique mechanisms and ways to avert stigma, and (iv) managed to reintegrate into the society. A two-step identification and recruitment of positive deviants was then conducted. In the first step, 21 individuals (HIV: 6; leprosy: 6; schizophrenia: 5; diabetes: 4) were identified through referrals from local resource persons. This took place in different ways for each condition: possible positive deviants with leprosy were identified in Cirebon through recommendations from peers and resource persons from local leprosy-related organization, those with HIV and schizophrenia were identified through peers and community-based organizations in Jakarta, and those with diabetes were recruited through peer-recommendation and patient support groups in Jakarta. In the second step, the identified positive deviants were further confirmed through preliminary in-depth interviews using the aforementioned criteria. Based on the interviews, 13 positive deviants were finally selected (HIV: 4; leprosy: 3; schizophrenia: 4; diabetes: 2). A final consultation was conducted among the research team and community stakeholders for consensus on the selection of positive deviants.Data CollectionQualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with identified positive deviants. Informed consent was sought prior to participation in the study. Those who agreed were either interviewed in their homes or at the NGO offices in privacy. Prior to interview, sociodemographic information on age, gender, ethnicity, religion, income, etc. was collected from the participants. The interviews started in an exploratory manner and progressed toward more in-depth questions to uncover the participants’ self-reported trajectory/process of positive deviance. On average, the interviews lasted an hour. During the interviews, a guide was used (Supplementary File 1). The following topics were addressed by the interview guide to uncover the development of positive deviance: general information, life history, experience of living with the health condition, experience of stigma and discrimination, turning point in life, strategies used to avert stigma, perceived changes after overcoming stigma, and current works and activities. Focused probing was conducted to discover successful strategies and behavior employed by participants to mitigate stigma in their lives. The interviews included exhaustive probing along with member check/respondent validation to ensure trustworthiness of the collected data. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Data management and analysis were performed using Atlast.ti software.Data AnalysisData analysis was independently carried out by the two co-authors—one from the field of global health (Sarju Sing Rai) and other from psychology (Elena Syurina). The obtained codes were discussed among the authors: common codes were combined, while the different and discrepant codes were further deliberated on and noted. All such codes/categories were discussed with and agreed upon by all co-authors in each stage of the analysis to make final decisions on the codes/categories. The constructivist grounded theory approach outlined by Charmaz (Charmaz, 2014) was used for data analysis. Using Charmaz’s approach, data analysis entailed an extensive process of coding and memo writing. The analysis was conducted as follows:Initial CodingThe transcripts were read line-by-line and incident-by-incident coding was conducted within each interview to obtain the initial codes.Focused CodingAfter obtaining the initial codes, they were compared across the interviews from all positive deviants. Codes were first clustered into categories based on the two preliminary evolving themes that emerged from analysis—development of positive deviance and impact of positive deviance. As the coding process proceeded, it became clear that some of the categories corresponded to most positive deviants, which became the main theoretical categories. There were some categories that were less mentioned and formed sub-categories. The codes were then categorized and preliminary categories were obtained.Theoretical CodingIn the theoretical coding process, the categories obtained through focused coding from all 13 interviews were further studied, compared, and organized. The process entailed interlinking and synthesizing of those categories that led to integration of interrelated categories into themes. Three main themes emerged from theoretical coding, viz. “triggers” that led to positive deviance, “empowerment” as an actual process of positive deviance, and “impact” of positive deviance. Under each theme were interrelated categories and sub-categories. The process of theoretical coding led to a preliminary theoretical framework obtained through assimilation and thematic conceptualization of interrelated categories.Application of Extant Theoretical ModelsAs per the constructivist grounded theory approach, the resultant theoretical concepts were compared with existing relevant literature in the later stage of data analysis. The theoretical categories pertaining to the theme “empowerment” was found to bear strong similarity to the existing theoretical models of psychological empowerment. Upon further review and comparison, the authors deemed fit to integrate the theoretical concept of “empowerment” into the existing theoretical model of psychological empowerment by Zimmerman (Zimmerman, 1995).Zimmerman’s psychological empowerment model (Zimmerman, 1995) was used to describe the process of development of positive deviance. The model posits that psychological empowerment entails three components, viz. intrapersonal, interactional, and behavioral component, which all work together in unison to empower an individual. The first component—intrapersonal empowerment—refers to how individuals think about themselves and perceive control, self-efficacy, and motivation in their lives. This component is about the individual’s perception of self-esteem, self-view, and locus of control. The second component—interactional empowerment—refers to the critical awareness and understanding people have about their condition, community, and society (norms, structures, etc.), and the ability and skillset individuals have to make a change. This component posits that individuals need to learn about their options and scenario in a given context in order to be able to exert control in their environment. The final component—behavioral empowerment—occurs when individuals have both intrapersonal and interactional empowerment to drive a positive behavior change. Behavioral empowerment refers to actual actions/behaviors/strategies undertaken to make a change and directly influence outcomes in one’s life (Zimmerman, 1995).Memo WritingMemo writing was a crucial part of the entire data analysis process as outlined by Charmaz (Charmaz, 2014). The authors wrote down memos on the evolving codes and resultant categories and themes in every step of the analysis. The memos helped in thorough reflection, comparison, and elucidation of the emerging codes and categories and guided the whole analytical process.Final Theoretical FrameworkA final theoretical framework of the process of development of positive deviance was obtained after integration of the main themes with the extant theoretical model. The final theoretical model includes four thematic stages that underline the process of development of positive deviance among the participants.Rigor of StudyThe analytical process was peer debriefed and discussed in each stage to ensure the quality and trustworthiness of codes, categories, and themes. The authors made sure all codes, categories, and themes were obtained until the point of saturation. The results of the analysis were carefully reviewed and refined in all stages. Rigorous vetting and deliberation were carried out among the authors in determining the causal and consequential relationships between the categories and developing the preliminary theoretical framework from thematic coding, and then integrating the theoretical concepts into existing theoretical models after literature review. The final framework was thus obtained after consensus from all authors on the final themes and the logical connection and pathway they describe. An outline of the analytical process and resultant outcomes in each stage of analysis is presented in Supplementary File 2.Ethical ApprovalThis study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of Atma Jaya Catholic University, Indonesia (Approval ID: FR-UAJ-26-13/R0). All participants provided verbal and written consent to participate in the study.ResultsDemographic Information About ParticipantsA total of 13 individuals were identified as positive deviants. Out of them, four were living with HIV, three were affected by leprosy (two with visible physical impairments), four with schizophrenia, and two with diabetes (with no diabetic complications and resulting impairments). There were six male and female respondents, while one identified as transgender. The majority of the respondents belonged to Jawa and Sunda ethnicity (67.6%), and followed Islam (69.2%). The median age of the positive deviants was 41.31 years (SD 14.22) with an age range between 20 and 75. The mean duration of living with/having had the condition was 12.31 years (SD 5.99) with a range between 1 and 25 years.The Process of Development of Positive DevianceThe final theoretical framework obtained from the constructivist grounded theory analysis described four stages of the process of development of positive deviance among the participants: (i) initiation, where specific triggers helped initiate the process of psychological empowerment among positive deviants, (ii) self-strengthening, where the process of psychological empowerment repeated in a loop while further strengthening its components, (iii) impact, where after being empowered, positive deviants started helping others and contributing to the society, and (iv) reinforcement, where the process of impact and psychological empowerment repeated in a reiterative cycle, enriching each other in every iteration. The framework illustrating the four stages of development of positive deviance is outlined in Figure 1.Figure 1. The process of development of positive deviance.InitiationTheoretical coding showed that participants developed positive deviance through psychological empowerment. The process of psychological empowerment adapted from Zimmerman’s model (1995) constituted three components:a. Intrapersonal component: Positive deviants reported of intrapersonal component of psychological empowerment that helped them improve their self-belief and perception and led them to take charge of their lives. The categories of intrapersonal component included: (1) “self-acceptance,” wherein positive deviants talked about how accepting themselves and their health condition was the first step to feeling better about themselves and improving self-esteem; (2) “self-confidence,” which played an important role for them to be self-aware of their ability to perceive control of their life; (3) “positive outlook,” wherein positive deviants reported of having positive insights and outlook to life, which ignited a sense of hopefulness and normalcy in their lives; and (4) “motivation,” which provided them the incentive to keep going on and striving for better.Motivation was further categorized into three sub-categories based on its sources: (i) “empathy towards other stigmatized individuals,” where motivation came from being able to relate to others living with the same health condition as them and having empathy towards them; (ii) “experience of stigma/discrimination,” wherein motivation came from the experience of stigma in their everyday life from family, friends, and healthcare professionals; and (iii) “concern for loved ones,” where motivation came from the concern that positive deviants had for their loved ones—especially close family members (children, spouse, father, mother, etc.).b. Interactional component: Positive deviants reported of interactional components that helped them develop critical awareness and understanding of their disease and the environment, and gain skills to manage stigma. This included (1) “experiential knowledge,” wherein positive deviants reported of how their personal experiences of living with the health condition provided a better understanding of not only their disease but also the context of stigma surrounding them; (2) “information,” wherein they talked about how gaining relevant knowledge and information, either from other experts or through information resources, helped them understand their disease and think of ways to manage them; (3) “situational assessment and awareness,” in which they talked about the importance of having a critical awareness of the environment and the social norms in one’s daily life, and understanding measures to fit-in as a way to avert stigmatization; (4) “disclosure considerations,” wherein they highlighted the importance of understanding the people, their beliefs and specific contexts before disclosing one’s health status to others; (5) “support from others,” where they talked about how perception of support from others, especially family and friends, provide positive reinforcement in their lives; and (6) “resource mobilization skills,” wherein positive deviants discussed how critical awareness of available resources or ways to accessing different resources is paramount to effective management of their life.c. Behavioral component: Behavioral component in this study entails successful behavior changes exhibited by the positive deviants to overcome stigma. Positive deviants reported of two different concepts of behavior change—“personal changes” that helped them in their everyday life to overcome stigma, and ‘transformational leadership’ in which they started helping others affected to fight against stigma.Personal changes included behaviors like (1) “self-care,” wherein positive deviants highlighted the importance of caring for themselves for not only effective management and treatment of their disease but also for overall well-being. Self-care entailed both physical/medical care (taking medications regularly, following through with health check-ups, etc.) and spiritual care (meditation, prayers, etc.); (2) “indifference to others’ stigmatizing views/behavior,” wherein they talked about how they ignored and did not care about what others thought of them or talked about them. By this point, they perceived enough control of their life and environment that the public views did not affect them; (3) “disclosure of one’s status,” wherein disclosure of their health status was a very important action for positive deviants, which they said not only helped them feel liberated from shame and stigma associated with their disease, but also helped garner support and understanding from others; (4) and “situational adjustments to assert control of the environment,” where they talked about how adjusting according to different contexts, cultures, and situations help them avert stigma and judgment in their daily lives. They highlighted the importance of critical awareness of the environment and norms in helping decide the required adjustments needed.Transformational leadership included behaviors like (1) “leading by example (being a role model),” wherein having understanding and empathy towards others living with their health conditions, positive deviants discussed how they started helping others by showcasing their own life experiences of living with the condition and mentoring and guiding them; (2) “helping and supporting peers,” where positive deviants actively helped others affected through actions like home visits to track their treatment, emotional support and counseling, connecting/referring them to relevant people within their network, lending money when in need, etc.; (3) “activism,” wherein they talked about their passion to fight for their rights and those of other people affected. They showed aversion to inequality and injustice and actively spoke against those, while demanding equality and justice; and (4) “advocacy,” wherein some positive deviants reported of going a step further ahead from activism towards advocacy where they systematically worked with different stakeholders on affecting policy changes to improve the condition of people living with the health condition as them.A summary of the categories of the three aforementioned components, their description, and illustrative quotes are provided in Supplementary File 3.Role of Triggers in Initiating Psychological EmpowermentPositive deviants were found to already have different levels of intrapersonal and interactional component, as they had already gone through various experiences and exposures in thei",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 lives to provide for these two components of empowerment. However, to initiate the process of psychological empowerment, the two components needed to lead to behavioral component (i.e. to initiate behavioral changes to avert stigma). For this to happen, a “trigger” was necessary, which the participants called “the turning point in their life.” Triggers were found to act like sparks that started the process of psychological empowerment by either driving interpersonal or interactional component that ultimately led to behavior change.For positive deviants who had adequate interactional component but lacked sufficient intrapersonal component, a trigger in the form of added motivation helped in initiating the empowerment process. The motivational trigger came in different forms. For some positive deviants, motivation came after remission of their disease or improvement of their health after treatment. For others, motivation took shape in the form of indignation and revolt against discrimination. One positive deviant living with HIV gave an account of how at first she was complacent and tolerated discrimination from others, but when it was directed to her loved ones—she revolted: “[…] as long as the discrimination was only directed to me... […] I just accepted it. But…when I saw people close to me getting discriminated against, I got angry. […] my husband needed to get operated and we got denied from hospital […]. I ended up getting really angry. I reported it to ministry of health and I took it to the media. I ended up meeting the president of the hospital because I also didn’t want it to get to the media. (Female, HIV)”In case of positive deviants with adequate intrapersonal component but not enough interactional component, a trigger in the form of information that built their knowledge and skill helped strengthen interactional empowerment to drive behavior change and initiate the process of positive deviance. Information received through internet, social media, friends, family, healthcare professionals, and other individuals living with the condition (peers) helped ignite their passion to make positive change(s) in their lives. One positive deviant living with HIV who was in prison when tested positive for HIV recounted his experience of how information helped trigger positive deviance in his life: “The information that I got inside (the prison) … about HIV was limited. […] So, I called my friends and told them about my status, wishing they could look for books [on HIV]. But it turns out there were none, it was not that easy. […] I could only look at it from google, but Information that I got were limited. I tried to look for more information…luckily, there was a doctor from America who was conducting research inside the prison, so he/she told us […] as long as you have HIV, you could get medication to treat HIV. Knowing that, I fought for my rights and started arguing why we needed to wait until our condition got worse, if we were ready! (Male, HIV)”Triggers initiated psychological empowerment in the lives of the respondents in different stages of their lives. Some positive deviants encountered triggers at the earliest point when they came to know of their disease status, while for some it took a longer time—until a specific event or experience drove them to make changes in their lives. Further, the strength of triggers also differed as per individuals. For some, triggers had to be strong and cathartic to catalyze positive change like a traumatic experience of discrimination, while for some, they were very mild and gentle, much like an epiphany.Self-StrengtheningOnce initiated, the process of psychological empowerment was found to strengthen further by functioning in a reiterative loop, with each empowerment component leading to strengthening of either of the other two components, and so forth (see Figure1). One positive deviant with schizophrenia described this process which started with him recovering and feeling better and confident (intrapersonal empowerment), which led him to actively search for information and resources regarding his condition and learning ways to improve it (interactional empowerment), finally leading to making important changes in his life to improve his condition (behavioral empowerment): “I recovered (from schizophrenia) and I started looking more into what was I sick with. I looked it up (in google) and I learned that the symptoms matched with mine. But I did not stop there and started looking for more. I created my Facebook account […] and I found KPSI (NGO on Schizophrenia) and contacted them. After meeting others like me I was then sure that the pills really do help with our recovery. So, I regularly took my pill from 2010 until now. Thank God I haven’t relapsed since then. (Male, Schizophrenia).” Positive deviants, once entered into the process of psychological empowerment, were found to undergo the process reiteratively further building up on each of the three components that led to self-strengthening with time.ImpactWith initiation, development and strengthening of psychological empowerment, the positive deviants ultimately sought to bring about two distinctive impacts—directed toward others living with their health condition and toward the outside world. The first type was to strengthen and empower other stigmatized individuals from their group through “knowledge diffusion.” Positive deviants reported of how they were able to help others understand their disease and ways to manage it and avert stigma and other adversities in life. They talked about sharing with others the behaviors and strategies they used in their own lives, which helped them. One positive deviant with HIV talked about the advice he gives to others living with HIV: “I feel happy that I have been able to help others with HIV. I always tell them that accepting yourself first is the most important thing. If you can't accept yourself, how will others accept you. If you are able to accept yourself, others will follow. Even if others can’t accept you, at least you can accept yourself. (Male, HIV).”The second impact was to “foster wider social awareness and acceptance” of people living with the condition. Positive deviants talked about their yearning for acceptance and inclusion in the society, for which they made sure to portray a positive picture of how people with health conditions as them are just like any other person and are a productive member of the society. One positive deviant with HIV explained: “[…] I always try to show people that despite of having HIV, I am a productive person who contributes to the society. People will set aside the fact that you have HIV…. even if you’re gay and LGBT ….if they see you have skills and are productive. I taught in some government agencies and they don’t care that I have HIV, they just appreciate what can I give to the company. So that’s what I always emphasize “what can you give to other people?”. If you do good things, people will respect and appreciate you. (Male, HIV).”ReinforcementSuccessfully achieving impact was found to further encourage and reinforce the positive deviants’ psychological empowerment, which in turn encouraged them to strive for more impact—thus creating a reiterative positive loop between the process of psychological empowerment and the resultant impact (as illustrated in Figure 1). Positive deviants talked about how they felt more driven and motivated and strived to work harder to help others after seeing the positive impact they have been able to bring in the community and to people’s lives. One positive deviant with leprosy said in regards to helping others affected by leprosy: “When I saw how I was able to motivate other people with leprosy, I became even more motivated. I started learning new skills and working with other villagers to improve our village infrastructure. I showed everybody that even though I have leprosy, I can positively contribute to the society. Seeing my work, my friends with leprosy are even more motivated. … (Male, Leprosy).” Another positive deviant with HIV talked about how he managed to show the public that “people with HIV can equally contribute in the society” by teaching aerobics to the police, and reported receiving a lot of support from the public, which further fueled his desire to do more to improve their understanding and perception towards people living with HIV in the society.DiscussionThrough this study, we attempted to explore and understand the process of development of positive deviance among people living with stigmatized health conditions in Indonesia as a way to avert stigma. Positive deviants exhibited psychological empowerment triggered by their unique life events and experiences. Once initiated, the process of psychological empowerment was found to self-strengthen by functioning in a reiterative loop—with each empowerment component leading to strengthening of either of the other two components and so forth. With initiation and self-strengthening of psychological empowerment, the ultimate impact that the positive deviants were trying to bring about were empowerment of other stigmatized individuals from their group through diffusion of successful strategies in the community and striving for social change by fostering wider social awareness and acceptance of people living with the condition. The processes of impact and psychological empowerment were found to repeat in a reiterative cycle, enriching and building upon each other in every iteration.Positive deviance developed in the form of psychological empowerment which helped individuals overcome the experiences of stigma and related adversities in everyday life. Depending on the field of research and the setting, positive deviance can take different forms (Herlof Andersen, 2008; Marsh et al., 2004). Among Vietnamese farmers facing the issue of child malnutrition, positive deviance came in the form of going against the community tradition and diversifying the children’s diet to include other macronutrients other than just carbohydrates (Marsh et al., 2004). For men dealing with childhood experience of sexual abuse, positive deviance took shape in the form of focusing and building on a positive identity that identifies less with the experience of abuse (Herlof Andersen, 2008). In this study, psychological empowerment was indicative of positive deviants’ ability to perceive control in their life (interpersonal empowerment) and develop understanding of the social contexts and systems and ways to maneuver them (interactional empowerment), which enabled them to exert required actions to bring about positive changes in their lives that helped them overcome stigma and related adversities (behavioral empowerment) (Zimmerman, 1995).Further, once the process was initiated, the three components of psychological empowerment reiteratively self-strengthened each other while also leading the positive deviants to make an impact by empowering others and fostering public awareness. This in turn further strengthened the process of psychological empowerment among positive deviants that again led to more impact—thus creating a positive reiterative loop. This is consistent with Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 2001) which posits that positive psychological processes often enhance and grow in each thought-action repertoire creating an upward spiral. Studies on positive psychology have demonstrated this particular phenomenon where positive processes like coping with adversities, psychological resilience, and emotional well-being keep building and growing in a cyclical manner with each positive thought-action repertoire (Aspinwall, 1998; Fredrickson & Joiner, 2002).The findings indicate that psychological empowerment can be an effective way to overcome stigma among people living with stigmatized health conditions. This corroborates with the works of Oyserman and Swim (2002) and Shih (2004) which posited that empowerment can help stigmatized individuals overcome adversities caused by stigma, build self-efficacy, and reject negative labels associated with their stigmatizing trait. This may be a possible mechanism that can lead to reduction of felt stigma. Hence, interventions focused on psychological empowerment may have prospects in stigma reduction among those living with different health conditions. However, there may be two different approaches to designing such interventions. The first approach is the conventional etic empowerment approach led by external agents (researchers, program managers, etc.) whereby specific interventions are designed and introduced targeting the different components of psychological empowerment (Chopra & Ford, 2005; Sadan, 1997). Studies have indicated that such interventions can be effective (Eisman et al., 2016; Peterson & Reid, 2003). Eisman et al. found that targeting the three empowerment components not only improved the overall psychological empowerment, but also increased the likelihood of positive behaviors among youth (Eisman et al., 2016). Further there have been stigma reduction interventions focused on empowering people living with stigmatized health conditions, which have shown promising results in reducing felt-stigma (Dadun et al., 2019; Ebenso et al., 2007; Peters et al., 2016). However, studies have found that such interventions are often resource-intensive, have poor uptake by target beneficiaries, and not sustainable on the long run (Singhal et al., 2010; Singhal & Svenkerud, 2019; Stangl et al., 2019). This may not only have happened because of the obvious reason that the etic approach is often designed and led by external agents, but also because such interventions extensively focus on successful strategies which may work only in context of certain individuals and settings, and not the wider community.It is important to understand that for individuals like positive deviants, psychological empowerment is a self-derived mechanism, while for others, it might not be as obviously feasible. It can therefore be beneficial to follow a second approach—the positive deviance approach (Marsh et al., 2004; Positive Deviance Initiative, 2010; Pascale & Monique, 2010) that focuses in identifying the most usable and transferable behaviors or strategies employed by positive deviants that can be easily implemented, practiced, and shared by others in the community, which may help lead those who are not positive deviants into the path of psychological empowerment. For example, strategies such as selective disclosure of one’s health condition can be emulated by people living with stigmatized health conditions. As opposed to full disclosure, selective disclosure entails disclosing of one’s health condition to a selected group of people who the stigmatized individual trusts and/or expects understanding and support from (Corrigan & Rao, 2012). While this strategy may not help individuals fully mitigate stigma as feelings of shame and apprehension may still exist, it is known to provide a needed reprieve to stigmatized individuals by gaining supporters/confidants and getting a sense of control of how, when and who they disclose their health condition to (Black & Miles, 2002; Corrigan & Rao, 2012). This strategy has already proven effective among people living with HIV (Black & Miles, 2002; Kumar et al., 2015) and mental illness (Bos et al., 2009; Corrigan & Rao, 2012) in coping with stigma. Hence, such positive deviant strategies have prospects for broader acceptance, ownership, and practice in the community as they are derived from people from the community with similar experiences and contexts (Pascale & Monique, 2010). The positive deviance approach may thus have the answer to designing future stigma interventions that are not only effective but also sustainable.Positive deviants living with stigmatized conditions had passion and drive to help others in the community and yearned to make an impact among both other stigmatized peers and the society. Besides helping other stigmatized individuals, becoming role models, and advocating for their rights, they shared personal stories and specific strategies in their community. This may have already led to a diffusion of innovation (transference and transformation of tacit knowledge to implicit knowledge) within their community. Studies on psychological empowerment have shown that people who are empowered tend to empower others (Eisman et al., 2016; Sadan, 1997; Zimmerman, 1995). Eisman et al. (Eisman et al., 2016) found that psychological empowerment among youths in turn helped increase their prosocial involvement and contribution to the community. Positive deviants were further involved in advocacy to help other oppressed stigmatized individuals. This is consistent with the findings from Sadan (Sadan, 1997) who noticed that empowered individuals focused on advocacy to ensure even the weakest people can access empowerment process by creating the minimal environmental conditions.Further, they strived for social change and were known to put themselves out in the public eye to foster understanding and awareness of their condition. They aimed to elicit public understanding and empathy toward themselves and other people living with their condition—paving the way to social acceptance, reintegration, and possible inclusion. Sadan (Sadan, 1997) noted similar behavior among empowered people where empowerment extended beyond personal context like individual achievements—toward a path of social transformation. On discovering one’s right and ability to control one’s destiny, empowered individuals were known to systematically change their lives and environment, and consequently strive for social and political change (Wallerstein & Bernstein, 1994; Sadan, 1997).The findings from this study show prospects of the positive deviance approach to catalyze social change from within the community and provide comprehensive information on the “know-how” for those affected to empower themselves and overcome stigma and its negative effects. However, it is also important for the external agents and environment to also facilitate the process of social change. As per the social change theory it is important to influence both the normative and social structures in order to bring about social transformation (De La Sablonnière, 2017). The positive deviance approach is mostly focused in the normative level (Pascale & Monique, 2010; Singhal et al., 2010). While the approach may extend to exert influence on the social structural level (Marsh et al., 2004), the attempt may still fall short. In order to deal with a deeply rooted and complex issue of health-related stigma, it is important for allies from outside of the community to help in efforts to effect change in the social structural level (Singhal et al., 2010; De La Sablonnière, 2017; Singhal & Svenkerud, 2019).In this context, researchers, community leaders, and health program managers have an important role within the positive deviance approach that first and foremost includes understanding and acknowledging the existence of problem-solving ability and innovation within the community of stigmatized individuals. This is followed by partnering with the community members in identifying positive deviants and their successful strategies that can be used with ease within the community, and wider diffusion of those strategies. Researchers can help expedite this process of diffusion of innovation within the community. Further, researchers can play a very important role in the cross-diffusion of such successful strategies from one community to another, and subsequent participatory monitoring and evaluation of the process of social change. It is important for researchers and program managers to build an equitable alliance with the community members and support positive deviants as role models and leaders in the community. Further they can also play an important part in linking the community with other relevant stakeholders and advocacy partners to establish a united front to address both the normative and social structural level changes needed for stigma reduction in the society.This study also has certain limitations. While we uncovered how the process of self-strengthening and impact reiteratively reinforce each other, we could not determine the extent of the reiterations, specifically if such processes keep on building up throughout the whole life of the positive deviants or if they plateau at some point in life. Future studies should explore this further. Further, this study does not take into account the differences in the origin and severity of stigma across different health conditions, but rather focuses on the overall process of overcoming stigma. It is therefore important to take these unaccounted factors into consideration while formulating stigma reduction strategies based on the findings from this study. Despite the limitations, this study has several notable strengths. This study was able to identify 13 positive deviants through rigorous vetting. Marsh et al. (Marsh et al., 2004) have recommended a sample size of four to six participants in research involving the positive deviance approach owing to the rarity of positive deviants in the community. However, by partnering with the community stakeholders, we were able to identify and verify a much larger number of positive deviants than expected. To our knowledge, this was the first study to use the positive deviance approach to explore and understand how some individuals manage to overcome health-related stigma. Future studies should further expand on this approach by partnering with the community as an ally to design activities or interventions that can help other stigmatized individuals overcome stigma. Further, it is recommended that the positive deviant behavior and strategies identified in the study be utilized in stigma reduction interventions to assess its transferability, translationality, and effectiveness in non-positive deviants living with stigmatized health conditions.ConclusionThe positive deviance approach employed in this study to understand how positive deviants overcome stigma demonstrates the presence of problem-solving ability and agency within the community of stigmatized individuals in Indonesia. Positive deviance took shape in the form of psychological empowerment. The process of how positive deviance develops among people living with stigmatized health conditions and the successful behavior they employ to avert stigma in their lives may hold promise in helping others affected by stigmatized diseases in Indonesia in overcoming stigma and fostering social inclusion through the process of psychological empowerment. Positive deviants have been crucial in not only coming up with these unique solutions and strategies to avert stigma, but also diffusion of those through knowledge sharing and support to other stigmatized individuals. Further, they strive for social change by fostering awareness and relatedness, and changing the perception of the societies’ way of viewing people living with health conditions. Researchers can play an important role in this process by partnering with the community and helping expedite the process of diffusion of positive deviant strategies within and outside the communities.Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.FundingThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by Leprosy Research Initiative (LRI), 706.18.20.LRI; Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate (EMJD) Fellowship-Trans Global Health Consortium, 2013-0039.ORCID iDsSarju Sing Rai https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5914-1471Annisa Ika Putri https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4398-3567ReferencesAspinwall L.

On Sept. 18, 2013, Merco Press published an article about Colombia's refusal to trademark Escobar's name for instructive and recreational purposes; Escobar t-shirts have also become popular in the United States. (Raul Arboleda/AFP/Getty Images) By Epoch Times Staff9/18/2013Updated: 9/18/2013PrintNigeria: All Hats and No CattleNigerians and their penchant for big titles and empty displaysNigeria has sadly morphed into a nation where the type of treatment or amount of respect someone gets, from the populace, is related to whether the person has one or more titles attached to their names. ...There are some that feel unfulfilled if they have not acquired at least one title. They therefore give the pursuit and acquisition of a title an unbridled primacy in their quest for success in life. They are willing to get it at all costs – pay for it, bribe their way through, engage in corruption, make half-hearted donations to schools, churches or grease the palms of corrupt “royal fathers”. ...There is such thing as “high chiefs” in our midst. Someone joked that the concept of “high chiefs” began when some of the “chiefs” started feeling that some village royal fathers were cheapening the chieftaincy titles by conferring them on undeserving people. …Nigeria World Malaysia: ‘Stupid’ boy on his way to be a docBUTTERWORTH, Malaysia—He was only 13 when he went to work with a noodle seller here to help his family make ends meet.But the boy who was once called “stupid” never for a moment lost track of his ambition to be a doctor.Today, seven years after Chin Chi Sheuan started working at Tong Kok Hwa’s noodle stall at Chai Leng Park, he will be flying to Taiwan to enrol at the Chung Shan Medical Uni­versity to fulfil his long-cherished dream.However, it has not been smooth sailing for Chi Sheuan, who had to deal with the death of a beloved grandfather, a broken home, dividing time between his school and the stall, handling cranky customers and, above all, saving enough money to go to medical school.Tong, 41, felt his heart bleeding for the boy, whom he regarded as an adopted son.So, the noodle seller started his own fund-raising drive and every ringgit he collected from his customers on Sept 15 went towards making Chi Sheuan’s dream a reality. A customer who was touched by the boy’s plight paid RM18,000 for a bowl of noodle. And by the end of the day, the fund had swelled to RM30,000. ...The Star Columbia: Colombia denies registry of the ‘Escobar’ trademark to family membersColombia’s government has refused registration as a trademark of the full name “Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria” the country most notorious narcotics criminal. According to local news in Bogotá the application was filed by Maria Isabel Santos Cabalerro, Juana Manuela Marroquín Santos and Juan Sebastian Marroquín Santos, Escobar’s widow and children respectively who changed their names after settling in Argentina in the late 1990.The three had requested the international recognition of the trademark for the purposes of education, training and recreation.The Commission of Industry and Commerce refused to register a trademark which bears the name of ‘the most notorious drug lord in Colombia’s history’, adding it would be immoral and subvert public order’. It said the name Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria is associated with a dark period of violence in Colombia that claimed thousands of lives as he fought extradition to the United States.Merco Press Iran: ’Glitch' gave Iran social media accessSome Iranians thought a government ban had been lifted after they were able to access Twitter and Facebook on MondayIranians got direct access to Facebook and Twitter for the first time in four years because of a technical fault, an Iranian official has said, denying suggestions the government had lifted a ban on social media.On Monday evening, several Iranians said they gained access to their accounts without having to get round a government firewall, leading them to hope that authorities had relaxed a ban in place since anti-government protests in 2009, some of which were organised on social media. ...Al Jazeera Uzbekistan: Share your harvest with the khokim, or be an enemy of the stateAllamurat Ametov – a farmer from Karakalpakstan – refused to “donate” one ton of rice per hectare of his cultivated land to the regional khokim (administrator). He was sued and as a result his farm was taken away. The 28-year-old farmer from the Nukus region of Karakalpakstan, presently unemployed, says that he is very disappointed with the justice system in the country. “I have been filing complaints and petitions to all the levels of the justice system for the past four years – the attorney general, the national security services chair, the supreme court, the minister of justice, the prime minister … all to no avail,” says Mr. Ametov. UZ News Canada: Family outraged after Rehtaeh Parsons photo appears in dating ad on FacebookFacebook has apologized and banned a dating company from advertising on its website after an ad featured a photo of Rehtaeh Parsons, a Halifax teen who died in April after a suicide attempt.“This is an extremely unfortunate example of an advertiser scraping an image from the Internet and using it in their ad campaign,” Facebook said in a statement emailed to the Star. ...The ad featured a photo of Parsons with the caption: “Find Love in Canada! Meet Canadian girls and women for friendship, dating or relationships.” Ionechat.com could not immediately be reached for comment. ...Toronto StarA screenshot of the ad featuring Rehtaeh Parsons. UK: Senior police in ‘drunk tanks’ callPrivately-run “drunk tanks” should be considered to tackle alcohol-fuelled disorder, police chiefs have said.Under the idea, drunks who are a danger to themselves would be put in cells to sober up and then pay for their care.The Association of Chief Police Officers, which is launching a campaign on alcohol harm to coincide with university freshers’ season, said problem drinking was on the increase.The Police Federation said the plan was “neither a viable nor long-term” fix.Northamptonshire Chief Constable Adrian Lee, who leads on the issue of problem drinking for Acpo in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, told the BBC that police cells were not the best places for people who had got so drunk they were “incapable of looking after themselves”.Nor should the taxpayer have to pick up the bill for people’s drunkenness, he said. ...BBC Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowEpoch Times StaffAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesFani Willis’s Testy TestimonyFeb 16, 20242 Blockbuster Trump Hearings TodayFeb 15, 2024House Republicans Rejoice Over Mayorkas ImpeachmentFeb 14, 2024‘Never Trump’ Billionaires Back HaleyFeb 12, 2024Related TopicsCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

Methods: Several clinical pharmacists engaged in nutrition support therapy compiled a list of articles published in 2020 considered important to their clinical practice. The citation list was compiled into a single spreadsheet where the author participants were asked to assess whether the article was considered important to nutrition support pharmacy practice. A culled list of publications was then identified whereby at least 5 out of the 8 author participants considered the paper to be important. Guideline and consensus papers from professional organizations, important to practice but not ranked, were also included. Results: A total of 169 articles were identified; 5 from the primary literature were voted by the group to be of high importance. An additional 17 guidelines, position, recommendation, or consensus papers were also identified. The top-ranked articles from the primary literature were summarized and a narrative regarding its implications to pharmacy nutrition support practice were provided. Conclusion: We recommend that pharmacists engaged in nutrition support therapy be familiar with these articles as it pertains to their practice.Get full access to this articleView all access and purchase options for this article.Get AccessReferences1.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

She took the family dog to the home where St. Onge lived and saw the woman in her garage, waiving her hands for help.“I was so scared, but happy she was alive,” Dawn said.She went back and called 911 and sent her husband to cover the woman with a blanket before emergency service workers arrived on the scene.St. Onge’s daugher, Sandy Mitter, told a local paper that her mother slipped on Saturday night after she went out to eat dinner. She was not able to get up.“We think she laid there for two to two-and-a-half hours,” Mitter said. “She kept trying to yell for help and was banging on the wall for neighbors.”She described DiPietro as heroic. “Thank you so much,” she said. “You’re my hero.”“He saved her life, that’s for sure,” Mitter told the paper. “And I don’t even have the words to say how grateful we are.”DiPietro, who is in the fifth grade, said it’s “cool” to be considered a hero.

( Billie Weiss/Getty Images)By Jack Phillips9/24/2017Updated: 9/24/2017PrintA group of about 16 New England Patriots players knelt during the national anthem on Sunday, drawing a chorus of boos from the crowd.The Patriots were playing against the Houston Texans in Foxboro, Massachusetts.Tom Brady was notably standing during the anthem, interlocking arms with his teammates.Some fans reported that there were boos before and after the national anthem—a sign that they were directing their ire at the players.Meanwhile, almost the entire Pittsburgh Steelers team stayed in the locker room during the national anthem before their 1 p.m. ET kickoff against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field.“We’re not going to play politics,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said, as reported by ESPN. “We’re football players, we’re football coaches. We’re not participating in the anthem today—not to be disrespectful to the anthem, but to remove ourselves from the circumstance.”“People shouldn’t have to choose. If a guy wants to go about his normal business and participate in the anthem, he shouldn’t be forced to choose sides. If a guy feels the need to do something, he shouldn’t be separated from his teammate who chooses not to.”One player, Alejandro Villanueva, a veteran, stood for the national anthem outside the locker room tunnel.It comes after President Donald Trump slammed the NFL over the anthem protests, which were started last season by ex-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who said he did it as a protest against oppression toward people of color.“If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!” Trump tweeted Sunday morning. He added that “NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN.”“If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!” he also tweeted later on Saturday.

The fluorescein angiography showed no leakage, ruling out a diabetic macular edema. A treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab led to cystic changes resolution and visual acuity recovery.Conclusion:Intravitreal bevacizumab can be successfully employed for this complication of MIDD’s macular dystrophy.IntroductionMaternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) was first described in 19921,2 and represents only 0.5% to 2.8% of diabetic patients.3 MIDD is mainly caused by a point mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial DNA.2 A wide spectrum of disease manifestations has been described, as the mutation is responsible for both MIDD and MELAS syndromes (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes).The typical clinical constellation of MIDD consists of a maternally inherited deafness, an early adult-onset diabetes in the third or fourth decade and macular changes that simulate pattern dystrophy.3,4 Ophthalmologists should be aware of this condition as they can help other specialists to sharpen the diagnosis. The patient will benefit from a better management of his diabetes, as this kind exhibits a higher prevalence of kidney disease, requiring an early renal protection.5 Moreover, some medicaments commonly used in diabetic patients should be avoided: metformin worsens the risk of lactic acidosis and statins should be used with caution in patients with myopathy.4 MIDD patients can as well associate other comorbidities as cardiac conduction defects that need to be screened. Finally, all first-degree relatives should be screened for the mutation and counseled genetically.4 Hence the importance of a prompt and accurate diagnosis of this particular form of diabetes, where the ophthalmologist may play a major role.A lower incidence of diabetic retinopathy has been described in MIDD’s patients, compared to other common forms of diabetes.3,5 However, up to 86% of patients suffering from MIDD present retinal abnormalities described as a macular pattern dystrophy.3,6 According to De Laat et al.,7 this macular dystrophy is classified into four stages: in grade 1 fine pigment abnormalities are better detected with fundus autofluorescence or fluorescein angiography. Hence fundus autofluorescence can help the early detection and recognition of the macular dystrophy, as it shows a decreased autofluorescence in areas of atrophy and increased autofluorescence of the pale subretinal deposits, even in areas of the retina that appeared normal clinically.8 Grade 2 retinal dystrophy clearly shows pigmented deposits that tend to encircle the macula, and often the optic disc. Grade 3 disease is characterized by profound choriorretinal atrophy with foveal sparing. In grade 4, fovea is affected by atrophy.6,7Only two previous cases of macular cysts associated to MIDD’s maculopathy have been reported.7,9 The therapeutic approach of this uncommon or infra-diagnosed complication remains uncertain: topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment,7 topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, intravitreal triamcinolone and systemic immunosuppression have been employed.9Case descriptionA 49-year-old patient diagnosed with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) was cared for in our clinic for twenty years. The hyperpigmented perifoveal dots in both maculae, the late onset diabetes (diagnosed at age 29) and a neurosensory deafness since he was 20 years old, in association with a high penetrance of both diabetes and deafness in his maternal lineage (Figure 1) were reasons to suspect a maternally inherited diabetes and deafness. The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of mitochondrial DNA mutation 3243A>G in peripheral blood.Figure 1. Family pedigree showing the maternal inheritage of diabetes, hearing loss or retinal abnormalities. Note the index case is marked with an additional square.The patient attended regular follow-ups where a slow progression of his macular dystrophy was observed. The hyperpigmented perifoveal dots evolved to discontinuous, circumferentially oriented perifoveal atrophy. Finally the atrophy patches coalesced into a ring that spared the central fovea (Figure 2(a)). The presence of intrarretinal hemorrhages and some isolated hard exudates demonstrates a mild diabetic retinopathy, which was quiescent and required no treatment. Indeed, he had a poor metabolic control. Between 2001 and 2020 his HbA1c ranged from 8.2% to 12.6% despite being treated with insulin and committing to regular follow-ups with endocrinologists.Figure 2. (a) Coalescent chorioretinal atrophic patches can be observed circumferentially to the macula. The fovea is spared. The presence of intrarretinal hemorrhages demonstrates a mild diabetic retinopathy, (b) Fluorescein angiography of the right eye shows a window defect in the area of the atrophy, with areas of hyperfluorescence demarcating the RPE defects. No leakage is seen, and (c) Late phase of fluorescein angiography of the left eye.In a routine examination the patient complained from vision loss in his right eye. He had a visual acuity (VA) of 20/50 in his right eye and 20/25 in his left eye. At that moment his HbA1c value was 9.5%. On his right eye the OCT scan (Heidelberg Spectralis) revealed cystic macular changes and a retinal thickness of 452 µm (Figure 3(a)). Due to the exudative aspect of the cysts in the OCT scan and the presence of a mild diabetic retinopathy, we assumed it was a diabetic macular edema and we treated the cysts with an intravitreal loading dose of bevacizumab (three monthly injections). No fluorescein angiography was performed at that moment. At the next consultation, VA had improved to 20/20 in his right eye and the OCT showed an anatomical improvement with resolution of his intrarretinal cysts (Figure 3(b)).Figure 3. OCT scans (Heildeberg Spectralis): (a) cystic macular changes in the right eye (RE), left eye (LE) shows a normal foveal contour. (b) Resolution of the cysts in the RE after a loading dose of intravitreal bevacizumab, (c) recurrence of macular cysts on the RE, (d) resolution of the cysts after a single-dose of intravitreal bevacizumab, and (e) OCT scan at the last visit available showing a preserved foveal contour in both eyes. Some perifoveal outer retinal atrophy patches can be seen in all OCT scans.Four months later, he had a recurrence. The vision on his right eye dropped to 20/30 and the OCT revealed new intrarretinal cysts (Figure 3(c)). His HbA1c value was 9.7%. At that moment, we decided to perform a fluorescein angiography which showed no leakage, ruling out a diabetic macular edema (Figure 2(b) and (c)). Therefore, we suspected the presence of optically empty cystic spaces but, given the previously good response to anti-VEGF, we considered the use off-label of an anti-VEGF. The patient was properly informed, and he consented to the treatment. After a single-dose of intravitreal bevacizumab, his vision ameliorated to 20/25 and a resolution of the intrarretinal cysts was noticed in the OCT scan (Figure 3(d)).After 1 year follow-up, no new recurrence has been detected and his vision remains stable. At the last visit his visual acuity was 20/25 and the last OCT scan showed a preserved foveal contour (Figure 3(e)).DiscussionMaternally inherited diabetes and deafness is an uncommon entity. As ophthalmologist, we may observe pigmented dots that evolve to coalescent atrophic patches. Both photoreceptor outer segments and retinal pigment epithelium cells are involved in the pathogenesis of this retinal dystrophy.10However, few cases develop a cystoid macular edema.As far as we know, only two cases of macular cysts have been associated to MIDD maculopathy.7,9 De Laat et al. described a bilateral cystoid macular edema “without a clear underlying cause” in a 35-year-old MIDD patient that resolved after four-month of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment.7 Recently, Qian et al. reported a case of cystoid macular changes in a 30-year-old MIDD patient. In the fluorescein angiography cystic spaces did not show leakage, ruling out a possible macular edema. The cystic changes resolved after topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, oral prednisone and systemic immunosuppression. However, the cysts recurred when topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor was given as monotherapy, requiring the off-label use of an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide. The cysts remitted and haven’t recurred in the last 18 months.9 Both cases demonstrate the presence of optically empty cystic spaces in MIDD’s macular dystrophy.A lower incidence of diabetic retinopathy in maternally inherited diabetes and deafness has been described, and some authors even suggest that mitochondrial mutations may have a protective effect against diabetic retinopathy.3,5 However, in the current case, the patient showed a mild diabetic retinopathy and the cysts on the OCT scan had an exudative appearance. As any other diabetic patient, MIDD patients can develop diabetic macular edema. That’s why it is so important in these cases to perform a fluorescein angiography, which will help to distinguish diabetic macular edema from cystic macular changes.Nevertheless, the best treatment option for these cysts is still unclear. It is known that other retinal dystrophies may as well associate a cystic macular edema, as retinitis pigmentosa, enhanced S cone syndrome and X-linked retinoschisis. Its pathogenesis is still not well defined, and the first line treatment option in these patients is topical use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. It remains to be elucidated if it would be an adequate option in a MIDD’s maculopathy that develops cysts. Until now, the only case treated with topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors recurred when given in monotherapy and required the use of intravitreal triamcinolone.9The current case shows that cystic changes resolved after a pro re nata regimen of Bevacizumab, suggesting that VEGF may play a major role in the pathogenesis of these cysts. To our knowledge, this is the first case of MIDD’s macular dystrophy associated cystoid macular edema that has been successfully treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF. Probably, many cystoid macular changes in these patients remain undiagnosed, either because of a lack of diagnosis of this syndrome or due to a misdiagnosis as a regular diabetic macular edema. More cases need to be reported, which will allow further studies to take place, and will assess the clinical management of this uncommon complication.We would therefore like to emphasize the need of a correct identification of this syndrome. A high index of suspicion is needed: the maculopathy is very characteristic, almost pathognomonic in association with the typical clinical constellation,3 and it may help the ophthalmologist to diagnose this infrequent entity. These patients will benefit from a better management of his diabetes, an optimal treatment and the screening and prevention of other common complications as nephropathy and cardiac conduction defects. Moreover, genetic counsel can be offered to the patient’s relatives.ConclusionMaternally inherited diabetes and deafness often associates a macular dystrophy that may in some cases develop macular cysts. Fluorescein angiography allows the differential diagnosis between macular cysts and diabetic macular edema. Anti-VEGF therapy can be useful in the treatment of macular cysts associated to this dystrophy, as the current case shows. However, further investigations are needed in order to better understand its pathogenesis and the possible therapeutic approaches.Ethics approval and consent to participateThis study was approved by the institutional review board of La Ribera Hospital.Consent for treatmentThe patient consented to the treatment.Consent for publicationThe patient consented to participate and for publication.Declaration of conflicting interestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.FundingThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.ORCID iDsAmelia Marco-Campmany https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2396-0728Javier Navarrete-Sanchis https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4479-6341References1.

(AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo)By The Associated Press1/11/2016Updated: 1/11/2016PrintMEXICO CITY—Mexico began the process of extraditing drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman to the United States, two days after the famed fugitive was recaptured following a dramatic, months-long hunt featuring movies stars, sewer escapes and bloody shootouts.Officials warned that the process could take a long time as Guzman’s lawyers file legal appeals and maneuver to keep their client in Mexico, where he has already escaped from maximum security prisons twice.On Sunday, agents formally notified Guzman that he was wanted in the United States. In a statement, the Attorney General’s Office said Mexican agents assigned to the international police agency Interpol served two arrest warrants to the drug lord, who is being held at the Altiplano prison following his capture by Mexican marines on Friday.Guzman’s defense now has three days to present arguments against extradition and 20 days to present supporting evidence, beyond the plethora of other appeals they have already started filing.Guzman’s powerful Sinaloa cartel smuggles multi-ton shipments of cocaine and marijuana as well as manufacturing and transporting methamphetamines and heroin, mostly to the U.S. He is wanted in various U.S. states and his July escape deeply embarrassed the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto and strained ties between the countries.Guzman’s attorney Juan Pablo Badillo has said the defense has already filed six motions to challenge extradition requests.Badillo said that his client shouldn’t be extradited to the U.S. because “our country must respect national sovereignty, the sovereignty of its institutions to impart justice.”On Saturday, a Mexican federal law enforcement official said the quickest Guzman could be extradited would be six months, but even that is not likely because of the many appeals filed by his lawyers. He said that the appeals are usually turned down, but each one means a judge has to schedule a hearing.“That can take weeks or months, and that delays the extradition,” he said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. “We’ve had cases that take six years.”Mexico’s willingness to extradite Guzman is a sharp turnaround from the last time he was captured in 2014, when then-Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said the extradition would happen only after he finished his sentence in Mexico in “300 or 400 years.”Guzman was re-apprehended on Friday after a shootout between gunmen and Mexican marines at the home in Los Mochis, a seaside city in Guzman’s home state of Sinaloa. Five suspects were killed and six others arrested. One marine was injured.Mexican authorities say actor Sean Penn’s contacts with Guzman helped them track the fugitive down — even if he slipped away from an initial raid on the hideout where the Hollywood actor apparently met him.Penn’s article on Guzman was published late Saturday by Rolling Stone magazine, a day after the drug lord’s recapture. In it, Penn wrote of elaborate security precautions, but also said that as he flew to Mexico on Oct 2 for the meeting, “I see no spying eyes, but I assume they are there.”He was apparently right.A Mexican federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to comment on the issue, told the Associated Press the Penn interview led authorities to Guzman in the area of Tamazula, a rural part of Durango state.READ MORESean Penn’s Flattering Interview of ‘El Chapo’ Provokes MockeryDrug Lord ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán Located Thanks to Interview With Sean PennThey raided Guzman’s remote hideout a few days after the interview and narrowly missed capturing Guzman, whose July escape from Mexico’s top security prison — though a mile-long (1.5-kilometer) tunnel — had embarrassed President Enrique Pena Nieto and made his capture a national priority.Describing the capture, Attorney General Arely Gomez said that investigators had been aided in locating Guzman by documented contacts between his attorneys and “actors and producers” she said were interested in making a film about him, though she did not name them.Two months after that close call, marines finally caught him in a residential neighborhood of Los Mochis, where they'd been monitoring a suspected safe house. Guzman was able to escape via storm drains and exited a manhole in the street. But he was captured in a vehicle on the highway.In the interview in Rolling Stone, Guzman defends his work at the head of the world’s biggest drug trafficking organization, one blamed for thousands of killings. When asked if he is to blame for high addiction rates, he responds: “No, that is false, because the day I don’t exist, it’s not going to decrease in any way at all. Drug trafficking? That’s false.”READ MOREDrug Lord ‘El Chapo’ Captured, but Extradition Is Next ChallengePenn wrote that Guzman was interested in having a movie filmed on his life and wanted Mexican actress Kate del Castillo, who had portrayed a drug trafficker in a television series, involved in the project.“He was interested in seeing the story of his life told on film, but would entrust its telling only to Kate,” wrote Penn, who appears in a photo posted with the interview shaking hands with Guzman.Penn’s representatives have not commented on the claims by Mexican officials.

Sometimes, the mechanisms we develop to manage these feelings aren’t actually helpful to us and may cause strain in our relationships. Psychological projection is one example.It’s common, and you probably aren’t even aware you’re doing it. But if you learn how to recognize it in yourself and the people you’re close to, you can work to change your own behavior and protect yourself from it in others.What Is Psychological Projection?Psychological projection is a behavior known in psychology as a defense mechanism. It’s an unconscious way of coping with emotional conflict and discomfort, according to the American Psychological Association (APA).When someone engages in projection, they attribute their own behaviors, emotions, characteristics, or impulses to another person or group without realizing it. “Projection is when we take feelings that we might not want to acknowledge in ourselves, such as jealousy or anger, and we ‘project’ them onto someone else,” explains Kelsey M. Latimer, PhD, a clinical psychologist and registered nurse in Stuart, Florida.Projection doesn’t reflect anything that’s actually been said or done by whoever is on the receiving end. It’s about what the person doing the projecting is thinking and feeling about themselves. For example, someone worried about their job performance might become overly critical of a co-worker, explains Joel Frank, PsyD, a clinical psychologist and neuropsychologist based in Los Angeles. “In this case, projection is used to quell the person’s insecurities surrounding their performance by converting their worries into criticisms about others,” he says.Common Questions & AnswersWhat are examples of psychological projection?One example is feeling intense anger toward someone and, instead of discussing or expressing that anger, saying, “They hate me.” Another is cheating on a monogamous romantic partner while constantly accusing them of being a cheater.Is projection gaslighting?Being accused of something you didn’t do or of having feelings you don’t can feel like gaslighting. But projection is something people do without realizing it to protect themselves from bad feelings. According to the APA, gaslighting is a form of manipulation where one person causes another to doubt themselves or their reality to gain control.How can you tell if someone is projecting?It can be challenging to spot projecting, but there are signs, including being defensive, making unfounded accusations, and being overly critical. If someone is placing blame or accusations without proof and being very defensive when questioned about their behavior, they could be projecting.How do I know if I’m projecting?Most people don’t know when they’re projecting, but it is possible to become more aware of your behaviors. If you find yourself having a strong negative reaction to someone else, consider whether you recognize something you don’t like about yourself in them. You may want to explore these feelings in therapy.How do you fix psychological projection?You can stop yourself from engaging in projection by being open to exploring feelings and receiving feedback in a safe setting, usually in group or individual therapy. It can take time to recognize your behavior and learn new ways to cope.What Causes Psychological Projection?Projection arises as a way to manage uncomfortable emotions, thoughts, or impulses. People might use projection to avoid acknowledging them, or to process them from a safe distance.Dr. Latimer says it can happen when someone “sees parts of themselves in others that they cannot stand in themselves.”Projection is often tied to feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem, according to Dr. Frank. He explains that internal distress can overwhelm a person’s ability to cope, so they displace their discomfort onto others.What Are the Signs Someone Is Projecting onto YouThe signs of projection can look different coming from different people, according to Frank. But he says there are some common traits.Being Overly CriticalWhen someone is quick to point out other people’s flaws and shortcomings, it may be an attempt to quiet their own insecurities. Frank explains that someone’s worries about their own character or behavior can be converted into criticism of others.Making AccusationsHas someone accused you of something that seemed to come completely out of left field? It could actually be something they’ve done or thought about doing. Think about a cheating spouse who acts suspicious of their partner.DefensivenessPeople who engage in projection often don’t know they’re doing it. Mental health experts say they may deny their feelings or behavior if you confront them. They may question your motives and refuse to take responsibility for their role in the situation.How Projection Affects Your Health“Projection is one of many defense mechanisms that all healthy people will engage in every once in a while,” says Latimer. However, if someone uses it a lot, “It is likely going to lead to some rocky relationships,” she says.Projection can also be a sign of certain mental health issues. Research has linked projection and other defense mechanisms to depression and anxiety, and to borderline, narcissistic, and antisocial personality traits.“At times, with strong projection, we can feel or actually be out of touch with reality and genuine connection with ourselves and others,” says Leslie Dobson, PsyD, a clinical and forensic psychologist in Long Beach, California.How to Stop Projecting — and What to Do if Someone Is Projecting onto YouIf you’re the one engaging in projection, it is possible to stop, but you’ll need to be aware of your behavior first. This can come through therapy and by accepting feedback. “As people progress through therapy and more individuals point out when and how they use projection, they become more aware of the defense and can more quickly identify when using it,” says Frank.Think about your emotions and feelings towards others in different situations. When someone triggers a negative emotion in you, reflect instead of reacting. Is it really about them, or is something deeper going on inside you? Working with a therapist can help you learn different ways of coping.If you’re on the receiving end of projection, Frank suggests you remember that the criticism or accusation isn’t about you. Try engaging the other person in an open, honest conversation about the situation and your feelings.Dr. Dobson recommends confronting the projection directly. Say: “I believe you are saying this or feeling this, but it is not related to me. You may want to reflect on the strength of your emotions at this time and take some space.""It’s important that you not accept or internalize what the person doing the projecting is saying about you, says Latimer. Communication and setting boundaries can help protect you and the relationship.Resources We Trust: ProjectionIf being on the receiving end of projection is causing you distress, there are organizations and tools that can help.Favorite Groups for Awareness and SupportNational Domestic Violence HotlineThe National Domestic Violence Hotline provides access to support and tools for domestic violence survivors 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

(Supplied by Genkyo Team)By Alex Wu3/16/2022Updated: 3/16/2022PrintX 10:00With the Russia-Ukraine war still ongoing, volunteers from more than 52 countries have joined the Ukrainian international legion.A well-known Chinese writer and a critic of China’s ruling Chinese Communist Party told the Chinese language edition of The Epoch Times that he had applied to join the legion on March 10 and was leaving for Kyiv on March 14.Yi Qiwei shared his experience from volunteering in the Polish town of Medyka at the Ukrainian border while waiting to leave to Kyiv to join the fight.Yi Qiwei (a.k.a. Wu Dizhao), a descendant of a Manchu royal bannerman, published his first novel “Redemption” at the age of 14 in 2011. At the time, mainland Chinese media called him “China’s most talented young writer.” He claimed that his maternal grandfather was a high ranking Chinese communist official whose name he’s reluctant to publicize. In recent years, Yi has become a vocal critic of the communist regime. He usually resides in Japan.Yi and his group of nine friends were traveling from the Netherlands to Germany on March 7 when they decided to buy some supplies, clothes, and food to drive them to Medyka and volunteer.Yi said that after arriving at the border to help the refugees, he felt the reality was very different from what he imagined. It was really hard to be a volunteer.He witnessed a lot of refugees coming from Ukraine, all who had a look of desperation on their faces. “You could see that those people were very helpless. There was no place for the children to sleep, it was super cold,” he said.“They had no food at all and they were very helpless. Most of them can’t speak English or Polish. Many children are the same age as my daughter, which makes me sad. We provide them with food and water as much as possible.”Yi said he also provided some financial help to some Ukrainian refugees he met, as their Ukrainian currency and cards were not accepted in Poland.He said: “We also hope that more people will see and help them. We want to let these refugees see that there are so many people coming to help them to give them hope.”Ukrainian refugees in the Polish border town of Medyka in March 2022. (Supplied by Genkyo Team)Yi said he saw many Ukrainian refugees sleeping in train stations, McDonald’s, and other public places after crossing the Polish border. He helped some refugees stay in hotels.Yi criticized the Chinese regime’s propaganda and its support of Russia’s war, which he said is claiming that “national interests are above everything else.”He said that what the common people want is a good life, and a nation should protect its people—not the other way around.“If this happened to them, they would not say such things,” Yi said of the Chinese who echo the regime’s talking points.“There is no so-called ‘national interest.’ What the people want is very simple—to live in peace and stability. The people can only develop the country’s economy if they are alive. If you talk about those slogans with disregard of people’s lives, who would still follow you?”Zhao Fenghua and Gu Xiaohua contributed to the report.

We do not accept as the military slave,'' in Kamayut township of Yangon, Burma, on April 19, 2021. (AP Photo)By The Associated Press4/20/2021Updated: 4/20/2021PrintBANGKOK—The European Union expanded its sanctions against Burma’s military leaders and army-controlled companies ahead of a regional meeting to discuss the worsening crisis after army leaders deposed the elected government.The Council of the European Union’s latest sanctions target 10 individuals and two military-controlled companies already subject to sanctions by the United States, Britain, and other governments.It is unclear if such moves are having any impact as the military escalates its efforts to crush opposition to its seizure of power. Burma’s economy is already in crisis, worsened by the coronavirus pandemic and by the mass civil disobedience movement that arose following the Feb. 1 coup.The EU said the number of individuals sanctioned was expanded to 35 people it said were responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law, for repressive decisions, and for serious human rights violations.The two military-controlled companies, Myanmar Economic Holdings Public Company Ltd. (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corp. (MEC), have vast holdings in many industries and help to fund the military.All are subject to having their assets frozen, travel banned, and other measures. EU citizens and businesses are banned from doing business or providing funds to them without special permission.“Today’s decision is a sign of the EU’s unity and determination in condemning the brutal actions of the military junta, and aims at effecting change in the junta’s leadership,” the EU said in a statement.“Today’s decision also sends a clear message to the military leadership: continuing on the current path will only bring further suffering and will never grant any legitimacy,” it said.An anti-coup protester throws a smoke bomb against police during a crackdown in Thaketa township in Yangon, Burma, on March 27, 2021. (AP Photo)Since the coup, security forces have killed at least 738 protesters and bystanders, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests. It says more than 3,200 people are still detained, among the nation’s deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint.The EU already had an embargo on sales to Burma of arms and equipment that can be used for internal repression; an export ban on dual-use goods for use by the military and border guard police; export restrictions on equipment for monitoring communications that could be used for internal repression; and a prohibition on military training for and military cooperation with the army.Last week, the U.S. S&P 500 said it was removing India’s Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. from its sustainability index due to its alleged dealings with Burma authorities. Adani did not respond to a request for comment on that move.Former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday exhorted the U.N. Security Council to act immediately to halt the violence and protect civilians. So far, the council has not taken such action, which would likely be blocked by China and Russia.The Association of Southeast Asian Nations—which is holding a summit on Burma this month—maintains a policy of “non-interference” in each others’ political matters and has rejected the idea of imposing sanctions against the junta.Ban urged ASEAN to send a high-level delegation to Burma.

(Courtesy of CountryWide Homes)By Neil Sharma1/18/2016Updated: 1/29/2016PrintWhen you sell the fourth-most homes in the Greater Toronto Area, there’s nary a doubt you’re experienced, esteemed, and elite. After a diligent decade of dazzling design, CountryWide Homes hit a few milestones in 2015, including a new total sales record. CountryWide is bolstered by a stable of veteran executives—some of whom have over 50 years of experience in the industry—who have helped the decade-old company establish unique design hallmarks. “The first 10 years was entry-level, we were new to this game,” Richard Mariani, sales & marketing manager of CountryWide Homes, told the Epoch Times in an interview. “Now we’ve officially established ourselves as a homebuilder, and now we’re going to the next level of calibre. The Mercedes-AMG series is what we like to compare ourselves to. We also have a new design studio we’re going to be building out this year with even higher levels of finishes.” The focus of the new addition of approx 3,000 sq-ft will be luxury design, nestled next to CountryWide’s other 6,000 square-foot studio in the rear of its Concord, Ontario, headquarters. The studios are staffed with qualified interior design consultants to help CountryWide homebuyers personalize finishes and upgrades. CountryWide’s brain trust had the prescience to buy fringe land surrounding the GTA years ago because there were emerging signs that land would become extremely scarce and its costs would consequently surge. It’s one of the reasons CountryWide hasn’t been hampered by the GTA’s housing shortage. Mariani said that because the region is growing at an unprecedented rate, everything, including subways, are now routing northerly. As the need for density grows, high-rises won’t be isolated to Toronto’s core.“We know the way this city is building and expanding. Townhouses may not be the affordable entry-level option in the GTA anymore; it could be the condo option,” he said. “No builder out there looks at what they’re going to sell for just the next year—they’re looking at the next five years, 10 years, down the road. We’re always trying to forecast what’s coming down the pipe.” CountryWide had 18 active sites in 2015, and seven sold out. The company sold 650 homes last year, effortlessly smashing its previous record of 575. However, Mariani partly attributes the good fortune to Toronto’s searing market. While CountryWide doesn’t expect to take a step back in 2016, it forecasts a slower sales year. “We certainly can’t predict the 2016 housing market, but I can say on behalf of our company that we'll anticipate a bit of a slowdown,” he said. “(Last year) was not realistic; it was a hot, hot market. We’re cautious with what we’re releasing and to whom. There are a lot of factors and variables we don’t necessarily know about, like the Canadian dollar (at a 13-year low). It may hurt the local buyer but could help the foreign buyer. We’re here to sell top-quality houses, and a lot of Chinese investors coming here love our product.” He added that CountryWide has 11 sites carrying over into this year, with about six new sites slated to launch sales, give or take a few. Impressively, and as a testament to its vision, CountryWide Homes is one of three builders—the other two are Aspen Ridge Homes and Lakeview Homes—developing a brand new town north of Newmarket called Queensville. In addition to 6,000 inaugural lots, there will be nine schools, a community centre and library, parks, trails, retail, and dining options. The first phase launched last year with 36- and 45-ft lots and townhomes. The second phase will be released in the spring/summer of this year. However, closer to home, CountryWide is developing in-demand projects, for which the Chinese community is particularly keen. The 531-lot Observatory Hill—eponymously named after the historic Richmond Hill district—is a much-anticipated mix of lots ranging between 30 and 50 feet, and will also include semi-detached houses and townhouses. Mariani said the Chinese community has expressed the most interest in Observatory Hill, and many are anxiously awaiting its late spring launch. “People are telling us they’re planning their vacations around our opening because they don’t want to miss it,” he said. “It’s another milestone for CountryWide, and I would assume the other three builders building at Observatory Hill, because this piece of land is the only piece left on Bayview. It’s important for us to make a statement there with quality design so that for years down the line people can say ‘I’m proud I bought at Observatory Hill.’” Another project coveted by many in the Chinese community is an as-yet unnamed project located at Bayview and Steeles Ave. in North York, slated to be built on the site of the former Tyndale University College & Seminary. The surrounding milieu will incorporate much greenery, and lots will be built as wide as 60 feet. “This is in North York. There’s not usually any new development there,” said Mariani. “It’s usually in-fill—someone knocks down a house and builds a one-off. We’re doing this through one-on-one private appointments. I'd compare it to buying a full floor at Toronto’s Four Seasons Private Residences.” The luxury houses will cost over $3 million and will be designed by the renowned Stephen Hunt of Hunt Design Associates. When it comes to Chinese buyers, Mariani says they’re particularly fastidious about amenities like schools, and as a result, CountryWide pays careful attention to where it builds. “At all of our sites’ sales centres, we have amenities maps that highlight all schooling in the areas, from elementary schools through high schools and colleges,” he said. “Now it’s about finding the best schools to build around. We carefully collected sites around good schools. We forecast the land we’re buying around the city.” Neil Sharma is a Toronto-based freelance journalist.

Here are a few nicknames you can begin with for the name Rishika.RishiShikaNikaRishKariRishika’s Zodiac Sign As Per Western AstrologyWestern astrology includes the construction of a horoscope based on the person’s exact time of birth and location to understand the positions of the planet, stars, and zodiac signs at that time. However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below. This will give you a glimpse into the world of astrology tailored for your baby.

Rashi and nakshatra, which are an integral part of Jyotisha, are believed to influence an individual’s personality and life events. The following sections give you rashi-related information, such as the associated letters, elements, ruling body, quality, and nakshatra for the name Rishika. These details help analyze a person’s characteristics, personality, and behavior.Zodiac Sign (Rashi)As shown in the following table, each rashi is associated with specific sounds, which are often used as the starting letters of names for newborns in Hindu families. Each rashi is represented by a figure and one of the five elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether (Space). One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Rashi (zodiac sign)Tula (Libra)Starting letters for Tula (Libra) rashiR, TRepresentationBalanceElementAirRuling bodyVenusQualityMovableBirth Star (Nakshatra)Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth. There are 27 nakshatras, each with its own unique qualities, attributes, and symbolism. Each rashi contains two-and-one-fourth nakshatras in it. For example, Aries contains Ashwini, Bharani, and Krithika nakshatras. The below table provides information on the nakshatras’ degrees on the zodiac circle, their lords and related syllables, for babies born in the Tula (Libra) rashi.

The main outcomes were intraocular pressure (IOP), the number of glaucoma medications, postoperative maneuvers like BN, and subsequent SBR. Success was defined as IOP ⩽ 18 and 20% reduction (criterion A), ⩽15 and 25% reduction (criterion B), and ⩽12 mmHg and 30% reduction (criterion C) reached with (qualified) or without (complete) medications at the last visit. Complete failure was defined as additional glaucoma surgery, loss of light perception, or sight-threatening complications. Multivariable Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates tests were performed.Results:Fifty-eight eyes with either stand-alone or combined Phaco-XEN surgery were included. Complete success by the different definitions was 50.0% (95% confidence interval, 5.8%–84.5%) (A), 50.0% (5.8%–84.5%) (B), and 25% (0.9%–66.5%) (C) whereas qualified success was 38.3% (1.6%–80.1%), 31.7% (2.0%–71.4%), and 0%, respectively, at the 24-months visit. 30% of cases underwent BN with 5-Fluorouracil, and SBR was performed in 17.5% of eyes. Low IOP levels at 1-month and early BN were significantly associated with success. The highest chance of failure was achieved in the combined Phaco-XEN group undergoing SBR.Conclusions:In our real-life setting, the first month IOP was associated with greater success rates. Although BN obtained improved IOP values, SBR was associated with a greater bleb survival in the stand-alone XEN group. Both BN and SBR had poor outcomes in the combined Phaco-XEN group.IntroductionGlaucoma is the leading cause of global irreversible blindness, and it is expected to increase with the aging of the population, achieving an estimated prevalence of 111.8 million people in 2040.1 To date, intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable risk factor to reduce progression, either with first-line antihypertensive topical treatment or more invasive filtering or drainage device surgical procedures. During the last decade, new, less aggressive surgical techniques have changed this scenario. The XEN45 Gel Stent (Allergan, Dublin, Ireland) consists of a 45 µm lumen, 6-mm long porcine preloaded gel stent that creates a controlled outflow of the aqueous humor into the subconjunctival space, forming a subconjunctival reservoir. As in any bleb-forming technique, this filtering bleb needs specific postoperative management, occasionally requiring bleb needling (BN) and/or surgical bleb revision (SBR) to enhance its functionality. The present study aimed to analyze the real-life outcomes of the XEN stent in our tertiary hospital considering all the required postoperative care of this procedure – thus taking BN and SBR procedures into account- and to evaluate accordingly the predictive factors for success and failure.Material and methodsStudy designAll patients who underwent mitomycin-augmented XEN45 Gel Stent surgery with or without phacoemulsification at the glaucoma Department, Hospital Clínic, between June 2016 and May 2019 were included in this retrospective study. This work adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our institution. All patients signed informed written consent before surgery.In the preoperative visit, all patients had a complete ophthalmologic examination including IOP measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry, visual acuity in decimal scale (Snellen Chart), slit-lamp examination, gonioscopy, optic nerve evaluation, and Humphrey visual field testing (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, CA). Surgery was indicated in cases of uncontrolled glaucoma with IOP above target or intolerance to hypotensive medical treatment and it was performed by two experienced glaucoma surgeons (EM and MP). To ensure high generalizability, no exclusion criteria in terms of the type of glaucoma or previous glaucoma procedures were used. Patients had to have at least 6 months of follow-up postoperative data to be incorporated in the analysis. Data of both eyes of the same patient were included if they met the inclusion criteria.Surgical techniqueThe ab-interno surgical technique of the XEN45 implantation is described elsewhere.2 In all cases, 0.1 ml of mitomycin C (MMC) at 0.1 mg/ml was injected before implantation and subconjunctival stent placement was aimed with final verification of its free mobility at the end of the procedure. In those patients who underwent combined Phaco-XEN surgery, cataract extraction and in-the-bag intraocular lens placement were performed before XEN implantation.Postoperative careIn all eyes, glaucoma medications were discontinued on the day of surgery. Postoperatively, topical ofloxacin and dexamethasone drops were administered during the first week; afterwards, dexamethasone eyedrops were tapered for the following 3 months. Considering this is a retrospective study, the criteria to perform BN was not set in advance; however, the following general principles were followed: BN was indicated in all patients who did not present sufficient IOP reduction, or when prompt signs of failure were present, such as bleb encapsulation, lack of response to digital massage, or marked hyperemia or corkscrew vessels beyond the 1-month postoperative visit. BN was carried out either at the slit lamp or in the operating room according to each surgeon’s preference. Under topical lidocaine and diluted povidone-iodine, careful subconjunctival dissection above and below the stent with a 30-gauge bevel-up needle starting as posteriorly as possible, and a 0.1 ml 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) injection were performed.Surgical bleb revision (SBR) was indicated in those eyes with prior unsuccessful needling; but also, in those with insufficient IOP reduction that presented a markedly flat filtering bleb without visualization of the stent under the conjunctiva at the slit-lamp examination that could preclude from performing a correct BN technique (to avoid unnoticed damage of the stent). All SBR procedures were performed in the operating room. A fornix-based conjunctival flap was fashioned; after blunt dissection and removal of the fibrous tissue, XEN45 permeability was checked either with direct visualization or with trypan blue dye injection in the anterior chamber. Subconjunctival injection or sponge-applied 0.1 ml of MMC (0.01%) was also administered. Finally, the conjunctival wound was closed with interrupted 10-0 Nylon sutures.Outcome measuresPreoperative data within 2 months before surgery, and postoperative records at day 1, week 1, and 1, 3, and 6 months, and every 6 months until the 24-month visit were included in the analysis. The definition of success and failure followed previously reported recommendations for surgical trials.3 Complete failure was defined as loss of light perception, or sight-threatening complications, or the need for further glaucoma surgery, irrespective of IOP. If a new glaucoma procedure was recommended but it was declined by the patient, this was also considered a failure. Surgical success was defined and stratified by three levels of IOP reduction: IOP < 18 mmHg and 20% reduction (criterion A); IOP < 15 mmHg and 25% reduction (criterion B); and IOP < 12 mmHg and 30% reduction (criterion C); and further characterized as a complete or qualified success if the mentioned criteria were achieved without and with antihypertensive medications. The surgical success was analyzed for both the BN and SBR groups.The primary outcomes were IOP and the number of medications over time, the success and failure outcomes considering BN and SBR, and the analysis of predictive factors for success.Statistical analysisThe Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the sample distribution. Independent and dependent sample t-tests, when possible, were used to compare the outcomes between groups. Generalized estimated equations (GEE) were used to adjust for potential correlations between both eyes from the same individual. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and survival comparison considering failure and the three success criteria were performed using the Breslow (generalized Wilcoxon) test after clustering the cases from the same patients. A univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors for surgical failure and tonometric success. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Then, a multivariable Cox model was built. Criteria for model selection were guided by the univariate analysis and clinical significance of the variables. Again, as both eyes of the same patient could be included, correlations were considered with a shared frailty adjustment. For continuous variables described in prior reports as predictive factors for success (i.e. 1-week and 1-month IOP values), the possible influence of multicollinearity was assessed using variance inflation factor analysis. For all tests, statistical significance was set at two-tailed p < 0.05. Data analysis was performed with Stata v14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).ResultsParticipantsA total of 58 eyes of 51 patients were included in the study. 57.6% were female. The mean preoperative age was 73.7 ± 10.2 years (range 45–89). The rest of the baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1.Table 1.

During follow-up, data of 38 eyes (65.5%) were available at the 1-year visit, and only 10 eyes (17.2%) completed the 24-month visit. Both IOP and the number of medications were significantly reduced at each post-operative visit (Supplemental Table S1). The comparison between stand-alone versus combined phaco-XEN surgery using GEE showed that stand-alone surgery achieved a higher IOP reduction compared to the combined Phaco-XEN procedure at 1-day, 1-week, and 1-month time points (p < 0.01, Wald chi-squared). The number of antihypertensive medications also differed: those patients that had undergone stand-alone surgery used fewer medications on day 1 (p < 0.01) and 1-week (p < 0.05). During follow-up, the eyes in the stand-alone group experienced greater IOP and glaucoma medication reduction compared to combined Phaco-XEN only at the 1 day, and 1-week postoperative visits; however, these differences were no longer statistically significant from the 1-month time point.Figure 1. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and the number of glaucoma medications changes during the follow-up. Bars represent the standard deviation, respectively.Pre-op: baseline IOP; d: day; w: week; m: month.Survival analysisFigure 2(a) represents the survival analysis for complete failure. During follow-up, six cases were classified as a complete failure. Of those, one case had a bleb infection and five required a subsequent glaucoma surgery (two trabeculectomies, one ExPRESS mini-shunt implant, one Ahmed valve, and one XEN extraction after complete displacement into the anterior chamber). No other sight-threatening complications or loss of light perception were recorded. Cumulative percentages (95% CI) for complete failure were 0.0%, 7.8% (2.9%–22.8%), 14.2% (5.0%–36.9%), and 14.2% (5.0%–36.9%) for 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. Considering criterion A definition (Figure 2(b)), qualified and complete success rates were, respectively, 84.3% (68.1%–92.7%) and 100% at 12 months and 38.3% (1.6%–80.1%) and 50.0% (5.8%–84.5%) at 24 months; according to criterion B (Figure 2(c)), qualified and complete success rates were 63.4% (46.6%–76.3%) and 50.0% (5.8%–84.5%) at 12 months and 31.7% (2.0%–71.4%) and 50.0% (5.8%–84.5%) at 24 months, respectively; and for criterion C, (Figure 2(d)), qualified and complete success rates were, respectively, 34.7% (20.4%–49.4%) and 50.0% (5.8%–84.5%) at 12 months, and 0% and 25.0% (0.9%–66.5%) at 24 months (Supplemental Table S3).Figure 2.

In the failure analysis, pre and postoperative IOP at the 1-day and 1-week visits were significantly correlated with failure. After surgery, using the B and C success cut-offs (Supplemental Table S3), IOP at the first-month visit was significantly correlated to increased risk of failure. In our success predictive model, day 1, day 7, and 1-month IOP showed no collinearity (mean-variance inflation factor = 1.17).Table 2.

Bold figures represent statistical significance.Bleb needlingBN was performed in 15 cases during the first postoperative year, and 3 of them were lost to follow-up. At the 12-month visit, 12 eyes (30%) received a first BN with 5-FU (time in months, median (interquartile range) = 2 (1–2). Three (7.5%) of the 12 cases received a second BN (2.5 (2–3) months). The incidence rate of BN was 1.1 needling/year in the stand-alone XEN group and 0.9 needling/year in the combined phaco-XEN group (p > 0.05) (Supplemental Figure S1). Table 2 and Supplemental Table S4 show the effect of bleb needling in the multivariable Cox regression model for the three success criteria. BN was not relevant to the model when following criterion A; however, for the 15 and 12 mmHg thresholds, it was associated with a higher survival (only statistically significant in the case of criterion B). To determine any correlation between the type of surgery and BN, a separate Cox regression analysis was performed (Supplemental Table S3 and Figure S3). In both stand-alone and combined Phaco-XEN surgeries, BN was not associated with an increased success rate when using the <18 mmHg cutoff (Figure 3(a)).Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for cumulative qualified success following the criterion A definition, when stratified by the type of surgery (black and gray solid lines, XEN surgery; dashed lines, combined Phaco-XEN surgery) and the type of postoperative intervention ((a), bleb needling; (b), surgical bleb revision).SBR: surgical bleb revision; w/: with; w/o: without.Surgical bleb revisionDuring the first year, SBR was performed in seven (17.5%) eyes. The incidence rate of SBR was 0.4 SBR/year in the stand-alone XEN group versus 0.8 SBR/year in the combined group (p > 0.05, Breslow test) (Supplemental Figure S1).Table 2 and Supplemental Table S4 show the effect of SBR in the multivariable Cox regression model for the three success criteria. In the three success definitions, SBR was associated with failure, although without statistically significant differences. Only XEN-alone surgery benefited from SBR; nonetheless, the HR presented (either a low risk of failure in XEN with SBR or high risk of failure in combined Phaco-XEN plus SBR) were not statistically significant (Figure 3(b)).Postoperative complicationsPostoperative complications are summarized in Table 3. Two patients passed away, both cases unrelated to the XEN procedure. Hypotony (IOP < 5 mmHg) was diagnosed in 18 eyes in the first postoperative week, but only three cases presented a flat anterior chamber. Choroidal detachments were found in five cases. All of them resolved uneventfully. The intracameral end of the stent was obstructed by the iris in four eyes and by a vitreous wick in one eye (exfoliation syndrome). Three cases were resolved after the YAG laser, and one case required an Argon iridoplasty for iris release. Finally, in one case, IOL luxation into the vitreous cavity and posterior scleral fixation of the IOL was performed.Table 3.

The present study shows the performance of XEN45 in a real-life setting including both BN and SBR outcomes.Overall, we found a comparable IOP and antihypertensive medication burden reduction at 12 months to that described in other retrospective studies (26.4%–30.5%).9,10 However, a recent paper performed in a similar population reported a slightly smaller IOP reduction of 24.5%, possibly due to their lower preoperative IOP values compared to the ones observed in our study (18.3 vs 23.5 mmHg, respectively).11Although there is still a lack of randomized, controlled clinical trials comparing XEN to other bleb-dependent surgeries, recent efforts have been made to elucidate the main failure and success predictors. One of the most studied factors is the influence of the combination of phacoemulsification, although its association to failure is still unclear. While Mansouri et al.12 found a higher proportion of patients in the success group with the stand-alone XEN surgery, Hohberger et al.13 reported lower IOP values with the combined Phaco-XEN procedure. Recent work with the longest follow-up time published so far14 showed that despite logistic regression analysis suggested no correlation with the type of surgery, Kaplan-Meier curves found higher success rates in the stand-alone group. In our study, although the XEN stand-alone had a greater IOP reduction, this difference was not statistically significant.Early postoperative IOP values have also been evaluated as potential predictors for failure and success. Previous publications have reported that an elevated first 24 h IOP measurement could be significantly associated with failure15 and greater needling rates.16 However, other factors like stent positioning, transient reduced aqueous humor production, and remaining ocular viscoelastic also determine this first day IOP assessment and therefore need to be taken into account.15 Moreover, modifications in the bleb morphology have been described up to the first postoperative month which could result in better IOP outcomes at a later stage.17 In this regard, Fea et al.18 have suggested using 1 month postoperative IOP determinations as a predictor of success, finding that a difference of <6 mmHg between week-1 and month-1 intraocular pressure measurements was associated with a final IOP of <16 mmHg. Similarly, in our cohort, higher IOP values at 1 month were correlated with a greater probability of failure in the regression model for both criterion B and C.As in any bleb-forming procedure,19–21 postoperative management may be required to optimize its function. In line with our BN rate of 30%, recent publications have reported approximately 30%–40% postoperative needling rates in both retrospective9,10 and prospective12,22 studies but it can be as high as 62% of BN when more than one needling is performed in the same eye.23 These differences may be due to the lack of consensus among studies in the indications and the number of bleb BN required.24 Interestingly, we found that, although BN was a reasonable postoperative maneuver in the stand-alone XEN group to obtain better IOP values (predictor of better outcomes for definitions B and C), it was not able to significantly increase bleb survival in the combined Phaco-XEN group.If BN is not successful, a potential alternative is an open SBR. This approach has been useful to restore aqueous outflow in cases of marked scarring or when the XEN implant is not visible enough to ensure a good needling technique.25 Although SBR after XEN45 has not been widely evaluated, several studies have shown rates between 9.2%7 and 34%.26 In our study, 17.5% of cases underwent major SBR. Overall, SBR was correlated with an increased risk of failure, and when further stratified with the type of surgery, K-M survival estimates showed that SBR did not increase success probability in the combined Phaco-XEN group. In previous studies, SBR has shown percentages of success as high as 90% with better results in stand-alone surgeries in pseudophakic eyes.26 We hypothesize that phacoemulsification-derived particles may enhance bleb inflammation and scarring, as described in other filtering procedures.27 Additionally, intraluminal organic material obstructing glaucoma implants has been found in combined Phaco-Express P50 procedures in which SBR was unsuccessful.26 Anterior segment optical coherence tomography has illustrated similar intraluminal obstruction in cases with prior combined phaco-XEN surgery and signs of a flat, nonfunctional bleb.27 Further studies including systematic anterior segment bleb and stent imaging are needed to validate these hypotheses.Regarding postoperative complications, the overall number in this audit may be slightly lower7,9,25,28 compared to other publications due to two reasons: first, postoperative BN was not considered as a complication but as part of postoperative care; and second, to ensure clinical applicability of our study, IOP < 6 mmHg without structural or functional changes was not taken into account as a complication by itself and hypotony was only recorded if flat anterior chamber, macular folds, or choroidal detachments were also present.29Our study has several limitations. First, due to the retrospective design of the study, a potential selection bias may be considered when analyzing these real-life results. Second, various patients of the study missed some of their appointments, and others were lost to follow-up which could have underpowered our analysis. Third, the incorporation of a myriad of different glaucoma included certain subtypes, such as PEX and/or uveitic glaucoma, which may have been more prone to failure, thus undermining our results. Fourth, due to the relatively small sample size, the survival estimates (as shown by the wide CI intervals) may have been biased, as also occurred with the detection of significant IOP reductions and predicting factors.ConclusionIn this real-life study, the XEN gel implant achieved a significant IOP and glaucoma medication burden reduction. The most important predictive factor of success was lower IOP values 1 month after surgery. BN was able to obtain greater IOP reductions in the stand-alone group, but it did not increase the overall bleb survival. SBR had better outcomes in the stand-alone group and showed poor results in the combined Phaco-XEN group, suggesting that a subsequent glaucoma surgery may be a better alternative in these cases. The evaluation of predictive factors of success and failure provides a more tailored approach, finding those cases that need closer follow-up and earlier postoperative interventions.AcknowledgmentsPresented in part as an oral communication at the Spanish Glaucoma Society Congress Virtual Meeting, 2020.

(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)By The Canadian Press5/25/2020Updated: 5/25/2020PrintVANCOUVER—Money laundering in British Columbia will be under scrutiny again this week when a public inquiry resumes today.Over the next 3-1/2 weeks, expert witnesses ranging from academics to police officers are expected to shed light on how dirty money is quantified and the regulatory models that are being used to fight it around the globe.The B.C. government called the inquiry amid growing concern that illegal cash was helping fuel its real estate, luxury car, and gambling sectors.Opening arguments were held in February and the main hearings scheduled to begin in September will delve into specific industries.Commission lawyer Brock Martland says the goal of this part of the inquiry is to create an understanding of what money laundering is and the strategies other countries have used to get a grip on it.The hearings are being streamed online.Expert witnesses will include Simon Lord of the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency, RCMP Chief Supt. Robert Gilchrist of the Criminal Intelligence Service of Canada, and Oliver Bullough, author of “Moneyland: The Inside Story of the Crooks and Kleptocrats Who Rule the World.”“The sort of game plan is to have the view from 30,000 feet,” Martland said.The inquiry is being led by commissioner Austin Cullen. Attorney General David Eby has said he hopes it will answer lingering questions about how the criminal activity has flourished in the province.B.C. also commissioned three reports that revealed B.C.’s gambling, real estate, and luxury car industries were hotbeds for dirty money, but Eby said an inquiry will be able to dig deeper because it can compel witnesses to speak.In February, the B.C. Real Estate Association told the inquiry that it supported the creation of a provincial land registry that identifies those buying property. It has also struck a working group to make anti-money laundering recommendations.The B.C. Lottery Corp. said it has consistently reported suspicious transactions to Fintrac and pointed out unusual conduct to the gaming policy enforcement branch.The corporation has also brought in measures to control or prevent the flow of dirty money since 2012, including creating an anti-money laundering unit made up of certified investigators and intelligence analysts.And the Great Canadian Gaming Corp., which owns several B.C. gambling sites, also defended the company’s efforts to limit money laundering, telling the inquiry that criticism of the industry is unfounded.A coalition of tax fairness groups told the inquiry at the time that hiding ill−gotten cash behind shell companies is so widespread in Canada it’s known globally as “snow washing.” Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowThe Canadian PressAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesRCMP Form National Co-ordination Team in Response to Extortion SchemesFeb 15, 2024RCMP Use of Private-Sector Surveillance Services Worries Federal Privacy WatchdogFeb 15, 2024Prime Minister and Manitoba Premier Announce $633M in Health FundingFeb 15, 2024Some Members of Parliament, Ministers Assigned Police Protection as Security TightensFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsBritish Columbiamoney launderingCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

(Kacper Pempel/Reuters)By Reuters7/13/2021Updated: 7/13/2021PrintWARSAW—A top Polish court will rule on Tuesday on whether the country’s constitution or European Union treaties take precedence, the first of two rulings this week that could bring Warsaw’s conflict with Brussels over the rule of law to a head.Warsaw aims to hit back at what it says is unjustified interference in its internal affairs by the European Commission, but critics say that questioning the primacy of EU law undermines the functioning of the bloc and jeopardises Poland’s continued membership.Poland is embroiled in a long-running dispute with the EU over judicial reforms that critics say undermine the independence of the judiciary, but which the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party say are needed to make courts function more effectively and remove a residue of communist influence.Poland says the reforms are an internal matter.“We have seen in recent years that EU bodies such as the European Commission or the Court of Justice of the European Union acted in violation of the treaties when they decided to interfere in the Polish judicial system,” said Deputy Justice Minister Sebastian Kaleta.‘Crossing the Rubicon’Poland said in March that Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki would ask the Constitutional Tribunal to rule on whether the country’s constitution or EU treaties are more important. The tribunal will rule on this on Tuesday.As part of proceedings initiated by Brussels against Poland, the Court of Justice of the EU told Warsaw last year to suspend a panel created to discipline judges.The panel—the Supreme Court’s disciplinary chamber—asked the Constitutional Tribunal whether such a suspension was constitutional. The tribunal will also rule on this on Wednesday.The European Commission has asked Poland not to question the primacy of EU law, expressing concern that it is contesting the bloc’s fundamental principles, and some observers have warned of potentially serious consequences if it does so.“In my view if they [PiS] do cross the rubicon... not only infringement actions are on the table,” said Laurent Pech, professor of European law at Middlesex University, London.“I would say that it is going to make it very easy to activate the rule of law conditionality mechanism, so that should also result most likely in a suspension of EU funding.”Government critics say the Constitutional Tribunal itself has become politicized as a result of PiS’s reforms, an accusation the government denies.The tribunal’s head, Julia Przylebska, was described by PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski as a “close friend.”The European Court of Human Rights ruled in May that a Polish company had been denied its right to a proper hearing in the Constitutional Tribunal due to the illegal appointment of a judge.By Alan Charlish Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowReutersAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesDollar on Track for 5th Straight Weekly Gain, Yen FragileFeb 16, 2024Oil Slips as Weaker IEA Demand Outlook Offsets Rate Cut HopesFeb 16, 20242 Fans Came to See Kansas City Chiefs; They Stopped Suspected ShooterFeb 15, 2024Wall Street Opens Flat After Mixed Economic DataFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsPolandjudicial systemCourt of Justice of the European UnionSebastian KaletaCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

I'm going to share with you how I made it and then how to style it two ways. One dressed up and ready for a day in the office and one as cosy loungewear! I used the Jackson Tee and sweater pattern by Helens Closet which you can find here > Jackson Tee and Pullover » Helen's Closet Patterns (helensclosetpatterns.com) and for the snuggest sweater I used this Denim Blue fleece backed sweat shirting from Minerva which you can grab here > Minerva Core Range Melange Polycotton Fleece Back Sweatshirt Stretch Knit Fabric | 1422460 | Minerva The Jackson, comes as both a Tee pattern with short sleeves and as a sweater both of which can be a longer or cropped shape. I chose the sweater with long sleeves and the shorter more cropped length as I think its more flattering and suits my style more. The first step was to join the front and back bodice at the shoulders. The next step is to stitch the sleeves onto the bodice, right sides together. Next up we stitch the long side seam together from the sleeve cuff all the way through the under arm right down to the waistband. We're almost finished as this is such a quick make, just the cuffs, neck band and waist band to apply and we're all ready to style it up! I really love how this sweater can be styled up with some nice black shoes, smart trousers and a crisp white shirt under neath, I think this is a perfect smart work wear outfit. However, come he weekend, this styling as lounge wear with some cosy joggers could not be more comfy!! Enjoyed the project? WOW SAVE You can do it!

I came across another of this table - an exact match - and decided to try a different technique with the same design. This was how it looked before This time, I decided to paint the base in Velvet Finishes Luxurious, which is a really nice black. Velvet Finishes paints have a sheen to them that is perfect. I believe I am telling this right in that they are a mineral paint -- they are not such a matte, FLAT finish as chalk paint. On the top I used Wise Owl Chalk Paint in the color Sterling. I feel this white has a grey undertone to it and would complement my design well. I then created the design to use on the table (it's just a little bit different than the first calla lily table I had done). And I got to work staining. I use MinWax Ebony stain to create my artwork. For the stamens, I used Wise Owl Paints in the color Beeswax mixed with General Finishes wood dye in yellow. This adds just a touch of color, which makes the piece have one more added dimension. So here is a picture of the previous calla lily stained table - the wood version, unpainted top. You can read more about this project here: http://www.mmembellishments.com/single-post/2016/07/18/Hand-Stained-Calla-Lily-Coffee-Table Which do you prefer? I would be very interested in your feedback as to which you prefer. Btw, the stained one I did was a much more subtle effect than the pieces I typically do. I didn't take the wood down quite as raw or light as I normally do, so the staining ended up being quite subtle. I would love for you to pop over to my facebook page and give me some love! :) You can also follow along on my website: www.mmembellishments.com Enjoyed the project? WOW SAVE You can do it!

I much prefer that over the wood stained one. I've always been a fan of black and white, in fact, have had many rooms decorated in those colors over the years. My question is -- is this for sale ? I would buy this in a heartbeat !! My mom's favorite flowers were calla lilies -- she carried them when she married my dad. This table would be a lovely remembrance of her. Please let me know !!

Are you hosting this year?! If so, a pretty tablescape is a great way to welcome guests!I am going to show you how to create a simple and easy Thanksgiving tablescape using decor you may already have on hand! First, start with a table runner or table cloth! If you don't have one on hand, use a long scarf! They also make beautiful runners! I had this dough bowl, so decided to use it as my centerpiece. You can always use a basket or even a pretty platter! They are all capable of holding items! Faux floral is my friend! I mean, I would love to have the real thing; but if faux is what you have, it does the trick too! I bought mine at Joann's Craft Store.Arrange the floral however you like!! Pumpkins And Thanksgiving fruits are a great filler! I gathered a bunch of faux pumpkins I had lying around. I added some faux pears too. I always dress my settings up with chargers! You don't always need fancy , shiny , or holiday themed plates and chargers. I use these wicker woven ones for various seasons. One way I like to add a touch of color to my tablescapes is with cloth napkins. I use these pretty pale yellow colored ones for my fall and Halloween tablescapes.I personally love the seasonal napkins from Hearth & Hand at Target. They always have pretty, subtle napkins for the seasons. To top off each setting, I add a dinner plate and salad plate. In my case, I used plates I had on hand. The little pumpkin plates are more for decor purposes. I don't think they would hold much salad. LolI found the pumpkin plates in Target's Dollar Spot last year. Unfortunately, I don't think they had them this year. That's it! Super easy and pretty. Tablescapes don't always have to be extravagant and fancy to be welcoming!

The third place match will be played on Saturday.See an AP story below.Aguero: Brazil Collapse Can Happen to AnyoneBELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) — Germany’s 7-1 thrashing of five-time champion Brazil has left no doubt among Argentina’s players about the challenge they face in the World Cup final on Sunday.Striker Sergio Aguero says he and his Argentine teammates obviously took notice of the rout.“Germany is a great team. What happened to Brazil could happen to any team,” he said.But, Aguero added, the Germans also have reason to be concerned, “knowing that we have players who can create danger up front — We’re in the final for a reason.”After injuring his left thigh in Argentina’s last group-stage match against Nigeria, the Manchester City striker was sidelined for two knockout games before going on as a substitute in the semifinal Wednesday against the Netherlands. He failed to have an impact in the attack but scored the third penalty in Argentina’s 4-2 shootout win.“When you come back from injury, in the back of your mind you are worried about it happening again,” Aguero said. “When you miss three matches in a World Cup with the rhythm the guys have you realize you are lacking something.“But if I get called up to play in the final I will try to find the energy from wherever to do it as well as possible.”Argentina hadn’t advanced beyond the quarterfinals since the 1990 World Cup, so the country is euphoric about the team’s success in Brazil.Unlike Germany, Argentina has advanced with single-goal margins against its opponents and couldn’t score before the shootout against the Netherlands. Four years ago in South Africa, Argentina lost 4-0 to Germany in the quarterfinals.“At this point who is favorite, who is not, it doesn’t make a difference,” midfielder Maxi Rodriguez said. “Both teams feel a responsibility to go all the way. We’re going to do our part to make it.” Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowLarry OngAuthor (Journalist)FollowLarry Ong is a New York-based journalist with Epoch Times.

(Reuters/Romeo Ranoco)By Reuters3/19/2018Updated: 3/19/2018PrintMANILA—Philippine firefighters said on Monday the death toll from a fire in a hotel in the capital Manila had risen to five, after confirming two more fatalities and putting out the blaze a day after it broke out.All the victims were employees at the hotel casino owned and operated by state gaming regulator Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp.The Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) said it was still verifying a report that another victim that was brought to the hospital had also died. Several people were injured.Around 300 guests and more than 70 Pagcor employees, who were evacuated from the Manila Pavilion Hotel and Casino as the fire raged through several floors, have all been accounted for, firefighters said.The hotel is owned and operated by Acesite (Phils.) Hotel Corp, a subsidiary of Waterfront Philippines Inc.“Hotel operations have been temporarily suspended until the proper clearances from the government regulatory agencies have been obtained,” Acesite told the Philippine Stock Exchange on Monday.The company said it was still waiting for the BFP’s final report on what really caused the fire.Firefighters said several floors of the 509-room hotel were “totally damaged” but their investigation was still incomplete.Shares of Acesite, which said the hotel was its main operating asset, fell as much as 10 percent at one time during morning trade, while Waterfront shares declined as much as 8.3 percent.Recommended Video: Kangaroo Attacks Cyclist Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowReutersAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesDollar on Track for 5th Straight Weekly Gain, Yen FragileFeb 16, 2024Oil Slips as Weaker IEA Demand Outlook Offsets Rate Cut HopesFeb 16, 20242 Fans Came to See Kansas City Chiefs; They Stopped Suspected ShooterFeb 15, 2024Wall Street Opens Flat After Mixed Economic DataFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

But there are ways couples can overcome these struggles together, experts say.ByJulia MétrauxMedically ReviewedbyAllison Young, MD of American College of Lifestyle Medicineon December 14, 2023Isolating yourself from your partner may be a sign that depression is negatively affecting your relationship.Rob and Julia Campbell/StocksyDepression can weigh on many aspects of people’s lives, and that includes romantic relationships and marriage, research shows.Although the exact causes of relationship strain vary from couple to couple, one key reason may be that common symptoms of depression — such as irritability, loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed, fatigue, and lack of energy — can affect a relationship.For instance, “Some individuals who experience depression may feel guilty about not having the energy to spend time with their partner, but they may also feel stuck due to their depressive symptoms,” says Ernesto Lira de la Rosa, PhD, a New York City–based clinical psychologist and an adviser for the Hope for Depression Research Foundation. “Although they know that doing things with their partner will be good for them, they sometimes do not have the mental and physical energy.”If depression is negatively affecting your relationship, it’s important to work together with your partner to address it. In fact, not doing so can have serious consequences. One study of more than 20,200 Norwegian married couples, published in 2015 in BMC Public Health, showed that rates of divorce are significantly higher among couples in which one partner experiences some form of mental distress, such as depression, than in couples in which neither partner experiences mental distress.Here are five signs that depression is taking a toll on your relationship (plus, five tips for lessening its impact).1. You’re No Longer Doing Activities You Both Used to LoveAnhedonia — loss of interest, enjoyment, or pleasure in things once enjoyed — is a hallmark symptom of depression, according to Cleveland Clinic.If you have depression, the condition can affect all parts of your life, including activities you used to find fun and that once made you happy, per Cleveland Clinic. This can be difficult for some partners without depression to understand.“If the couple usually enjoys going out together for movies, dinner, time with mutual friends, and one partner withdraws from these activities because of depression, it may become a point of contention for the other partner,” says Stacey Neal, MD, a psychiatrist at Kaiser Permanente in Baltimore.2. You Experience Self-Esteem Issues That Negatively Affect the RelationshipDepression is linked to low self-esteem and self-criticism, according to Mayo Clinic. It can make some people with the condition feel like there’s something wrong with them, and that other people around them — including their partner — are judging them, explains Dr. Lira de la Rosa. As a result, some people with depression may also question whether their partner truly wants to be in a relationship with them, he adds.“Some partners may internalize that something is wrong with them and may feel that their partner does not find them desirable,” says Lira de la Rosa. “This can translate to them spending a lot of time alone and perhaps saying no to their partner when they would like to do some activities together.”3. You Isolate More From Your PartnerSome people with depression may become withdrawn, even from family and loved ones, according to Mayo Clinic.“For instance, this can lead to someone with depression not sharing with their partner that they are going through a tough time or asking for support from their partner,” says Lira de la Rosa. “As a result, the other person in the relationship may not be aware of what is happening or know how to best support their partner.”Having support from loved ones can be a key part of managing depression, and becoming isolated from others can worsen your symptoms, according to Mayo Clinic.4. You and Your Partner Have More Frequent MisunderstandingsWhile all couples have conflict — and some conflict can be healthy, experts say — conflicts tend to happen more frequently among couples in which one partner has depression. Research shows that many people with depression have more negative interactions than positive interactions with their spouse or partner, compared with people without depression.One potential reason: Heightened irritability and sensitivity are common symptoms of depression. Sometimes in relationships, these symptoms can cause issues that may seem small or innocuous to one partner — like playful teasing, for example — to be misconstrued by the partner with depression, says Dr. Neal.Another common type of misunderstanding, which Lira de la Rosa often sees among his patients, has to do with not knowing the best ways to support each other. For instance, the partner with depression might feel that their partner doesn’t check in on them in ways that they find helpful, or that their partner doesn’t care. “When in reality, the other partner may have tried to check in and offer support and it was rejected,” says Lira de la Rosa.“This then creates a cycle of someone feeling that they are not getting the support they need, but they may not see that their behavior and emotions may push supportive people away,” he adds.5. You and Your Partner Are Less Intimate Than You Used to BeIf you find that depression is hindering your sex life, you’re not alone. Depression leads to sexual dysfunction in almost 83 percent of women and 63 percent of men with the condition, research shows.This can happen for several reasons, including symptoms such as fatigue and lack of energy. What’s more, certain antidepressants can weaken sex drive, cause erectile dysfunction, or make it difficult to reach orgasm, per Mayo Clinic.If depression is negatively affecting your sex life, it can pose several challenges for a relationship. Sexual problems may be something you find distressing, which in turn may exacerbate your depressive symptoms. Or, for instance, some partners may not understand why sex has dwindled and could feel confused or even hurt as a result.RELATED: How to Have a Healthy Sex Life if Depression Is Getting in the Way5 Ways to Manage Depression’s Impact on Your RelationshipWhile living with depression can feel overwhelming, the good news is that there are steps people can take to feel better, which can in turn help improve romantic relationships too. These five tips can help.1. Stick to TreatmentOne of the best ways to lessen the effects of depression on your relationship is to make sure your symptoms are treated. For your best chance at symptom relief, it’s important to be consistent with your treatment (or seek treatment from a mental health professional, if you haven’t already). Psychotherapy and medication are the most common and effective treatments for depression, according to Mayo Clinic.2. Work on Healthy CommunicationLearning and practicing healthy communication skills, such as being honest with each other in respectful ways, validating each other’s feelings, and finding compromise, can help couples address their challenges together, according to The JED Foundation, a nonprofit geared toward improving emotional health and preventing suicide among teens and young adults.3. Try Couples TherapyBy going to therapy or counseling together, couples can learn how to address depressive symptoms and any other issues together as a team, per The Family Institute at Northwestern University. It’s also a great way to learn and practice healthy communication skills.4. Prioritize Self-CareAs the saying goes, you can’t pour from an empty cup. Self-care (any activity you do to take care of yourself so that you can be healthy, well, and productive) is a key part of a healthy relationship, according to Love Is Respect, an intimate partner violence prevention organization. Regularly practicing self-care can help you feel better and allow you to be a more present partner, per McNulty Counseling and Wellness.5. Try to Rekindle IntimacyAs noted earlier, there are several reasons that depression can put a strain on your sex life, including reduced sex drive, sexual dysfunction, and the side effects of antidepressants.If you feel your depression is negatively affecting your sex life (and your relationship as a result), there are steps you can take to lessen its impact. For starters, it can help to tell your partner about what you’re going through and why your depression is impacting your sex drive, according to Mayo Clinic. And if both partners feel ready to be intimate again, it can help to start small and slow and gradually ease into it.It can also help to talk to your doctor about what you’re experiencing, because they can help you narrow down the cause. For instance, if you take antidepressants and they’re causing sexual side effects that don’t go away, your doctor may opt to adjust your medication dose or switch you to a different antidepressant, per Mayo Clinic.Editorial Sources and Fact-CheckingEveryday Health follows strict sourcing guidelines to ensure the accuracy of its content, outlined in our editorial policy.

He denies the charges.A man wearing a protective face mask takes part in a rally in support of arrested regional governor Sergei Furgal who is accused of organising the murder of several entrepreneurs 15 years ago, in Khabarovsk, Russia on July 18, 2020. (Evgenii Pereverzev/Reuters)Demonstrators packed a city thoroughfare on a sweltering Saturday afternoon, carrying posters in support of Furgal, some demanding his release, others calling for an open and transparent trial, with the column of marchers stretching into the horizon.Svetlana, a middle-aged woman wearing a face mask, said residents were not put off by the accusations against Furgal. Many Russian politicians have a dark past, she said, as the final years of the Soviet Union were riddled with corruption and crime.“People came out here to defend their voting rights: We elected him, so return him to us,” she said.The protests come barely three weeks after a landslide referendum victory for the Kremlin on amendments to the constitution, allowing Putin to remain in power for another 16 years.

Many develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 60 percent of those with the disorder are haunted by nightmares. Now, a new study from the University of New Mexico suggests a new therapy may ease the emotional fallout of sexual assault. The new approach targets the nightmares rather than the symptoms of PTSD, say the study's authors who report their findings in tomorrow's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study was partly funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health. ""People who have chronic nightmares really do suffer from them,"" says study leader and psychologist Dr. Barry J. Krakow. ""If you have nightmares, you're likely to become fearful of going to sleep, you're going to have awakenings at night, your sleep may be more restless, and the big one is that you're going to feel some daytime impairment, usually in terms of being tired or sleepy,"" he says. And he says patients are likely to be preoccupied with images from their nightmares while awake. Krakow says while the nightmares may have been caused by the same trauma that caused PTSD, the disorder alone isn't likely to fuel nightmares over a long time. Instead, he says, chronic nightmares are both trauma-induced and a learned behavior. ""[The new therapy] permits us and the patient to explore treating the nightmare directly,"" says Krakow. Krakow and his colleagues worked with 168 women, 95 percent of whom had moderate to severe PTSD. Ninety-seven percent had experienced rape or sexual assault; 77 percent also reported a life-threatening sexual assault, and 58 percent also had experienced repeated sexual abuse in childhood or adolescence. Krakow's team randomly divided the women into two groups of 80 and 88. The first group continued to receive whatever treatment they already were getting, while the second group received three sessions of so-called imagery rehearsal therapy. During those sessions, which involved four to eight women at a time, therapists encouraged the women to recognize that their nightmares were trauma-induced and a learned behavior. In the first session, they were also coached in pleasant imagery exercises. One week later, the women wrote about a single nightmare. The therapist told them to change anything they wanted about the nightmare, then to rehearse the new dream for 10 to 15 minutes. Once they left the session, the women had to rehearse the new dream for five to 20 minutes per day. In the third session, the women discussed their progress with the group and asked questions about PTSD, nightmares and sleep. Three months after they started the program, the women were asked about the quality of their sleep, frequency of nightmares and severity of PTSD symptoms. At the six-month mark, the women returned for a personal interview, where the researchers asked similar questions. ""Generally speaking, people [were] able to reduce their nightmares anywhere from 50 to 80 percent,"" says Krakow. In some cases, the nightmares disappeared entirely, although the technique didn't work at all for some survivors. Krakow says most people who use the technique usually will report fewer nightmares, less intense nightmares or a different attitude towards their dreams. Eventually, he says they may experience all three. Rosalind Cartwright, who heads the psychology department at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago, says similar patterns of chronic nightmares also are found in Holocaust survivors and Vietnam veterans. ""Dreams of this kind tend to be repetitive and not self-resolving,"" says Cartwright. ""They don't just fade the way bad experiences usually do. You have no way of coping with it unless you have some focused program during the day."" She says image rehearsal therapy lets patients guide their nightmares to a better end, one without trauma. ""In waking, he has them get a sense of control over that imagery. It is a very focused kind of treatment, and very quick,"" says Cartwright.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)By Reuters7/15/2021Updated: 7/15/2021PrintWASHINGTON—U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed to disagree on Thursday about a Russian pipeline project that Washington opposes, while vowing to stand together against aggression from Moscow and anti-democratic action from Beijing.At what is likely to be the German leader’s final visit to the White House before she retires from politics, Biden praised Merkel’s “exemplary life of groundbreaking service to Germany and ... to the world”.“I value the friendship,” Merkel said in the Oval Office, mentioning America’s role in building a free and democratic Germany after World War Two. Merkel is the first European leader to visit Biden at the White House since his inauguration in January.Despite the cordiality, some disagreements were apparent. Biden reiterated his concerns about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline being built under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany; the United States fears Moscow will use it as a cudgel against Ukraine. The $11 billion project, which is expected to be finished in September, will bypass Ukraine, potentially depriving it of transit fees.The president reiterated that he decided against sanctioning the company behind the pipeline because the project was near completion, a decision that drew criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. But Biden said he and Merkel were united in their belief that Russia should not use energy as a geopolitical weapon.“Good friends can disagree,” he said about the pipeline during a joint news conference.“We stand together and will continue to stand together to defend our eastern-flank allies at NATO against Russian aggression.”Merkel noted the differences of opinion but emphasized points of unity between the two countries. “We all share the same values; we all share the same determination to tackle the challenges of our times,” she said.Biden pledged to have a decision soon on whether to lift a pandemic-related ban on Europeans traveling to the United States that has irked Germany and other allies.Views on ChinaWashington and Berlin also have differing views on doing business with China, which Germany has wooed for trade.“There is a lot of common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor; that trade with China needs to rest on the assumption that we have a level playing field,” Merkel said.But both leaders said they would stand up for democratic principles and universal rights when they saw China or any other country working to undermine them.“We are united, united in our commitment to addressing democratic backsliding, corruption, phony populism in the European Union or among candidates for the EU membership, or anywhere we find it in the world,” Biden said.Biden, 78, and Merkel, 66, do not have much time to strengthen ties between the world’s largest and fourth-largest economies.Merkel, chancellor since 2005, plans to exit Germany’s government after national elections in September. Polling shows her Christian Democrats are poised to take the lead in forming a government after the election, but it remains unclear which parties would be included in a coalition.Biden’s Democratic Party has tenuous majorities in the U.S. Congress that could evaporate in the 2022 congressional elections.John Emerson, who served as ambassador to Germany under former President Barack Obama, said the relationship remains “indispensable” for Washington given Germany’s role as the largest economy in Europe and a NATO ally, as well as its importance as a bridge builder in dealing with Russia, the Middle East and North Africa.Germany hosts some 36,000 U.S. troops on its soil.The White House feted Merkel after the working visit between the two leaders.She and her husband attended a dinner hosted by the Bidens with guests that included U.S. lawmakers, former secretaries of state Colin Powell and Hillary Clinton and the Republican leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate.The White House said the menu included grilled peaches, crispy sea bass, and vanilla ice cream.By Jeff Mason and Andrea Shalal Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowReutersAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesDollar on Track for 5th Straight Weekly Gain, Yen FragileFeb 16, 2024Oil Slips as Weaker IEA Demand Outlook Offsets Rate Cut HopesFeb 16, 20242 Fans Came to See Kansas City Chiefs; They Stopped Suspected ShooterFeb 15, 2024Wall Street Opens Flat After Mixed Economic DataFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsJoe BidenAngela MerkelpipelineCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

Plants, animals, and minerals have been used as primary sources for colourants, dyes or pigments since ancient times. In our daily life, we know about many substances which have specific colours. These are the substances which are used as colourants i.e.; colour imparting species. Both dyes and pigments are coloured as they absorb only some wavelength of visible light. Their structures have Aryl rings that have delocalized electron systems. These structures are said to be responsible for the absorption of electromagnetic radiation that has varying wavelengths, based upon the energy of the electron clouds. Dyes are coloured organic compounds that are used to impart colour to various substrates, including paper, leather, fur, hair, drugs, cosmetics, waxes, greases, plastics and textile materials. A Dye is a coloured compound due to the presence of chromophore and its fixed property to the acid or basic groups such as OH, SO3H, NH2, NR2, etc. The polar auxochrome makes the dye water-soluble and binds the dye to the fabric by interaction with the oppositely charged groups of the fabric structure. Pigments are organic and inorganic compounds which are practically insoluble in medium in which they are incorporated. Dyes and pigments are the most important colourants used to add colour or to change the colour of something. They are widely used in the textile, pharmaceutical, food, cosmetics, plastics, paint, ink, photographic and paper industries. This chapter is devoted to the structure and properties of dyes and pigments.

IntroductionColour provides a significant glimpse of our world. Everyday materials we tend to use different kinds of materials like - textiles, paints, plastics, paper, and foodstuffs. Colours make them most appealing. In summer there is a wild burst of colourful flowers and new leaves of various shades of green on trees [1]. However, in contrast, autumn makes the beautiful impression with green leaves turn to brilliant shades of yellow, orange, and red. Colour derives from the spectrum of light interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities the light receptors [1, 2].A dye is nothing but a coloured substance that has an affinity to the substrate to which it is being applied. The dye is applied in an aqueous solution and needs a mordant to boost the fastness of the dye on the textile fibre. The pigment may be a material that modifies the colour of mirrored or transmitted light as the result of wavelength-selective absorption. Pigments are used for colouring paint, ink, plastic, fabric, cosmetics, food and other materials.Both dyes and pigments appear to be coloured as a result of absorption of some wavelengths of light more than others. However, there are some basic differences between the dyes and pigmentsThe major difference between the dyes and the pigments is that particle size of pigments is much higher as compared to dyes. Due to this small particle size dyes are not UV stable whereas pigments are UV stable.Dyes after dissolving in liquid are absorbed on the material while pigments make a suspension with a liquid that bonds with the material surface.Dyes are generally soluble in water while pigments are almost insoluble in water.Most of the dyes are organic while most of the pigments are inorganicDyes are available in large number in the market while the number of pigments is very less.Dyes impart colour by selective adsorption while pigments adsorb colour either by selective adsorption or by scattering of light.Dyes are combustible while pigments are non-combustible.Dyes have a short lifetime in comparison to pigments.Over the years, man has used colouring matters, which are known as dyes and pigments, for their aesthetic qualities and used them to embellish various articles and the world in which he lived. Indigo, the oldest known dye, was discovered in India; Tyrian purple (or Royal Purple) was discovered in the ancient city of Tyre; Alizarin was discovered among the Turks; and Cochineal was discovered among European and Mexican dyers [3]. Indigenous dye-yielding plants have been discovered in almost every area of the world. The first synthetic dyes were found in the early twentieth century. Parenteral administration was not formulated until the 1930s: methylene blues and methyl violet, for example, were used to treat leprosy and filariasis, respectively [4]. Following World War II, the use of intravenous dyes for medicinal purposes decreased rapidly. Just a few dyes, such as patent blue V or fluorescein, are still used as diagnostic drugs today [5].The textile industry now uses more synthetic dyes. Coal tar and petroleum-based intermediates are the two main sources of these chemicals. Powders, granules, pastes, and liquid dispersions are all available [6, 7]. Active ingredient concentrations usually vary from 20 to 80 percent. The textile dye segment is distinguished by the introduction of new dyes. These new dyes are produced on a regular basis to meet the demands of new technologies, new types of fabrics, detergents, and developments in dyeing machinery, as well as to address the significant environmental issues posed by some existing dyes [8, 9, 10]. With the rapid shift in the textile industry’s product profile, from high-cost cotton textiles to durable and flexible synthetic fibres, the pattern of dye use is also shifting rapidly. Polyesters now account for the majority of dye use. Disperse dyes, which are used in Polyesters, are expected to expand at a faster pace as a result. Textile dyestuffs may be grouped into the following groups for better comprehension if general dye chemistry is used as one of the classification criteria as acid dyes, direct dyes, azoic dyes, disperse dyes, sulphur dyes, reactive dyes, basic dyes, oxidation dyes, mordant dyes (chrome dyes) and vat dyes [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Advertisement 2. Historical background of dyes and pigmentsIn the ancient age usually used all the dyes were natural. Some of the natural dyes used in ancient age were alizarin and indigo. Indigo is probably the oldest known dye obtained from the leaves of dyers woad herb Isatis tinctoria, and the indigo plant Indigofera tinctoria [16]. Early dyes were obtained from animal, vegetable or mineral sources, with no to very little processing. The first synthetic dye, mauve, was discovered serendipitously by William Henry Perkin in 1856. The discovery of mauveine started a surge in synthetic dyes and inorganic chemistry in general.Artists invented the first pigments—a combination of soil, animal fat, burnt charcoal, and chalk—as early as 40,000 years ago, creating a basic palette of five colours: red, yellow, brown, black, and white. In the early age man used earth pigments on cave walls such as yellow earth (ochre), red earth (ochre) and white chalk. Ochres are probably the oldest known pigments, which are coloured clays found as soft deposits within the earth [17, 18, 19, 20, 21].2.1 Reason for the colour of a dyeMany theories have been given to correlate the colour of dyes with their molecular structure. In 1876, Otto Witt, a German Chemist observed that the colour of a dye is due the certain groups containing multiple bonds known as chromophores. Some examples of the chromophores are nitro group(-NO2), nitroso group(-NO), carbonyl group(-CO-), ethylenic bond(-C=C), acetylenic bond etc. As the number of chromophores increases for a dye, the colour of the dye also deepens [17, 18, 19, 20, 21].He also observed that not only the chromophores are responsible for the deepening of colour but also there are certain groups which itself does not act as the chromophore but the presence of which deepens the colour of the dye. These groups are known as Auxochromes. Some examples of the auxochromes are -OH, -NH2, -NHR, -NR2, X (Cl, Br or I), COOH. 1,3-Dinitronapthalene (Figure 1) is pale yellow but the dye Martius Yellow (2,4-Dinitro-1-naphthol) is orange-red (Figure 2) [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Here group -OH is acting as the autochrome as the presence of it has deepened the colour of 1,3-Dinitronapthalene.Figure 1.1, 3-Dinitronaphthalene.Figure 2.2,4-Dinitro-1 naphthol.To explain the origin of colour, Valence Bond Theory (VBT) and Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT) are proposed in modern time. The vital difference between the VBT and MOT is that in VBT electrons are treated in pairs while in MOT electrons are treated singly [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].Valence bond theory (VBT): According to VBT, in the ground state the electron pairs of a molecule are in a state of oscillation and absorb a photon of appropriate energy and get excited when placed in the path of a beam of light. The wavelength of a photon of light adsorbed depends upon the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state.Molecular orbital theory (MOT): According to MOT, whenever a molecule absorbs a photon of light, one electron is transferred from bonding (non-bonding) orbital to an anti-bonding orbital. Based on different type of electron present in a molecule, different types of electronic transitions are possible. Advertisement 3. NomenclatureThe chemical names of dyes are very complicated hence trade names are more popular instead of their chemical names. From the ancient time humans have tried to extract the dyes from plants and other natural sources to colour their clothes and other belongings, such dyes are known as Natural Dyes. Indigo and Alizarin are two examples of natural dyes. As the natural dyes have very few colours and shades so now a day’s most of the used dyes are synthetic dyes having several colours and shades. Almost all synthetic dyes are aromatic and obtained from coal-tar [22]. Hence synthetic dyes are also called coal-tar dyes. Dyes can be classified by the following ways;Based on their constitution: In this classification dyes are classified based on the functional group to which the dyes owe their colour. Some examples are azo dyes, nitro dyes, nitroso dyes, triphenylmethane dyes, indigoid dyes, phthalein dyes, acridine dyes etc.Based on their application: The colouring of dye on a particular fibre depends on the nature of both the dye and the fibre. A dye molecule can be attached to fibre by following methods;Covalent BondsHydrogen BondsIonic BondsVan Der Waals ForcesBased on application dyes can be categorised as follows;Acid dyes: The sodium salt of azo dyes containing sulphonic acid (-SO3H) and carboxylic acid(-COOH) groups are called acid dyes. To colour the fabric from these dyes the acidic solution of these dyes is used. These can be used to colour wool, silk, nylon and polyurethane fibres. The affinity of acid dyes for nylon is very high due to the higher protonation of the free amino group present in polycaprolactam fibres. Orange-I (Figure 3), orange-II, methyl orange and congo red are some examples of it [22, 23].The dye orange I and orange II can be obtained by coupling diazotised sulphonic acid with α and β- Naphthol respectively.Diazotisedsulphonic β-Naphthol Orange-I acid sodium saltBasic dyes: Those dyes which are salts of coloured bases containing amino or dialkylamino group as autochrome is known as Basic dyes. These include triphenylmethane and azo dyes. Modified nylons and polyesters can be dyed with the help of these dyes [22, 23]. Some examples of basic dyes are aniline yellow (Figure 4), butter yellow (Figure 5) and chrysodine G (Figure 6).Direct or substantive dyes: These are water-soluble dyes hence they can be applied to the fabric directly [22, 23]. Congo red and Martius yellow (Figure 7) are two examples of these dyes.Disperse dyes: These are water-insoluble dyes and applied to the fabric in the form of a dispersion in presence of some stabilising agent such as phenol, cresol or benzoic acid. The two examples of disperse dyes are Celliton fast pink B and Celliton fast blue B [22, 23].Fibre reactive dyes: These dyes contain a reactive group which combines directly with the hydroxyl or amino group of the fibre. As a permanent bond formed between the fibre and dye in this case so the colour of the dyed fabric is very fast and has a long life [22, 23].Ingrain dyes or insoluble azo dyes: These constitute about 60% of total dyes used. These dyes are obtained by the coupling of phenols, naphthols, arylamines, aminophenols. These dyes are adsorbed only on the surface of the fabric, colouring by this dye is not so fast. These can be used to dye cellulose, silk, nylon and leather [22, 23]. Para red (Figure 8) is an example of such a class of dye. Para red (Figure 8) dye can be prepared as follow:These dyes are also used in foodstuffs, cosmetics, drugs and as an indicator in chemical analysis.Vat dyes: Vat dyes are insoluble in water so they cannot be used directly for dyeing. They are first reduced to soluble colourless form (leuco form) with a reducing agent such as an alkaline solution of sodium hydrosulphite. Under these conditions, the leucoform develops an affinity for cellulose fibres [22, 23]. Hence these dyes are mainly used to dye cotton fibre. The example of vat dyes is indigo (Figure 9).Mordant dyes: Those dyes which do not bind directly but require a mordant to dye the fabric directly come under this category. The mordant act as the binding agent between the fibre and the dye.Figure 3.Orange-I.Figure 4.Aniline yellow.Figure 5.Butter yellow.Figure 6.Chrysodine G.Figure 7.Martius yellow.Figure 8.Para red.Figure 9.Indigo or Indigotin (Leuco form).Metal ions are used as mordants for the acid dyes while tannic acid is used as the mordant for basic dyes. The desired fabric is first soaked in the suitable metal salt and then this soaked fibre is dipped in the solution of dye when insoluble coloured complexes formed on the fabric. These insoluble coloured complexes are called lakes [22, 23]. So, the metal ions first get attached to the fabric and then the dye molecules are linked to the metal ion through covalent and or coordinate bond (Figure 10).Figure 10.Alizarin-aluminium fibre complex (rose red lake). Advertisement 4. Classification of dyes based on their constitution4.1 Azo dyesThese dyes constitute the largest part of the synthetic dyes. The chromophore of the azo dyes is aromatic system joined to the azo group and auxochromes are NH2, NR2, OH.Azo dyes are classified as the number of azo group in the molecule such as monoazo, diazo and triazole etc. The characteristic of two important azo dyes methyl orange (Figure 11) and congo red can be described as follows:Figure 11.Methyl Orange.4.1.1 Methyl orangeIt is obtained by coupling of N, N-dimethylaniline with diazotised sulphanilic acid.Properties: Methyl orange is a colouring dye for the wool and silk but its colour fades on the exposure to the light and washing. Usually, it is not used as a dye but used as an indicator in the acid–base titrations. The pH range of methyl orange is 3.1–4.4. It is yellow in basic solutions (above pH 4.4) while red in acidic solutions (below pH 3.1) [24, 25, 26]. The colour change takes place because of the change in the structure of ions in acidic and basic medium. In acidic medium, the ion contains p-quinonoid chromophore while in basic medium ion contains azo chromophore (Figure 12).Figure 12.Red (acidic medium) yellow (basic medium).4.1.2 Congo redCongo red (Figure 13) is the example of diazo dye as it contains two azo groups. It is obtained by the coupling of tetrazotised benzidine with two molecules of napthionic acid (4-aminonapthalene-1-sulphonic acid).Figure 13.Congo red.Properties: it is a direct dye and sodium salt of this dye gives red colour on the applied cotton. As on addition of acid, its colour changes so it is also not used as a dye generally. Mostly it is used as an indicator. It is blue in acidic solution (below pH 3) and red in solutions (above pH 3). The change in colour from red to blue in the acidic solution is due to the resonance among charged canonical structures.4.2 Triphenylmethane dyesThese are the derivatives of -NH2, -NR2, and -OH groups in the rings. The compound obtained by this method are generally colourless and called leuco bases. On oxidation, these are converted to the corresponding colourless tertiary alcohols called carbinol bases. These carbinol bases readily change from the colourless benzenoid form to the coloured quinonoid forms in the presence of acids due to salt formation, which is known to be dye [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. The structure and properties of two important triphenylmethane dyes can be discussed as follows;4.2.1 Malachite greenIt is used for dying wool and silk directly and cotton mordanted with tannin. The colour of it fades slowly on the addition of acid and base (Figure 14).Figure 14.Malachite green.4.2.2 Crystal violetA weakly acidic solution of it is purple, a strongly acidic solution is green and still more acidic solution is yellow (Figure 15).Figure 15.Crystal violet.4.3 Phthalein dyes4.3.1 PhenolphthaleinIt is insoluble in water but dissolves in alkalies to form a deep red solution. When an excess of strong alkali is added, the solution of phenolphthalein becomes colourless again. Because of the colour change, it is used as an indicator in acid–base titrations. It is also a powerful laxative (Figure 16).Figure 16.Phenolphthalein.4.3.2 FluoresceinIt is a xanthan derivative. In properties, it more closely resembles phthalein dyes. It is a red powder insoluble in water. It dissolves in alkalies to give a reddish-brown solution which, on dilution, gives a strong yellowish-green fluorescence (Figure 17).Figure 17.Fluorescein.4.3.3 AlizarinIt is one of the most important anthraquinone dye. It occurs in madder root in form of its glucoside called, ruberthyric acid.On reduction with zinc dust, it gives anthracene. This implies that alizarin is a derivative of anthracene. It forms ruby red crystals, insoluble in water and alcohol but dissolves in alkalies to form purple solution, sublimes on heating.It is a mordant dye, and the colour of the lake depends on the metal used. Aluminium gives a red lake, ferric salts give violet-black while chromium salts form a brown-violet lake. It is also used as a purgative (Figure 18).Figure 18.Alizarin.4.3.4 IndigoIt is the oldest vat dye known. India is the birthplace of Indigo (Figure 19). A fusion of indigo at a low temperature produces anthranilic acid.Figure 19.Indigo.It is a dark blue powder, with coppered lustre, m.p. 663 K. It is insoluble in water and most organic solvents. It is widely used for dyeing cotton. The quality of colour is excellent and is stable to light, washing etc. It is also used in printing inks [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Advertisement 5. PigmentsThose organic and inorganic substances which are widely used as surface coatings, employed in ink, plastic, rubber etc. to impart colour. A large number of pigments are used for commercial manufacture of paints.5.1 History of pigmentsPigments are believed to be 3.5 lakh to 4 lakh years old. They have been reported in a cave at Twin Rivers, near Lusaka, Zambia. Blue pigment was derived from lapis lazuli. Pigments based on minerals and clays often bear the name of the city or region where they were originally mined. Synthetic pigments are believed to be introduced in early second millennium BCE. White lead 2PbCO3. Pb(OH)2 and blue frit (Egyptian Blue) also known as calcium copper sulphate CaCuSi4O10 are the two examples of early synthetic pigments [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30].5.2 Classification of pigmentsPigments are mainly classified into two types:White pigmentsColoured pigmentsHowever, they may differentiate broadly into two category organic & inorganic pigments (Table 1) [23, 24, 25, 26].S.No.Organic pigmentsInorganic pigments1.Pthalocyanines, Quinacidrones, Dioxazenes, Napthols, and other pigments made in the lab are examplesExamples include phthalocyanines, quinacridones, dioxazenes, napthols, and other lab-made pigments2.Plants and plant products are the primary source of organic pigmentsTopical cosmetics, as well as dirt, are used to make inorganic pigments3.Carbon chains or carbon rings are still found in Organic Pigment molecules.Metal cations are present in an array shape with nonmetallic anions in the molecules of Inorganic Pigments. This arrangement prevents the pigments from dissolving in the solvent or the plastic.4.Organic pigments have a high index of refractionInorganic pigments have significantly lower values5.Organic pigments are transparentMost inorganic pigments are opaqueTable 1.Difference between Organic & Inorganic Pigments.5.2.1 White pigmentsThey are of various types.

Moreover, recently the consumers have become very much conscious about the environment, renaissance of eco-friendly products and process like dyeing textiles with natural dyes, which has thus become also important now. Thus, revival of natural dye application on textiles and summary of earlier researches on standardisation of its method of extraction, mordanting, dyeing process variables and even natural finishing, etc. have been elaborated in this chapter. Thus this part has become a unique comprehensive chapter for information on structure and properties of dyes and pigments. Advertisement Conflict of interestThere is no conflict of interest.

(The Canadian Press/Patrick Doyle)By Noé Chartier11/21/2023Updated: 11/22/2023PrintX 10:00Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne says he didn’t know that over 1,500 foreign workers would be coming to Windsor, Ont., to work on an electric vehicle battery plant subsidized with $15 billion in taxpayer funds.When asked by reporters in Ottawa on Nov. 21 whether he knew there would be temporary foreign workers brought in to set up the NextStar Energy battery plant, he replied, “No, not necessarily.”“But I’m saying I’m not surprised that you would have transfer of knowledge,” he added. “No one has done batteries in North America before, so you need certain key people to transfer the knowledge.”The plant is a joint venture between European company Stellantis and LG Energy Solution, headquartered in South Korea.Minister Champagne said the knowledge transfer would be done by “very few selected people.”“That knowledge will help us to make sure that this plant is one of the most productive in the industry in North America, so let’s not lose sight of the big picture,” he said.Related StoriesMPs, Unions Voice Concern About Foreign Workers in Gov’t-Subsidized EV Battery Plant11/20/2023Governments Will Spend $5.8 Billion More Than Expected to Build EV Battery Plants in Canada: PBO Report11/18/2023After speaking solo to reporters while on his way to a cabinet meeting, Mr. Champagne came back shortly after accompanied by Immigration Minister Marc Miller, Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, and Labour Minister Seamus O’Regan.Mr. Champagne said he had spoken to the Stellantis CEO the previous day to “bring him up to speed on the situation we’re facing in Canada.”The federal and the Ontario provincial governments announced in July they would provide a $15 billion incentive to Stellantis–LG Energy Solution to build an electric vehicle battery plant in Windsor.Mr. Champagne said he asked Stellantis’s CEO to “take action and to make sure that we respect not only the letter, but also the spirit of our contract with the company, which is to maximize the number of opportunities for Canadians.”The controversy stems from a Nov. 16 Windsor Police post on X which said that as the plant is being built, “we expect approximately 1,600 South Koreans traveling to work and live in our community in 2024.”The post was related to a visit to Windsor by South Korean Ambassador Woongsoon Lim. The police force said it was “grateful” to discuss safety and security with the ambassador and that it looks “forward to the South Korean workforce coming to our community.”The Epoch Times reached out to South Korean diplomatic missions in Canada for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. NextStar also has not returned several inquiries by The Epoch Times.Mr. Boissonnault said there is “no justification that we can see for the number that the South Korean Ambassador raised with 1,600.”He added that his department had conducted one Labour Market Impact Assessment for a job to be filled by the company if no Canadian applied. “There’s one temporary foreign worker that’s been approved for this project,” said Mr. Boissonnault.Mr. Champagne told reporters there would be an “obvious” effort to maximize the number of Canadian workers, and pointed to the CEO of NextStar Energy saying he would hire 2,500 people while another 2,000 would work on building the plant.Immigration Minister Marc Miller said the 1,600 foreign workers number doesn’t “seem credible.”He noted that according to the free trade agreement with South Korea, people can come and go on business visas or visa-free.“We’ve only had fewer than 100 people that have come in,” said Mr. Miller. “They’re training people up as Minister Champagne said.”Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre said on Nov. 20 that no public funding should go to foreign workers and that he would push for an inquiry into the matter.MPs on the industry committee requested a special meeting to discuss the issue on Nov. 21.The federal government and provinces have invested in several major battery plant projects in recent months. The Parliamentary Budget Officer says the tab for taxpayers will be $5.8 billion higher than projected.

(AP Photo)By The Associated Press5/15/2016Updated: 5/15/2016PrintBAGHDAD—The Islamic (ISIS) group launched a coordinated assault Sunday on a natural gas plant north of Baghdad that killed at least 14 people, while a string of other bomb attacks in or close to the capital killed 15 others, Iraqi officials said.The dawn attack on the gas plant began with a suicide car bombing at the facility’s main gate in the town of Taji, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Baghdad. Several suicide bombers and militants then broke into the plant and clashed with security forces. The dead included six civilians and eight security forces; 27 troops were wounded.ISIS-affiliated Aamaq news agency credited a group of “caliphate soldiers” for the attack.READ MORESenior ISIS Leader Abu Wahib Killed in US AirstrikeFBI Director James Comey: Fewer Americans Are Traveling Abroad to Join ISISClosed-circuit television images showed as an explosion hit inside the facility. As flames engulfed the facility and nearby palm trees, pedestrians were seen running for cover. A crowd gathered to watch as thick black smoke rose above the plant, sections of which were left in ruins. The top of one of the gas-processing units was blown off.In a statement, Deputy Oil Minister Hamid Younis said firefighters managed to control and extinguish the fire. He said technicians were examining the damage. Hours after the attack, passers-by inspecting the damage posed for cell phone photos in front of the ruined complex.Elsewhere, four separate bomb attacks left another 15 people dead and 46 wounded in the fifth-straight day of ISIS-claimed attacks in and around the Iraqi capital. Since Wednesday, more than 140 people have been killed in a spate of bombings in Baghdad and elsewhere.Iraqi firefighters try to extinguish a fire at a natural gas plant in Taji, 12 miles north of Baghdad, Iraq, on May 15, 2016. ISIS launched a coordinated assault Sunday on a natural gas plant north of the capital that killed more than a dozen people, according to Iraqi officials. (AP Photo)The wave of attacks comes as Iraqi ground forces have achieved a number of key territorial victories against the extremist group.Brett McGurk, the Obama administration’s diplomatic point man in the international fight against the Islamic State group, told journalists in Jordan that the tide was turning against extremists.“This perverse caliphate is shrinking,” said McGurk, a presidential envoy to the 66-member anti-ISIS coalition.In the past month, ISIS has lost a swath of key territory along a supply route in Iraq’s vast western Anbar province that the extremists had used to ferry fighters and supplies between Iraq and Syria. But after losing territory along the Euphrates River valley, that line has been cut, according to Iraqi and coalition officials.As ISIS militants are pushed back along front lines, the group is increasingly turning to insurgency-style terrorist attacks to detract from their losses, the officials said.However, despite battlefield successes against ISIS, Iraq’s political leadership is in disarray as a deepening political crisis has gridlocked government. Parliament has not met for more than two weeks after supporters of influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr stormed Baghdad’s highly fortified Green Zone. The breach followed repeated delays to government reform legislation that lawmakers claimed would fight Iraq’s entrenched corruption.“It’s possible that some of the political unrest in Baghdad has led (the Islamic State group) to think that they can somehow stir up more chaos than usual,” said Nathaniel Rabkin, managing editor of Inside Iraqi Politics, a political risk assessment newsletter.READ MOREWith the Peshmerga on the Front Lines Against ISISNavy SEAL Killed as ISIS Overruns Kurdish Positions in Iraq“ISIS hopes that somehow if they just keep up the pressure, the Iraqi government will at best collapse or at least become incapable of pursuing a cohesive approach” to fighting the extremists, Rabkin said.While the U.S.-led coalition acknowledges the planning phase of Iraqi military operations against ISIS has been slowed by political unrest, Rabkin says there is no evidence ISIS terrorist attacks have had a direct impact on the military campaign against the extremists.Besides the assault on the gas plant, Sunday’s attacks included a car bomb at a shopping area in the town of Latifiyah, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) south of the capital, that killed seven people, including two soldier, officials said. Eighteen people were wounded in the attack, four of whom were soldiers.Elsewhere in Baghdad, three separate bomb attacks targeted commercial areas, killing at least eight civilians and wounding 28 others, police said. At total of 29 people were killed in the day’s violence.Medical officials confirmed the casualty figures. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information.ISIS extremists still control significant areas in northern and western Iraq, including the country’s second-largest city of Mosul. The group declared an Islamic caliphate on the territory it holds in Iraq and Syria and at the height of its power was estimated to hold nearly a third of Iraqi territory. Iraq’s Prime Minister says the group’s hold has since shrunk to 14 percent.

Whatever your imagination sees, hears – or drives.‘This technology could be bigger than the Internet, even bigger than the industrial revolution’ says Abe Reichental, founder of 3D Systems.And it all begins with… printers?3D-Printers go way beyond paper. His company produces 7 different types of printers that use more than 100 materials, from waxes to metals and rubber-like materials.Car-Parts Can Be PrintedNow even complicated car-parts can be printed. ‘The only traditional way to have all these sections and partitions in it would have been to build it in sections and then weld or screw it together. With 3D printing the whole assembly can be done in one part with no extra work needed’, Abe Reichental says.Bumper on Mid-Sized SedanThe biggest printed object for commercial use so far is the bumper on a mid-sized Sedan. But race cars for example need new parts faster than they can be replaced.Nascar-company Pensky Racing is taking 3D Printing to the next level.

(Verified UGC via AP)By The Associated Press8/17/2021Updated: 8/17/2021PrintWith hundreds of Afghans rushing the tarmac of Kabul’s international airport desperate to flee the return of the Taliban, a young Afghan woman stood in limbo between two worlds.In one world, Massouma Tajik would board a flight to a country she did not know, destined to become a refugee. In another, she would stay in Afghanistan under Taliban rule, forced to wipe out the last 20 years of all that she had built and achieved.Sleepless, hungry, and scared she has been waiting for hours at the airport for a flight she feared would never come with questions she could not answer.“I am in the airport, waiting to get a flight but I don’t know to where,” she said, speaking to The Associated Press over the phone. “I am here, confused, hungry, and hopeless. I don’t know what is coming my way. Where will I go? How will I spend my days? Who will support my family?”Tajik, a 22-year old data analyst working for a U.S. contractor helping Afghan businesses, had gotten the call on Sunday afternoon, informing her she had just 10 minutes to leave for the airport. She had been put on an evacuation list heading to the United States or Mexico—she was told nothing more. She did not have a visa in her passport.This satellite photo from Maxar Technologies shows swarms of people on the tarmac at Kabul International Airport, also known as Hamid Karzai International Airport, on Aug. 16, 2021. (Satellite image ©2021 Maxar Technologies via AP)She left a friend’s apartment in Kabul with just the clothes on her back, a knapsack, a laptop, and her phone.“My dreams and my plans, are all inside this small backpack,” she said.As the Taliban swept into Kabul on Sunday after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country, bringing an end to a two-decade campaign in which the United States and its allies had tried to transform Afghanistan, Tajik and a group of Afghans working for U.S. media were rushed to the city’s international airport by their American friends.The speed of the Afghan government’s collapse, the ensuing chaos, and the near-complete takeover of the country—just two weeks before the final pullout of the last U.S. and NATO troops—has shocked many in Afghanistan and beyond. For Afghan women, it raised fears that all they had achieved in women’s rights, the right to go to school and work, would be swiftly taken away.On the way to the airport, Tajik looked out the window, taking in the last glimpses of Kabul streets, “filled with a scary silence.”There was barely time to call her family in the western province of Herat, seized by the Taliban last week in the insurgents’ relentless sweep. Before the fall, Tajik had fled the city of Herat, the provincial capital and her hometown, for the Afghan capital, “with hope that Kabul would resist.”“But everything changed,” she said. “Everything collapsed in front of my eyes.”Her family did not object to her leaving even though, at 22, she was their breadwinner. That role brought her respect and pride—something the Taliban could take away. She also knew that by staying, she would become a liability for her loved ones—a young woman, educated at an international university, and working with foreigners.“When I left Herat I thought I cannot leave my family like this, but staying there I become a risk for them,” she said. If the Taliban found out, she is convinced “they will hurt my family.”Before leaving Herat, she destroyed all evidence linking her with international organizations, including newspaper clippings. Apart from working as a U.S. contractor, in July she was also featured in a prominent U.S. paper.“I burned them, I buried them, and I left,” she said.Once at the airport, she saw Afghans waiting desperately for a plane out, some breaking into tears. She was tired, she had not slept in three days. Rumors circulated that the planes may even be canceled. Others asked why there was no security and who would protect them.“The Taliban can come at any time,” she said, her voice faltering.Six hours passed. She heard shots ring out from the outside—was it the Taliban?Taliban fighters stand guard in front of the Hamid Karzai International Airport, in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 16, 2021. (Rahmat Gul/AP Photo)From where she was, she could see a plane on the tarmac, but it wasn’t hers. A mad rush of men and women followed, people overtaking one another, desperate to get out. She watched from a cold steel bench, and for a moment, thought of the unknown that awaited her on the other side.“I might end up on the other side of the world, in a refugee camp. I have no food, no money with me,” she said. And she missed her family. “I am worried for their lives,” she said. “All these years of education and hard work, in the hope of making a better life and helping other Afghans ended up being for nothing.”By midnight on Sunday, she thought of giving up and taking a taxi back to Kabul. Herat was out of the question. She got up, but just as quickly changed her mind again.Sleep would not come. She said looters were causing havoc inside the terminal. She left with her travel companions to wait outside on the runway.At daybreak, thousands of Afghans had streamed into the airport. Tajik said she saw U.S. soldiers fire shots in the air. Her flight would be here soon, she was told.Later on Monday, U.S. military officials said the chaos at the Kabul airport had left seven people dead, including some who fell from a departing American military transport jet.“I will never forgive the world for staying silent,” she said. “I didn’t deserve this. No one deserves this.”By Samya Kullab Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowThe Associated PressAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesWorld Shares Follow Wall Street Higher as Japan’s Nikkei Nears Record HighFeb 16, 2024Lyme Disease Case Counts in the US Rose by Almost 70 Percent in 2022 Due to a Change in How It’s ReportedFeb 15, 2024Power Outages Hit Boston Transit System During Morning Rush Hour, Stranding ThousandsFeb 15, 20242 Chinese Fishermen Drown After Chase With Taiwan’s Coast Guard, Which Alleges TrespassingFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsKabulTalibanAfghanCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

(Matt York/AP Photo)By The Associated Press3/9/2019Updated: 3/9/2019PrintPHOENIX—A Phoenix long-term care facility where an incapacitated woman was raped and unexpectedly gave birth in December 2018, has been placed under state supervision since March 8, 2019.The Arizona Department of Health Services and Hacienda HealthCare entered into a voluntary agreement, allowing state regulators to watch over the facility, which houses patients who are intellectually disabled or are medically fragile.The intermediate care facility had long been exempted from state oversight but will now arguably face as much or more scrutiny as any Arizona licensed assisted living centers or nursing homes, with strict oversight requirements in place.“I feel confident that they are going to be able to meet the terms,” Dr. Cara Christ, director of Arizona’s Department of Health Services told reporters. “They are being regulated very similarly to our other licensed entities.”The agreement is an important first step toward restoring the facility’s credibility with the state, Hacienda residents, their families, and the public.“We have completely overhauled Hacienda since January 1st of this year but the improvements are still ongoing,“ Hacienda acting CEO Perry Petrilli said in a statement. ”We won’t stop until we get this 100 percent right.”The facility will prepare to hire a third-party authority to monitor day-to-day operations and lead daily checks on the wellbeing of patients. Hacienda must provide the state with a $50,000 deposit in the event that patient transfers are needed. The facility will also have to make sure it complies with state and federal statutes that pertain to nursing care institutions.Hacienda HealthCare will also be required to undergo unannounced inspections, use a video monitoring system inside the facility and employ people solely to watch out for patient safety. Since the resident gave birth, the center put in place a rule not allowing male caregivers to directly care for female patients without at least another person present.“Obviously, the focus of this agreement is ensuring the health and safety of patients,” Christ said. “It does not shield Hacienda staff or the board from criminal investigations.”The agreement marks the culmination of months of turmoil since the female resident gave birth. Nathan Sutherland, a male nurse who cared for her, was arrested after his DNA matched a sample from the newborn. He has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of sexual assault and vulnerable adult abuse.Just a few days after the news surfaced, Hacienda’s longtime CEO resigned. One doctor was dismissed and another suspended from providing services at the facility. Multiple senior staff employees and two board members left or gave notice of resignation. Former Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley, who was hired by Hacienda to lead an internal investigation, also quit.The departures have not impacted on direct patient care, Petrilli insists.Hacienda officials had planned in February to close down the entire unit where the woman lived, saying it was no longer financially sustainable. The state protested because this would have required relocating nearly 40 other residents who are minors and young adults to other facilities. Hacienda later agreed to relinquish regulation to the state.Intermediate care facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities have not been subject to state regulation in Arizona since the 1990s, when lawmakers approved the exemption for them.Lawmakers appear poised to reverse course.Legislation that requires facilities like Hacienda to apply for state licenses and conduct background checks of employees who care for clients was unanimously approved recently in the Arizona Senate, and is awaiting a House vote.“Hacienda is going to be relieved when they can just be licensed by the department,” Christ said.

This enamel floriform-covered box from the Qianlong period sold for $206,500, ten times its estimate. (Courtesy of Bonhams)By Evan Mantyk7/5/2012Updated: 10/1/2015PrintA recent Bonhams auction of mostly Chinese works of art is the latest evidence that buyers from mainland China are increasingly putting the most cash on the table in the international art marketplace. Some of the works sold for as much as 40 times their presale estimates. During the two-day auction of Asian Works of Art, June 19–20, in San Francisco, a lot described as a group of three jade carvings and estimated to sell for $1,200–1,800 went for an incredible $86,500. Similarly, a 19th-century zitan veneered chair estimated to sell for $2,000–3,000 went for $43,750. A piece described as a “huanghuali and burlwood table, composed of 18th century elements” was originally estimated to go for $40,000–$60,000, but the winning bid, by a mainland Chinese buyer, was $458,500. “Furniture and works of art and paintings were the target of frenzied bidding on the telephone, the Internet, and overseas,” according to Bonhams. ‘An International Problem’ The Bonhams sale follows a trend of increasing sales to Chinese buyers. According to a report released in March by the European Fine Art Fair (TEFAF), China overtook the United States last year as the world’s biggest market for art and antiques. But the Chinese market may not be what it seems. One report in March indicates that Sotheby’s lost about $22 million from canceled sales between 2008 and 2011. Sotheby’s eventually had to take the delinquent bidders to court, filing nine lawsuits in Hong Kong, according to court papers cited by Bloomberg. “It’s an international problem,” Roger Keverne, a dealer who specializes in Chinese ceramics and works of art, told Bloomberg. “Some Chinese dealers are trying to sell things before they pay for them. We don’t know the full extent of it. The concern is that they can also be the under bidders. They push prices up. It isn’t a genuine market.” The Epoch Times publishes in 35 countries and in 19 languages. Subscribe to our e-newsletter.

When I'm working the drawer front lays under the pull out. The magnetic catch holds the drawer front in place when I'm not working.

(Hoshang Hashimi/AFP via Getty Images)By Jack Phillips8/12/2021Updated: 8/12/2021PrintThe Taliban terrorist group captured the strategic Afghan city of Ghazni, the capital of a province of the same name, fewer than 100 miles from Kabul.A spokesperson for the Taliban wrote on Twitter that the city was taken over, including the police headquarters, a prison, and the governor’s office. The sacking of Ghazni represents the 10th city taken over by the group in about a week amid international fears that the group could take Kabul—and the entirety of Afghanistan—in only a few weeks.Ghazni was taken over by the militant group on Thursday after lengthy fighting, said Nasir Ahmad Faqiri, the head of Ghazni provincial council, according to CNN.The militant group, which seeks to impose a strict form of Sharia law, was deposed in the early 2000s after the United States invaded the Central Asian country. Last month, the Biden administration announced it would pull the remaining U.S. forces from Afghanistan, and recent statements from President Joe Biden and various White House officials suggest Americans won’t attempt to aid the Afghan government in its fight against the Taliban.Ghazni is considered by analysts to be a strategically important area in Afghanistan, as it is located on a key road between Kabul and Kandahar city.The al Qaeda terrorist network—blamed for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks—has long had a presence in the province, according to the Long War Journal, which has, for decades, chronicled the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Just last year, a senior al Qaeda leader, Husam Abd-al-Ra’uf, was killed in a military raid in Ghazni and was later confirmed by U.S. military officials.Separately, the Taliban in recent days said they had seized airports outside the cities of Kunduz and Sheberghan in the north and Farah in the west, making it even more difficult to supply government forces. They said they had also captured the provincial headquarters in Lashkar Gah, the capital of the southern province of Helmand, a hotbed of militant activity.Photos and video footage uploaded online also show apparent Taliban members holding U.S.-provided M-16 rifles, Humvees, and Ford trucks. In one instance, Taliban militants were seen standing next to a seized Soviet-era Mi-35 Hind attack helicopter at the Kunduz airport, although it’s not clear if the helicopter still works or if Taliban forces are able to pilot it.The Taliban, however, risk isolating the country if they do seize overall control. “Attempts to monopolize power through violence, fear, and war will only lead to international isolation,” the charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy, Ross Wilson, said on Twitter.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, said Berlin would not provide financial support to Afghanistan if the Taliban take over and introduce sharia religious law.Reuters contributed to this report.

It is also packed with healthy vegetables for you, including aubergine, carrot, spring onions and red cabbage. By pre marinading your aubergine the night before you can have dinner on the table in no time. The longer you leave your aubergine to marinade the more amazing and deep the asian flavours will sink into your pieces.I served this dish with some crunchy raw vegetables, which worked so well against the deep and salty marinade sauce.Apart from easily cooking up some rice on the side, the thing i love most about this dish is there is only one main part to cook, as your veg is served raw. Making this dish a great meal to cook on a busy midweek evening.The aubergine is the real star of this dish, as it has the ability to take on such a powerful flavour. Think of it as being the tofu of the vegetable world. An excellent meat replacement which is normally in don buri. Its an amazing vegetable as it keeps its structural integrity, whilst also being silky, meaty, and utterly delicious texture.This dish really is a showstopper!

(Reuters/Thomas Mukoya)By Reuters8/12/2017Updated: 8/12/2017PrintNAIROBI/KISUMU, Kenya—Kenyan police killed at least 11 people in a crackdown on protests as anger at the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta erupted in the western city of Kisumu and slums ringing the capital, officials and witnesses said on Saturday.The bodies of nine young men shot dead overnight in Nairobi’s Mathare slum had been brought to the city morgue, a security official told Reuters. The men were killed during police anti-looting operations, the official added.Separately, a young girl in Mathare was killed by police firing “sporadic shots”, a witness said. The run-down neighborhood is loyal to 72-year-old opposition leader Raila Odinga, whose party rejected Tuesday’s vote as a “charade”.Supporters of opposition leader Raila Odinga run away from police during clashes in Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya, August 12, 2017. (Reuters/Goran Tomasevic)A Reuters reporter in Kisumu, center of post-election ethnic violence a decade ago in which 1,200 people died nationwide, said tear gas and live rounds were fired. One man had been killed, a government official said.The unrest erupted moments after Kenya’s election commission announced late on Friday that Kenyatta, 55, had secured a second five-year term in office, despite opposition allegations that the tally was a fraud.Interior Minister Fred Matiang'i said the trouble was localized and blamed it on “criminal elements” rather than legitimate political protest.Red Cross members stands near protesters supporting opposition leader Raila Odinga in Mathare, in Nairobi, Kenya August 12, 2017. (Reuters/Thomas Mukoya)Odinga’s NASA coalition provided no evidence for its rejection of the result. Kenya’s main monitoring group, ELOG, said on Saturday its tally matched the official outcome, undermining NASA’s allegations of fraud.In addition to the deaths, Kisumu’s main hospital was treating four people for gunshot wounds and six who had been beaten by Kenyan police, its records showed.One man, 28-year-old Moses Oduor, was inside his home in the impoverished district of Obunga when police conducting house-to-house raids dragged him out of his bedroom and beat him with clubs.A woman cries as she stand behind policemen during clashes between supporter of opposition leader Raila Odinga and policemen in Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya, August 12, 2017.

She came outside screaming at the police, asking why they are beating people,” his brother, Charles Ochieng said, speaking on behalf of a dazed Oduor.More shooting was heard outside the hospital on Saturday morning. In Nairobi, armed police units backed by water cannon moved through the rubble-strewn streets of Kibera, another pro-Odinga slum.‘Criminal Elements’Interior minister Matiang'i defended the police against accusations of brutality.“Let us be honest - there are no demonstrations happening,” he told reporters.“Individuals or gangs that are looting shops, that want to endanger lives, that are breaking into people’s businesses – those are not demonstrators. They are criminals. And we expect police to deal with criminals how criminals should be dealt with.”Supporters of opposition leader Raila Odinga shout during clashes in Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya, August 12, 2017. (Reuters/Goran Tomasevic)As with previous votes in 2007 and 2013, this year’s elections have exposed the underlying ethnic tensions in the nation of 45 million, the economic engine of East Africa and the region’s main trading hub.In particular, Odinga’s Luo tribe, who hail from the west, had hoped an Odinga presidency would have broken the Kikuyu and Kalenjin dominance of central government since independence in 1963. Kenyatta, son of Kenya’s first president, is a Kikuyu.Even before the declaration, Odinga’s NASA coalition had rejected the outcome, saying the election commission’s systems had been hacked, the count was irregular and foreign observers who gave the poll a clean bill of health were biased.NASA provided no evidence for any of its accusations but singled out former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and former South African president Thabo Mbeki—who both led teams of election observers—for criticism.Anti riot policemen attempt to disperse protesters, supporting opposition leader Raila Odinga, in Mathare, in Nairobi, Kenya August 12, 2017. (Reuters/Thomas Mukoya)Top Odinga lieutenant James Orengo said NASA would not challenge the results in court—as Odinga did when he lost in 2013—but hinted at mass action by praising the history of Kenyans in standing up to previous “stolen” elections.“Going to court is not an option. We have been there before,” Orengo told reporters.In addition to the thumbs-up from foreign monitors, Kenya’s ELOG domestic observation group, which had 8,300 agents on the ground, published a parallel vote tally on Saturday that conformed with the official results.ELOG’s projected outcome put Kenyatta on 54 percent with a 1.9 percent error margin - compared to an official tally of 54.3 percent.“We did not find anything deliberately manipulated,” ELOG chairwoman Regina Opondo said.By Katharine Houreld and Maggie Fick Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowReutersAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesDollar on Track for 5th Straight Weekly Gain, Yen FragileFeb 16, 2024Oil Slips as Weaker IEA Demand Outlook Offsets Rate Cut HopesFeb 16, 20242 Fans Came to See Kansas City Chiefs; They Stopped Suspected ShooterFeb 15, 2024Wall Street Opens Flat After Mixed Economic DataFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

Now, a study suggests that if we do have hypertension, we should be more worried about what happens to our blood pressure when we stand up.Normally, our systolic blood pressure — the “top” number that indicates how much pressure blood exerts against artery walls when the heart beats — dips slightly when we stand. So, scientists wondered if an abnormal response — rising systolic blood pressure upon standing — might serve as an early warning sign for future cardiac events like heart attacks and strokes.Scientists were surprised to discover that even a slight uptick in blood pressure when standing up could make these events more apt to happen among young and middle-aged adults.“This finding may warrant starting blood-pressure-lowering treatment, including medicines earlier in patients with exaggerated blood pressure response to standing,” says lead study author Paolo Palatini, MD, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Padova in Italy.Comparing Sitting Versus Standing ReadingsResearchers took sitting, standing, and lying position blood pressure measurements for 1,207 young and middle-aged adults who had what’s known as stage 1 hypertension, which is defined as was defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 to 159 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure — the “bottom” number that shows how much pressure blood exerts on artery walls when the heart rests between beats — of 90 to 100 mmHg.None of the participants had ever taken blood pressure medication, and none of them had risk factors for heart attacks and strokes like type two diabetes, kidney disease, or heart disease. After an average follow-up period of 17 years, researchers identified 105 cases major cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.Significant Increase in Risk of Heart Attack or StrokeThe 10 percent of participants with the biggest spike in blood pressure upon standing were almost twice as likely to experience events like heart attacks and strokes by the end of the study, according to the study, published March 17 in Hypertension. These people had average systolic blood pressure increases of 11.4 mmHg upon standing, and all of them experienced increases greater than 6.5 mmHg.Among all the others in the study, systolic blood pressure dipped by an average of 3.8 mmHg when they stood up.Interestingly, the people with the biggest blood pressure increases upon standing had similar cardiovascular risk profiles to others in the study in many ways — they had similar activity levels, similar weight profiles, and similar family histories when it came to cardiovascular events.People with the biggest standing blood pressure spikes were, however, more likely to smoke. On the other side of the ledger, they tended to have lower total cholesterol levels as well as lower levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol.One limitation of the study is that it included only white people and most of the participants were male. Results might be different for women or for people from other racial or ethnic groups.Multiple Measurements May Be NeededEven so, the findings suggest that patients may need multiple blood pressure measurements seated and standing to better identify individuals who have an increased risk for heart attacks and strokes, particularly among younger adults.After adjusting for average blood pressure taken over 24 hours, an exaggerated blood pressure response to standing remained an independent predictor of adverse heart events or stroke.“The results of the study confirmed our initial hypothesis — a pronounced increase in blood pressure from lying to standing could be prognostically important in young people with high blood pressure,” Dr. Palatini says. “We were rather surprised that even a relatively small increase in standing blood pressure was predictive of major cardiac events in the long run.”NEWSLETTERSSign up for our Heart Health Newsletter!Enter your emailSubscribeBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

(Drew Downs/U.S. Geological Survey via AP)By The Associated Press12/14/2022Updated: 12/14/2022PrintHONOLULU—U.S. scientists declared Tuesday that two active Hawaii volcanoes—one where lava destroyed hundreds of homes in 2018 and another where lava recently stalled before reaching a crucial Big Island highway—have stopped erupting.“Kilauea is no longer erupting,” the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said in a statement Tuesday, followed by a separate one saying, “Mauna Loa is no longer erupting.”Alert levels for both volcanoes were reduced from watch to advisory.Mauna Loa, the world’s largest volcano, began spewing molten rock Nov. 27 after being quiet for 38 years, drawing onlookers to take in the incandescent spectacle, and setting some nerves on edge early on among people who’ve lived through destructive eruptions.It was Mauna Loa’s longest period of repose, said Ken Hon, the observatory’s scientist in charge.Lava-viewers in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park enjoyed the added rare marvel of being able to see Mauna Loa’s smaller neighbor, Kilauea, erupting at the same time.Kilauea had been erupting since September 2021. A 2018 Kilauea eruption destroyed more than 700 residences.Mauna Loa lava didn’t pose a threat to any communities, but got within 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers) of a major highway that connects the east and west sides of the island.Hon called the two-week spectacle, which is a typical timespan for Mauna Loa, “my favorite eruption.”“It was a beautiful eruption, and lots of people got to see it, and it didn’t take out any major infrastructure and most importantly, it didn’t affect anybody’s life,” he said at a briefing Tuesday.Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Talmadge Magno said a one-way route that opened to manage traffic from throngs of people watching the lava would close Thursday.Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano, background, towers over the summit crater of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island on April 25, 2019. (Caleb Jones/AP Photo)Magno and other county officials had warned that slow-moving lava could force the closure of Saddle Road, also known as Route 200 or Daniel K. Inouye Highway. That prompted motorists to brace for upheaval from a closure that could add hours to commute times on alternate coastal routes.“Whatever it is — luck, chance — this is probably the best situation that we could ask for from Mauna Loa,” Magno said.For Native Hawaiians, volcanic eruptions have deep cultural and spiritual significance. During Mauna Loa’s eruption, many Hawaiians took part in cultural traditions, such as singing, chanting and dancing to honor Pele, the deity of volcanoes and fire, and leaving offerings known as “hookupu.”Lava supply to a Mauna Loa fissure ceased on Saturday, the observatory said, and volcanic tremor and earthquakes associated with the eruption “greatly diminished.”“Spots of incandescence may remain near the vent, along channels, and at the flow front for days or weeks as the lava flows cool,” the observatory’s activity summary said. “However, eruptive activity is not expected to return based on past eruptive behavior.”Lava supply to Kilauea’s Halemaʻumaʻu lava lake ceased on Friday, the observatory said: “Potential remains for resumption of this eruption or initiation of a new eruption at or near the summit of Kilauea.”The observatory will continue monitoring the volcanoes for signs of renewed activity.Despite the definitive statements, Hon said there’s generally a three-month “cooling off” period before scientists consider the eruption over.But there’s been no history of a Mauna Loa rift eruption pausing and restarting, he said, “So we feel pretty confident that this eruption has in fact, paused and is probably over.”It was unclear what connection there could be to the volcanoes stopping their eruptions around the same time. The volcanoes can both be seen at the same time from multiple spots in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park near Kilauea’s caldera.“So, Kilauea may have been diminishing already and the Mauna Loa eruption may have caused enough physical changes to stop it, or it may have just been headed to stop on its own,” Hon said. “So we don’t have a really good answer for that right now.”Scientists will look at data to study the relationship between the two volcanoes, he said.By Jennifer Sinco Kelleher Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowThe Associated PressAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesWorld Shares Follow Wall Street Higher as Japan’s Nikkei Nears Record HighFeb 16, 2024Lyme Disease Case Counts in the US Rose by Almost 70 Percent in 2022 Due to a Change in How It’s ReportedFeb 15, 2024Power Outages Hit Boston Transit System During Morning Rush Hour, Stranding ThousandsFeb 15, 20242 Chinese Fishermen Drown After Chase With Taiwan’s Coast Guard, Which Alleges TrespassingFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsvolcanoHawaiieruptCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

(The Epoch Times)By Henry Jom8/16/2019Updated: 5/20/2020PrintMELBOURNE, Australia—A Hong Kong protest in Melbourne’s CBD turned violent and was cut short after pro-Beijing “thugs” sought to silence event speakers and attendees.At 7 p.m. on Aug. 16, approximately 500 pro-Hong Kong supporters stood peacefully on the steps of Victoria’s State Library in a show of support for a “Stand with Hong Kong-Power to the People” rally organized by the Victoria Hong Kong Tertiary Student Association.In addition to the five demands from Hong Kong protesters, the rally called for two additional demands. Firstly for the UK to declare a Chinese breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, a binding international treaty; and secondly for the U.S. Congress and the UK Parliament to legislate and impose Magnitsky-style sanctions upon the persons responsible for or complicit in the suppression of rights and freedom in Hong Kong.Attendees to the Hong Kong rally exceeded 1000 in Melbourne, Australia on 16 August 2019. (The Epoch Times)Within minutes of starting the rally, pro-Beijing demonstrators gathered next to the group in approximately equal numbers, chanting slogans and playing music, with some demonstrators then resorting to scuffles and shoves in order to vent their frustrations on the protesters.Some members of the press were also attacked.Footage captured shows an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) cameraman attacked by a pro-Beijing demonstrator who sought to damage a camera—the demonstrator was then pulled back and restrained by bystanders.As clashes between both sides intensified, Victoria police formed a barricade between both groups, however, the chanting and shouting from both sides continued.Unified chants from the pro-Hong Kong side such as “We will not give in,” “Stand with Hong Kong,” and “Free Hong Kong” could be heard while on the pro-Beijing side, “One China,” as well as other slogans, were heard.Appalling BehaviourRichard Bradford, a retired I.T. professional, was appalled by the behavior demonstrated by the pro-Beijing group.“It’s disappointing to see a small group over there pretending to support mainland China when they’re really supporting a small band of violent thugs,” Bradford told The Epoch Times.“Unfortunately, the small group of thugs in China have already proven themselves as violent suppressors. They’re doing nasty things over in the Uyghur territory, they’re still trying to bully Taiwan, they are bullying the people up in Tibet.”Richard Bradford, a retired IT professional, attended the Hong Kong rally in Melbourne, Australia on 16 August 2019. (The Epoch Times)Ruan (Frank) Jie, an editor at Tiananmen Times, said that the Chinese consulate was most likely behind the pro-Beijing demonstrators who have been “taught the wrong things.”“They come here, they don’t know how to pay respect to the freedom of the other people, and they don’t know how to respect the other group of people,” Frank told The Epoch Times.“These people are very rude. You can see they are very aggressive.”Ruan (Frank) Jie, an editor at Tiananmen Times, attended the Hong Kong rally in Melbourne, Australia on 16 August 2019. (The Epoch Times)Security ConcernsDue to security concerns, the rally was shortened to only a few speeches made by event organizers and from members of the public, cutting the scheduled rally time by half. By 9:30 p.m. local time, pro-Hong Kong protesters left the event with pro-Beijing demonstrators still chanting slogans.“In the face of excessive violence, and unlawful oppression from the police, most of the indiscriminate attacks from the gangs, defamation against the protesters from the government, Hong Kongers are still trying their very best to protect our last line of defense, our judicial system,” a spokesperson at the rally said.An attendee to a Hong Kong rally holds a yellow Free Hong Kong umbrella in Melbourne, Australia on 16 August 2019. (The Epoch Times)Despite no reported injuries, Victoria Police confirmed to the ABC that two men were interviewed regarding unlawful assault, before being released pending summons.The rally in Melbourne follows other Hong Kong rallies held on the same day in Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide.

A rowing machine offers a full body workout targeting the upper body muscles, as well as the quads, calves, and glutes.iStock (4)Are there benefits for choosing an elliptical over a treadmill if you’re getting your cardio at the gym?When you’re working toward getting in the 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, you might make a beeline for the cardio equipment at the gym.And you might also be wondering, with all the options — treadmill, exercise bike, elliptical, stair climber, rower, and sometimes more — if you’re choosing the right one.“Each piece of cardio equipment has its pros and cons,” says Greg Summerville, MD, a sports medicine physician at the UNC School of Medicine in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. These pros and cons are, however, different for everyone.Dr. Summerville works with patients to create exercise prescriptions for his patients, and takes a range of factors into account, such as age, function, and mobility, as well as existing health conditions or injuries. Those things all make a difference when it comes to which machine is best for you — as do your specific fitness goals.All of these aforementioned cardio machines are designed to improve cardiovascular health, meaning it increases your heart and respiratory rate to strengthen your heart muscle and build endurance. But some also build strength, Summerville says. So, think about what you want out of your workout. Are you there for a strict cardio workout or one that combines cardio and strength, for instance?Answering questions like that will help you pick the appropriate machine for you. Also, if you have any disability, injuries, or other health issues that could interfere with your ability to safely exercise — or use one of these machines — talk to your doctor or healthcare provider before starting a new exercise routine.And finally, if you’re going to get your cardio in at the gym using one of these machines, pick one that you like using (so long as you can safely do so). Finding a workout you enjoy doing makes it that much easier to come back to and stick with. After all, the movement you do (whatever that looks like) is better than some “perfect” workout you don’t do.Here’s a rundown of some common cardio machines and their specific pros and cons:TreadmillWhat It Is A machine with an endless moving belt for walking or running. “I’d call this the bread-and-butter of cardio machines,” says Araceli De Leon, an ACE-certified personal trainer and health coach.Muscles Targeted The treadmill primarily helps build your cardiovascular endurance, says De Leon, but walking or running will also work the lower body muscles, including the quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings, and calves, according to ACSM. It’s not the most effective way to build these muscles, but using the treadmill will help to maintain them, Summerville adds.Perks You can adjust the speed and incline to increase intensity or perform an interval or HIIT workout, says De Leon. Compared with the elliptical and rower, a treadmill has been found to burn more fat, according to a study published in 2021 in the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine. (It’s worth noting that that study only included nine men and no women.)Considerations Being on your phone and looking down or looking up at a TV in the gym can strain your neck, says De Leon. Also, walking too close to the console or holding onto the rails can affect your body’s walking cycle. Try to stay in the middle of the belt and avoid holding on, she says. (If you can’t safely use a treadmill without holding on, then another machine may be a better option. See below.) The treadmill can also be a higher impact activity. Though running or walking on a treadmill is not as hard on the joints as running on concrete, says Summerville, exercising on a track or turf outside will be a more joint-friendly form of exercise.Exercise BikeWhat It Is Indoor or stationary exercise bikes come in a variety of styles, such as an air bike (where pedaling pushes air through the wheel, providing resistance), a spin or indoor bike (where you can manually adjust resistance), and a recumbent bike (where you sit in an reclined position), among others.Muscles Targeted Your quads and hamstrings are the workhorses while cycling. Using a stationary bike can also build lower-body muscle. “By increasing the resistance, you can also get a significant strength-building workout with your cardio,” says Summerville.Perks On certain styles of bike, you can increase the resistance and stand up to pedal, which simulates climbing a hill, Summerville says. He also recommends indoor bicycling to those who are recovering from lower-extremity injuries. If you have balance problems, a stationary bike is a good option for you, since your feet are in one fixed position (as opposed to a treadmill or stair machine).Considerations While it’s low-impact and easy on the joints, if you have anterior knee pain (pain in the front of the knee), Summerville recommends moving to the elliptical, as the pedaling motion on the bike may put too much force on the knee.Elliptical MachineWhat It Is An elliptical is a stationary machine with two large pedals that move in a circular motion through space, as well as handlebars that move back and forth. You use the elliptical standing up.Muscles Targeted Quads, hamstrings, and calves are all worked during this type of exercise, particularly if the resistance is increased. Without using a challenging resistance, this is mostly a cardio workout, says Summerville.Perks As a low-impact workout, the elliptical is ideal for beginners, as well as people recovering from injury or in physical therapy, says De Carlo. “There is no pounding; your feet never leave the pedals that they’re on,” she says. An elliptical (as well as rower, below) can also be an option for those with physical disabilities, such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine study notes.Considerations Avoid hunching, lifting your heels, or leaning too far back, all common mistakes De Leon sees on the elliptical. “Maintain the proper center of gravity on the machine,” she says.Stair ClimberWhat It Is A stair climber, much like the name implies, is a machine that simulates walking up steps. There are many types of stair climbers, such as a step mill (revolving, escalator-like stairs), stair stepper (which has one pedal for each foot that you step on), or vertical climbers (ladder-like steppers).Muscles Targeted “The stair stepper really activates the glutes, quads, and calves,” says Summerville. A step mill–style climber will be more of a cardio-based workout (you adjust the speed), while a stair stepper allows you to adjust the resistance, which will be more muscle strengthening, he says.Perks Stair climbing is usually a high-intensity workout. As such, the stair stepper offers one of the highest calorie-burning cardio machines, Summerville notes.Considerations Because it’s a higher-intensity exercise, you may not be able to do this type of workout for as long a duration as a less intense workout.If you have knee or hip problems, a stair machine may aggravate that pain, and Summerville recommends using an elliptical instead. On a step mill, it can be common to use the handrails to support your weight and take some work off your legs, but this can put too much pressure on shoulders and wrists, De Leon points out. If you’re struggling to keep up with the machine, decrease the speed.Rowing MachineWhat It Is A rowing machine is one where you sit on a sliding seat and use both hands to pull a handle to move you back and forth, mimicking a rowing motion.Muscles Targeted Muscles of the upper back and shoulders, quads, calves, and glutes get worked during the pushback and pull phase.Perks The rower can be a one-stop shop. “It’s a total-body conditioning machine. You get cardio, as well as upper and lower body strengthening,” says Summerville. You can also adjust it to get the workout you’re looking for. For instance, by turning down the resistance, the workout becomes mostly cardio; increasing the resistance will provide more muscle activation, he says. Rowing is also a low-impact activity, meaning it’s easy on joints.Considerations It may seem intimidating if you’ve never used one, but once you get the hang of the push-pull rowing motion, you’ll feel more confident. Start at the lowest resistance first and increase it as you become more comfortable on the machine (and as your stamina improves).NEWSLETTERSSign up for our Healthy Living Newsletter!Enter your emailSubscribeBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

(AAP Image/Supplied by Steven Clarke/via REUTERS)By Reuters3/3/2019Updated: 3/3/2019PrintSYDNEY—Firefighters battled 25 blazes across the Australian state of Victoria on Sunday as a record-breaking heatwave delivered the hottest start to March on record for the southern third of the country.The continent is prone to deadly blazes thanks to its combination of remote terrain, high summer temperatures and flammable eucalyptus bush.A severe four-day heatwave has brought fire weather across the southern parts of Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania over the weekend.The south-eastern state of Victoria was the worst hit, with more than 2,000 firefighters, water-bombing aircraft and volunteers battling blazes on Sunday.A cool change was forecast for late on Sunday but an associated wind change would bring danger for firefighters.“It’s a dangerous time, putting it bluntly,” Victoria’s Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said in a televised emergency briefing on Sunday.“Not just for communities but for firefighters.”An experienced firefighter told local media that the the blaze is worse than the Black Saturday fires that burned in the same spot ten years ago.The Black Saturday fires had been the worst bushfires on record and destroyed thousands of homes in Victoria, killing 173 people and injuring 414 on a day.“Under those very strong conditions experienced on that day (in 2009), it travelled neatly, whilst it damaged some property it was a very narrow finger compared to what we’re facing with this fire, because this fire has been growing,” Country Fire Authority assistant chief officer Trevor Owen told a community meeting in Pakenham on Sunday.“What we’ve been doing is throwing everything we’ve got at the fire.”“We are confirming there are three structure losses, it does appear that they could be homes,” Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp told local reporters.“This is an active fire, it is moving, and there is every likelihood there will be further property losses.” A wind change is making its way across the state and will present new challenges for fire crews.“It is a dangerous time, putting it bluntly. Not just for communities, but for firefighters, and we’re very conscious of the safety of our firefighters and we will message in relation to that,” Crisp said.At a press conference alongside Mr Crisp, Premier Daniel Andrews told people to follow warnings from authorities.“Don’t put yourself in harm’s way and potentially add to the already considerable workload our firefighters have,” he said.There are more than 30 other fires still burning across Victoria.The largest fire in Bunyip State Park was sparked by multiple lightning strikes on Friday.Rural townships were evacuated with no reported injuries or deaths, but three homes and several properties had been destroyed by noon on Sunday.The hot and windy conditions are expected to linger until Wednesday.By Alison Bevege with reporting by Australian Associated Press Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowReutersAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesDollar on Track for 5th Straight Weekly Gain, Yen FragileFeb 16, 2024Oil Slips as Weaker IEA Demand Outlook Offsets Rate Cut HopesFeb 16, 20242 Fans Came to See Kansas City Chiefs; They Stopped Suspected ShooterFeb 15, 2024Wall Street Opens Flat After Mixed Economic DataFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsAustraliabushfiresvictoriaCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

Our laboratory has observed that these effects are often age-specific in rats. For instance, whereas moderate to high doses of the dopamine agonist apomorphine increase locomotion, suppressed locomotor activity is seen following low dose exposure, with this low dose effect not emerging consistently until adolescence. A somewhat earlier emergence of a low dose “paradoxical” effect is seen with the 5HT1a receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, with late preweanling, but not neonatal, rats showing increases in ingestive behavior at low doses but suppression at higher doses. In contrast to these ontogenetic increases in expression of low dose drug effects, low dose facilitation of social behavior is seen following ethanol only in adolescent rats and not their mature counterparts, although suppression of social interactions at higher doses is seen at both ages. This hormesis-like low dose stimulation appears related in part to overcompensation, with brief social suppression preceding the subsequent stimulation response, and also bears a number of ontogenetic similarities to acute tolerance, a well characterized, rapidly emerging adaptation to ethanol. Implications of these and other ontogenetic findings for studies of hormesis are discussed.Hormesis is a dose-response relatifonship characterized by a low-dose response that is in the opposite direction from that seen at higher doses (Calabrese & Baldwin, 2002a). Although best characterized in the toxicology literature, examples of hormesis-like dose-response relationships also abound in pharmacology (Calabrese & Baldwin, 2001). Little attention has been directed thus far to hormesis from a developmental perspective. Several examples of hormesis-like phenomena appearing during ontogeny will be discussed here, with a particular focus on developmental psychopharmacology. Examples will be given of both delayed ontogenetic emergence of low dose effects as well as an ontogenetic decline in a hormetic-like low dose effect with ethanol. Evidence will be presented to show that the low dose stimulatory effect on social behavior seen in adolescent rats following ethanol administration is preceded by a short-lasting initial disruption in homeostasis in the opposite direction, evidence consistent with an overcompensatory hormetic response. Several other ontogenetic examples from the literature will also be presented that raise the broader issue of whether variation in expression of hormesis across different models/challenges might result in part from different starting positions on U-shaped perturbation/response functions reflecting altered levels of baseline adaptation due to prior developmental history and ongoing exposure to related challenges naturally occurring in the environment.ONTOGENY AND HORMESIS: ONTOGENETIC EMERGENCE OF LOW DOSE EFFECTS IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGYIn our ontogenetic investigations, we have seen several examples of the developmental emergence of low dose effects that resemble hormesis. Two examples are given below.Ontogeny of Biphasic Effects of 8-OH-DPAT on Ingestion-Related BehaviorsIn response to the 5HT1a agonist 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), adult rats typically exhibit an increase in ingestion across a dose range from approximately 0.03–1.0 mg/kg (e.g., Hutson et al., 1988), with decreases in ingestion seen at higher doses, perhaps in part related to competitive behaviors associated with the “serotonergic syndrome” that emerge at higher doses (Dourish et al., 1985). This biphasic effect of 8-OH-DPAT on ingestion is not evident in young rat pups but appears later during ontogeny. In neonatal rats, only inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT were observed on independent ingestion when assessed across doses ranges from 0.5–10 mg/kg (Kirstein & Spear, 1988; Frambes et al., 1990) and 0.01–1 mg/kg (Spear et al., 1991). As shown in the top panel in Fig. 1, beginning at the lowest effective dose of 8-OH-DPAT, only a suppression in mouthing was seen in neonatal (postnatal day [P] 3–4) rat pups. In contrast, P17–18 preweanlings exhibited both a low dose stimulatory and high dose depressant effect of 8-OH-DPAT on mash-related ingestive behaviors (see Fig. 1, middle panel). In young adolescent (P28–29) animals, an increase in ingestion was seen only at the highest dose (lower panel of Fig. 1); given that none of the doses within this relatively low dose range were sufficient to yield signs of the serotonergic syndrome, it is likely that this dose range was below that necessary to induce the decreases in ingestion expected at sufficiently high doses.FIGURE 1 Acute effects of various doses of the 5HT1a agonist 8-OH-DPAT administered subcutaneously on behavioral measures of ingestion of P3–4 (top panel), P17–18 (middle panel) and P28–29 (bottom panel) Sprague-Dawley rat pups. P3–4 pups were injected with 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 or 1 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT 10 min. prior to a 5 min. ingestion test conducted in a test incubator with warm Half and Half dairy cream puddled on the terry cloth covered floor; mouthing exhibited by each pup during the test was determined using time sampling. Preweanling (P17–18) and post-weanling (P28–29) animals were injected with 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg of the test drug immediately prior to a 25 min. ingestion test, with time spent at dishes containing wet mash and milk determined (note: time spent at the milk dish was low in all groups at both ages, and hence only mash data are summarized here). Data shown here were derived from Spear et al. (1991).Ontogenetic differences in the effective doses necessary for inducing specific drug effects—such as the notable shift in effective stimulatory dose seen between P17–18 and P28–29—may reflect potential age differences in drug distribution/metabolism. It is difficult, however, for pharmacodynamic considerations to contribute to the delayed ontogenetic emergence of biphasic effects, assuming that appropriate dose ranges to detect biphasic effects were examined at each age, as we attempted to do in our work with 8-OH-DPAT in neonatal rat pups (Kirstein & Spear, 1988; Frambes et al., 1990; Spear et al., 1991). Given that low doses of 8-OH-DPAT have been suggested to increase feeding via preferential stimulation of 5HT1a autoreceptors (e.g., see Dourish et al., 1988), these data were hypothesized to support the delayed ontogenetic emergence of functional 5HT1a autoreceptors, with low dose stimulation of ingestion evident in late preweanling, but not neonatal, rat pups (see Spear, et al., 1991, for discussion). Interpretation of these data within a hormesis context is given below, following a discussion of another study that also yielded a delayed ontogenetic emergence of a low dose, potentially autoreceptor-mediated drug effect.Ontogeny of Low Dose Effects of ApomorphineReminiscent of the 8-OH-DPAT findings, a delayed ontogenetic emergence of a low dose effect was also observed in the dopaminergic system. At high doses, the dopamine agonist apomorphine stimulates locomotor activity, whereas a suppression in activity is typically seen within a narrow low dose range (Shalaby & Spear, 1980). This low dose suppressant effect emerges only slowly during ontogeny. For instance, as shown in Fig. 2, whereas stimulant effects of apomorphine on locomotor activity were evident at all ages, a low dose suppression of locomotor movements emerged only in adolescents at the oldest age examined in this study (P35) (Shalaby & Spear, 1980). Although this study was conducted using fewer doses than desirable to fully characterize this effect, other laboratories have likewise reported the emergence of the low dose suppressant effect of DA receptor agonists only around the time of adolescence in rats (Hedner & Lundborg, 1985; Van Hartesveldt et al., 1994). Reminiscent of the 8-OH-DPAT data, these low doses suppressant effects have been postulated to reflect delayed maturation of inhibitory DA autoreceptors in mesolimbic brain regions, although data supporting this hypothesis (Shalaby et al., 1981; Spear & Brake, 1983) are not ubiquitous, with some recent work not supporting this suggestion (Franz & Van Hartesveldt, 1995; Andersen et al., 1997).FIGURE 2 Acute effects of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on number of locomotor movements in the open field in preweanling (P7, P14), weanling (P21), early adolescent (P28), and mid-adolescent (P35) Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were given the drugs subcutaneously and were tested beginning 1 min. following injection for 20 min. in size-adjusted open field chambers. The number of 5 sec. time bouts (sampled every 15 sec.) where locomotor movements were exhibited by each animal was determined. Data are derived from Shalaby and Spear (1980).Do These Low Dose Effects Reflect Hormesis?In a number of respects, the low dose response that emerges gradually during ontogeny with apomorphine and 8-OH-DPAT resembles hormesis. In both instances, typical (albeit reciprocal) versions of hormetic dose-response curves (see Calabrese & Baldwin, 2002a) eventually emerge developmentally, with the low dose effect in the opposite direction from that seen at higher doses. With both drugs, the low dose effects that emerged ontogenetically were reliable and of a magnitude (55–85% change from control) typical of hormetic responses. Whether or not these low dose effects meet the “adaptive benefit” component sometimes linked to hormesis (e.g., Calabrese & Baldwin, 2001) is doubtful, and indeed considerations of adaptive significance of low dose effects would appear to have more applicability in toxicology than pharmacology.With both apomorphine and 8-OH-DPAT, the ontogenetic emergence of low dose effects of these drugs seem to provide an example of the delayed ontogeny of hormesis or a hormesis-like response relative to effects evident at higher doses. From these two examples, however, it should not be concluded that hormetic-like responses are necessarily less likely to be expressed in younger than more mature animals. Indeed, the data discussed in the following section document a hormetic-like low dose effect present in younger animals but not apparent in adults.ETHANOL AND SOCIAL FACILITATION IN ADOLESCENCE: AGE-SPECIFIC HORMESIS OF THE OVERCOMPENSATION TYPE?More recently, a major focus of our laboratory has been on ontogeny of ethanol responsiveness, with particular attention paid to the adolescent period. Ethanol has been shown to exhibit evidence for hormesis using a variety of dependent measures ranging from locomotion to effects on liver, kidney, and cardiac function (Calabrese & Baldwin, 2003). We have also observed a striking example of a hormesis-like effect in our work examining the effects of ethanol on social facilitation in adolescent rats (Varlinskaya et al., 2001; Varlinskaya & Spear, 2002). For testing of social behavior, each experimental rat is placed in a familiar test situation in the presence of a non-manipulated, unfamiliar age mate. Social interactions of the experimental animal over the 10 min. period are videotaped and later analyzed for incidence of a variety of social behaviors, including social investigation, contact behavior, and play behavior. When P30 adolescent rats are given a variety of different doses of ethanol 30 min. pre-test, a biphasic dose-response curve is revealed, with low doses of ethanol increasing overall social activity, and higher doses suppressing social behavior (Fig. 3) (Varlinskaya et al., 2001). The low dose facilitation of social behavior by ethanol is specific to social interactions; as shown in Fig. 4, no facilitation is evident when adolescents are given the opportunity to interact with an inanimate object (an equivalent sized cotton ball) (Varlinskaya et al., 2001). As illustrated in Fig. 5, this low dose facilitation is age specific, and is not evident in adult (P70) rats, despite similarities in blood alcohol levels across age (Fig. 6) (Varlinskaya & Spear, 2002). The ontogenetic decline of this low dose facilitation occurs late in the adolescent period, an age range conservatively defined as the interval from P28 to P42 in rats, based on timing of neurobehavioral discontinuities and pubertal-associated changes (see Spear, 2000, for discussion). As shown in Fig. 7, a low dose facilitation of ethanol-induced social interactions is significant at doses of 0.5 and 0.75 g/kg in early (P28) adolescents and at a dose of 0.5 g/kg in mid (P35) adolescents, but does not reach significance at P42, although social suppression is seen at higher doses at all ages (Varlinskaya & Spear, 2004).FIGURE 3 Acute effects of ethanol on overall social activity of P30 adolescent rats. Overall social activity was scored as the sum of social investigation, contact, and play behavior frequencies. Animals were tested 30 min. following intragastric administration of various doses of ethanol or water (0 dose control). Data are derived from Varlinskaya et al. (2001).FIGURE 4 Acute effects of ethanol on overall activity of adolescent rats directed towards an age mate or towards an inanimate object (cotton ball) 30 min. following intragastric administration of the challenge substance. Data are derived from Varlinskaya et al. (2001).FIGURE 5 Acute effects of ethanol on overall social activity of P35 adolescent and P70 adult rats. Animals were tested under familiar test circumstances in the social interaction test 30 min. following intraperitoneal administration of saline or the test doses of ethanol. Data are derived from Varlinskaya & Spear (2002).FIGURE 6 Blood alcohol levels of P35 adolescent and P70 adult rats determined 30 min. following intraperitoneal administration of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 or 1.0 g/kg ethanol. Data are derived from Varlinskaya & Spear (2002). For the interpretation of these data, it may be useful to consider that 1 drink in humans has been estimated to produce peak blood alcohol levels in the range of 9–25 mg/dl (see Eckardt et al., 1998).FIGURE 7 Acute effects of ethanol on overall social activity of early (P28), mid (P35) and late (P42) adolescent rats. Animals were tested under familiar test circumstances 30 min. following intraperitoneal administration of the challenge doses of ethanol or saline. Data are derived from Valinskaya & Spear, in press.Does this behavior reflect hormesis? The magnitude of the response (about a 30–50% increase over control values) is within the range typical of hormetic responses, and this low dose response is in the expected, opposite direction from the acute ethanol response evident at higher doses. Whether this low dose effect reflects a direct stimulatory response (direct stimulation hormesis) or is the result of an overcompensatory response following an initial homeostatic disruption (overcompensation stimulation hormesis) (see Calabrese & Baldwin, 2002b) is uncertain, although we have some preliminary data that begin to address this question. To the extent that a particular instance of hormesis reflects an overcompensatory response to a disruption in homeostasis, we reasoned that it might be possible to detect a short-lasting precipitating event in the opposite direction from the subsequently appearing overcompensatory response. That is, to the extent that the test circumstances support detection of a brief initiating homeostatic disturbance, a transient initial response should be evident shortly after administration in the opposite direction of the typical low dose effect.Results of a preliminary study where P28 adolescents were tested only 5 min. following intraperitoneal injection of ethanol rather than 30 min. post-challenge as in the studies discussed above revealed significant social suppression after 0.75 g/kg (Fig. 8), a dose that produces social facilitation at 30 min. post-challenge (see Fig.7). These data showing that the low dose social facilitation seen at this age is preceded by a brief excursion from homeostasis in the opposite direction provide evidence consistent with what we would expect with an overcompensatory hormetic response. Data from animals given 0.5 g/kg are more challenging to interpret. The 0.5 g/kg dose was just as effective at stimulating social interactions at the 30 min. test as the 0.75 g/kg dose in P28 animals (see Fig.6), yet no evidence of social suppression was seen at this dose when testing began 5 min. following injection. Thus, whereas the temporal pattern of findings following the 0.75 g/kg dose in these animals supports an overcompensatory interpretation, the data obtained in response to the 0.5 g/kg do not. The latter negative finding is difficult to interpret, of course. It could potentially reflect a direct, rather than overcompensatory, hormetic effect. Alternatively, it is possible that the initial perturbation seen at this lower dose was so short-lived as to escape detection in a 10 min. social interaction test beginning 5 min. following ethanol challenge. These preliminary findings should be interpreted cautiously until data are confirmed and perhaps extended to a briefer post-injection-test interval and shorter test duration. Traditionally we have avoided using shorter tests of social interactions in adolescents given that initial levels of social interaction during this test are sufficiently high as to approach ceiling levels. Yet, use of shorter test periods might prove useful for detecting transient social suppression relatively close to the time of injection.FIGURE 8 Acute effects of ethanol on overall social activity of P28 adolescent rats. Animals were tested under familiar test circumstances 5 min. following intraperitoneal administration of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 or 1.0 g/kg ethanol.If ethanol-induced social facilitation during early and mid adolescence reflects (at least partially) an overcompensatory hormetic response, why might this response decline ontogenetically? Neural mechanisms underlying the ontogenetic decline in expression of ethanol-induced social facilitation during the adolescent period remain to be determined, although work is planned to explore the contribution of mu-opioid receptor systems, given the importance of these receptors in the regulation of social behavior in adolescence (Vanderschuren et al., 1997). One potential clue regarding the apparent ontogenetic decline of this hormetic-like social facilitation following low doses of ethanol is provided by considering the ontogeny of a form of rapid neural adaptation to ethanol that has been termed “acute tolerance”. Acute tolerance is a rapid decline in sensitivity to ethanol that occurs within a single bout of ethanol exposure (see Kalant, 1993, for review). This form of tolerance can be detected in a number of different ways (for review, see Silveri & Spear, 2004), including via an attenuated response to a subsequent high dose challenge shortly following clearance of a lower dose (Ponomarev & Crabbe, 2002). The latter approach is virtually identical to one of the adaptive pharmacological properties cited for hormesis—i.e., that “… a low dose … administered prior to a higher and more threatening dose, often reduces the toxic potential of the subsequent exposure” (Calabrese & Baldwin, 2001, p. 355). Given these similarities, it is of particular interest that the ontogenetic decline in ethanol-induced social facilitation resembles the ontogenetic decline observed in acute tolerance to ethanol, with evidence for acute tolerance (at least to ethanol's sedative effects) seen in adolescent and even younger animals under test circumstances that do not support the emergence of acute tolerance in adults (e.g., Silveri & Spear, 1998; Silveri & Spear, in press). Expression of acute tolerance in young but not adult rats appears related in part to transient developmental overexpression of NMDA receptors, with the NMDA antagonist (+)MK-801 blocking expression of acute tolerance in young animals (Silveri & Spear, 2004).Of course, further work is needed to determine whether ethanol-induced social facilitation in young adolescents represents a hormetic compensatory response, and whether neural substrates underlying this potentially adaptive process and its ontogenetic decline are related in part to those associated with the rapid adaptations termed “acute tolerance”. Yet, even at this early stage of examining hormesis within a developmental context, we hope that the utility of ontogenetic considerations for the study of hormesis has been demonstrated.OTHER ONTOGENETIC EXAMPLES OF HORMESIS-LIKE PHENOMENAMoving beyond the fields of toxicology and pharmacology and the work of our laboratory, other examples of hormesis-like phenomena in the developmental literature emerge. Two examples will be given here as a basis for further discussion.The first example is almost a post-script to a relatively long story examining the consequences of early environmental manipulations, work conducted in the laboratories of Meaney, Plotsky and others (see Ladd et al., 2000, for review). In this work, rodent models were used to examine the effects of early environmental manipulations on later sensitivity to stressors, measured behaviorally as well as in terms of functioning of a stress-sensitive hormonal system called the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The question raised by the Meaney and Plotsky groups was whether daily environmental manipulations of rat pups during much of the preweanling period would alter their later stress responsiveness. These daily manipulations were of two types: 15 min. of maternal separation (typically referred to as “handling” for historical reasons—Denenberg, 1964), or a more extended 3 hr. period of separation. Controls typically consisted of animals that were normally colony-reared, receiving only the amount of stimulation associated with normal colony maintenance (cage cleaning and so on). In some experiments, a non-handled group was also included that was explicitly not manipulated in any way during the treatment period. The basic findings from these experiments were clear: as adults, animals that had received early “handling” exhibited more modulated HPA and behavioral responses to stressors than colony-reared controls, whereas the “separated” animals as adults exhibited intensified responses to stressors when indexed both behaviorally and hormonally (Ladd et al., 2000). Of particular importance for the story here, outcomes evident in the non-handled group were very similar to those of the “separated” group (see Ladd et al., 2000). In other words, the most developmentally perturbed group and the least manipulated group exhibited similar outcomes—a pattern that strikingly resembles hormesis.The second example is drawn from a very different developmental literature, data on human adolescents and risk taking. Although adolescents of a variety of species including humans exhibit more risk taking than is seen at other ages (e.g., Moffitt, 1993), there is variability among adolescents in the amount of risk-taking behaviors. Some human adolescents engage in very little risk taking, many exhibit moderate amounts, and some are extreme risk takers. Evidence suggests that risk taking is not inversely related to adaptiveness, but rather that moderate levels of risk taking may be associated with adaptive competence. For instance, Shedler and Block (1990) found that individuals engaging in occasional drug use during adolescence were more socially competent than either frequent users or abstainers, with the frequent users often characterized as alienated and distressed and the abstainers, anxious, emotionally constricted, and lacking in social skills. This U-shaped relationship between levels of risk taking and social competence provides another example of a hormesis-like response early in development.It is arguable whether these non-pharmacological examples drawn from the developmental literature reflect hormesis per se, or merely hormesis-like patterns. Yet, they raise an interesting issue. Do prototypic controls always—or even normally—start from the zero point on U-shaped hormesis or hormesis-like curves? It has been postulated that hormesis reactions of the overcompensation type function to counter insults that induce even slight perturbations from homeostasis, with the rebound overcompensation seen at low doses serving to protect against continued insult (Calabrese & Baldwin, 2002b). According to this view, it is the overcompensation response, and not the baseline state, that often yields the most beneficial outcome. Yet, it would seem unusual for evolution to have favored so ubiquitously the retention of systems that maximize function not under normal baseline circumstances, but only following modest perturbations from homeostasis. From a slightly different perspective, perhaps the null level exposure to environmental perturbations and stressors is not the normal baseline state, but rather reflects a zero exposure level that can be produced in the laboratory but may not always be realized in a world full of toxins, infections, and stressors in which we and other species live and have evolved. According to this view, hormesis-like responses may have been highly conserved during evolution because of the challenging, unclean, and natural toxin-filled environments in which species have evolved. Animals may not have evolved for life in a vacuum, but rather may have evolved to respond most adaptively to the typically modest levels of ongoing perturbations of their environment associated with exposure to minor toxins, infections, and other stressors. Variation in findings of hormesis across test organism, tissue type, and challenge may reflect in part different levels of baseline adaptation due to developmental history and prior exposure to related challenges naturally occurring in the environment, and hence different starting points on the hypothesized U-shaped (or inverted U-shaped) dose/response function. Consequently, when assessing the prevalence of hormesis-like phenomena and exploring their underlying mechanisms, it may become of increasing importance to consider the ontogeny of these forms of adaptation and the role of developmental history in their expression.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported in part by grants from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism R37 AA12525 and R01 AA12150 to Linda P.

(AAP Image/Mick Tsikas) By Victoria Kelly-Clark9/10/2023Updated: 9/10/2023PrintX 10:00Australia and the Philippines have become strategic partners following a pivotal meeting between the countries’ leaders on Sept. 8.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was honoured to be able to facilitate the ramp-up in ties, which was a historic moment in relations between the two nations and would see both countries work as partners to maintain a stable region.“Australia and the Philippines enjoy a long-standing relationship based on close cooperation and enriched by the 400,000 Australians with Filipino heritage,” he said.“Today is a watershed moment for relations between Australia and the Philippines. Our Strategic Partnership will facilitate closer cooperation between our countries and contribute to an open, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.”The strategic partnership follows the announcement in August that Australia would look to work more closely with the Philippines on defence and security-related issues.“The Philippines is a critical nation for Australia’s interest,” Mr. Albanese said on Sept. 7.Related StoriesAustralia Continues Ramp up of Ties With Philippines9/7/2023Australia to Ramp up Military Ties With the Philippines in South China Sea8/25/2023“We have strong economic relations with the Philippines. We also have strong cooperation when it comes to defence arrangements, and in addition to that, we have a strong diaspora in Australia.”Australia Looking To Elevate TiesThe announcement comes just weeks after Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles announced both countries would work to elevate diplomatic ties to a strategic partnership level.Speaking in Manila on Aug. 25, Mr. Marles said that both countries were very ambitious about “working more closely together, about building our high-end interoperability, about seeing our defence forces become closer.”“We are two countries committed to the global rules-based order. We are committed to an idea of a world in which disputes are determined by reference to international law,” the deputy prime minister said.“Peace is maintained through the protection of deployable rules-based order and its functionality around the world, and in truth, around the world today, we see it under pressure.”Mr. Marles said that he saw Australia’s deepening defence ties with the Philippines as a pathway to upholding the rules-based order“What we will do is bring our military capability to enhance the rules-based order and to provide for its expression,” he said.“And in that sense, what we are about is peace. And so I think that message is as important now as it’s ever been.”China Tensions Create Impetus for Deepening TiesThe deepening military ties between the two nations come as the Philippines is experiencing an increasing ramp-up in tensions with Beijing over its attempt to claim Filippino territories in the South China Sea.In August, the Philippino government condemned a Chinese coast guard ship’s “excessive and offensive” use of a water cannon to block a Filipino supply boat from delivering new troops, food, water, and fuel to the Second Thomas Shoal, a Philippine-occupied territory.Beijing believes it has “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea, as well as most of the islands within it.This would include the Spratly Islands, an archipelago consisting of 100 islands and reefs that sit territorially within the waters of the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan.The confrontation is the latest flare-up between the two countries, which has seen the Chinese Coastguard vessel use military-grade lasers and other methods to deter Filipino naval ships from the disputed regions.The Armed Forces of the Philippines said in a Facebook post that the Chinese ship’s actions were “in wanton disregard of the safety of the people on board” and violated international law, including the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.The “excessive and offensive actions against Philippine vessels” near the shoal prevented one of two Filipino boats from unloading supplies needed by its troops guarding the shoal, the Filipino military said in a statement reported by the Associated Press.It called on the Chinese coast guard and Beijing’s Central Military Commission “to act with prudence and be responsible in their actions to prevent miscalculations and accidents that will endanger people’s lives.” Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowVictoria Kelly-ClarkAuthor FollowVictoria Kelly-Clark is an Australian based reporter who focuses on national politics and the geopolitical environment in the Asia-pacific region, the Middle East and Central Asia.

Doctors say it’s still critical that people continue taking these meds to keep underlying health problems under control.ByDon RaufMedically ReviewedbyJustin Laube, MDon January 12, 2021Everyday Health ArchiveSome prescription medications may increase your risk of getting COVID-19, as well as getting sicker from it.iStock (2)For people taking oral corticosteroids like prednisone (Rayos, Sterapred) on a routine basis for such conditions as asthma, allergies, and arthritis, risk for COVID-19 (and more serious symptoms) may be higher.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, oral and intravenous corticosteroids reduce the activity of the immune system, and people who take them may be at an increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19. Severe illness from COVID-19 is defined as hospitalization, admission to the ICU, intubation or mechanical ventilation, or death.An editorial by endocrinologists and diabetes specialists published in May 2020 in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism warns that people taking oral corticosteroids like prednisone on a routine basis may be unable to mount a normal stress response to the new coronavirus and are at a high risk of doing poorly if they get COVID-19.“Corticosteroids may suppress the immune system, which could increase the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and also could increase the risk that you could get sicker from the infection,” says editorial coauthor Ursula Kaiser, MD, chief of the division of endocrinology, diabetes, and hypertension at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.Raghavendra Mirmira, MD, an editorial coauthor and professor of medicine in the section of endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism at the University of Chicago, says that the advisory applies to individuals who take prednisone (Deltasone), hydrocortisone (Hydrocort), and dexamethasone (Decadron). (Note that corticosteroids are a type of steroid drug, and all of the corticosteroids mentioned belong to a class known as glucocorticoids.)Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1998 to 2006, an estimated 1 percent of people in the United States take these types of oral corticosteroids. Individuals take them for a range of conditions that are inflammatory by nature, including severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, chronic allergies, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), vasculitis (an inflammation of the blood vessels), and lupus.Another group of people taking oral corticosteroids are those with an adrenal insufficiency disease called Addison’s disease, according to the Mayo Clinic. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism editorial notes that they also face higher risks regarding COVID-19. Addison’s affects only about 1 in 100,000 people. With this disease, the adrenal glands, located above each kidney, are damaged and don't produce enough corticosteroid hormones.RELATED: What You Need to Know About COVID-19 if You Have AsthmaPeople Taking Oral Corticosteroids Should Continue to Do SoA corticosteroid works by mimicking cortisol to help the body combat inflammation and stress. The drugs, however, have a dual nature. They can reduce the inflammation that causes things like pain in people with RA and exacerbations in people with severe asthma, but they also lower the immune defenses when taken regularly. This immunosuppression may explain why some people taking oral steroid medications regularly may struggle when they get the virus.“Chronic steroid therapy can affect the body’s immune system [response] to certain infections, particularly fungus infections and tuberculosis; and it may actually alter the immune system in regard to fighting off certain viruses and bacteria as well,” says Albert Rizzo, MD, chief medical officer with the American Lung Association. Dr. Mirmira and his coauthors note that people should continue taking their medications as prescribed to keep underlying conditions under control, but Dr. Rizzo emphasizes that the dose makes a difference. “The higher the dose of oral steroids and the longer one takes them, the risk is higher,” he says. “This means that each patient should discuss trying to get on the lowest dose of oral steroids needed to control the underlying chronic condition to decrease the risks.”Patients should not lower or taper their doses on their own but should consult with their doctor, according to Rizzo.Upping the Dose May Help if Symptoms StartIf people taking these medications start to experience COVID-19 symptoms, they may actually need to increase their daily oral corticosteroid dose.“Those who are taking steroids for long periods of time we assume do not have normal adrenal function,” says Mirmira. “To compensate for a lack of adrenal function, their dose may have to be increased to respond to the inflammation caused by COVID.”The editorial authors recommend if people with known primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency develop symptoms such as a fever and a dry and continuous cough, they should double their oral corticosteroid dose immediately and continue doing so until the fever has subsided. The authors call this a “sick day” rule that many patients should have already been instructed to be following by their doctor. But each patient’s situation is unique, so only make medication dose changes in response to becoming sick after discussion with your specialist physician (such as an endocrinologist or rheumatologist) or primary care doctor.Do speak to your medical team if you are on long-term oral corticosteroid therapy to determine a plan for adjusting your dose for this type of situation so that you are prepared if you do get sick.“Every patient who is on long-term replacement corticosteroid therapy follows ‘sick day’ rules that instruct them to double their dose first if they are sick and then call the doctor,” says Mirmira. “Increasing the dose of your steroids when you don’t have normal adrenal gland function could save your life, and waiting to talk to a doctor sometimes can be delayed, and that could make matters worse.”He adds that in this case there is no downside to doubling the medication in the short term.And again, the bottom line is that all patients whose doctors have prescribed these daily oral corticosteroid drugs should continue taking them. “Some people might think these medications increase [their] risk of getting infected or increase the severity so [they] should stop taking them,” says Dr. Kaiser, “but they can get very sick from stopping them, so they should not stop.”A Lesser Risk Posed by Inhaled and Topical CorticosteroidsCorticosteroids are also prescribed in inhaled forms and topical solutions that are applied to the skin. These medications, while in the same class as oral corticosteroids, pose fewer complications, according to Mirmira, because they are usually in lower doses and they have less systemic effect in the body. “Drugs taken by mouth have a greater effect in your entire body and are usually in a higher concentration than inhaled or topical corticosteroids,” Mirmira says.Many people with asthma, for example, take inhaled corticosteroids because their condition is not severe enough to warrant taking oral medicines.RELATED: A Guide to Asthma TreatmentThese medications include fluticasone propionate (Advair), mometasone (Asmanex), ciclesonide (Alvesco), fluticasone (Flovent), budesonide (Pulmicort), budesonide and formoterol (Symbicort), and beclomethasone (Qvar).Michael Blaiss, MD, the executive medical director of the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, estimates that between about 1 in 4 and 1 in 5 patients with asthma use regular inhaled medication. Dr. Blaiss adds that while these medications may suppress the immune system to a degree, that effect is relatively mild.“There is really minimal systemic absorption, and we really don’t have any significant data that the typical doses of inhaled corticosteroids have any major effect on the immune system,” he says. “When we inhale the corticosteroids, the effect is in the lungs primarily; it doesn’t go throughout the body having an effect.”Although comprehensive research is yet to be done, Blaiss mentions that there is speculation that inhaled steroids could provide some protection from COVID-19. “The reason is that some of the inhaled corticosteroids may decrease the receptor sites found on the cells in the lungs where the virus binds,” he says.Why Might Dexamethasone Help in Severe Cases?If steroid medications might increase the risk of COVID-19, why then can they help some patients who are very sick with COVID-19?While it may sound contradictory, Blaiss says that the drugs do have the potential to be either harmful or helpful when it comes to COVID-19. “Depending on the situation, they can suppress the immune system and make you more vulnerable to the virus or be a treatment,” he says.According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a combination therapy of corticosteroids and an antiviral agent may reduce symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (a life-threatening respiratory illness) related to COVID-19. And the NIH strongly recommends the corticosteroid dexamethasone as part of a treatment plan in hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen, with the greatest effect observed in patients who require mechanical ventilation.The NIH based its advice on a study published in July 2020 in The New England Journal of Medicine that found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients on oxygen support (either mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone) who received 6 milligrams of dexamethasone daily for up to 10 days had reduced mortality within 28 days compared with similar patients not taking the steroid.Blaiss explains that many people with severe COVID-19 experience a cytokine storm, an overreaction of the immune system, which releases an overabundance of cytokines (chemicals that, in excess, can cause hyperinflammation and damage the lungs and other organs), according to a report published in October 2020 in the journal Clinica Chimica Acta; International Journal of Clinical Chemistry.“Dexamethasone stays in the system longer than most steroids and blunts the immune system,” he says.Remember: Steroid drugs function by dialing down the immune response and reducing inflammation. It’s not necessarily ideal to have the immune response dialed down if you’re counting on it to protect you from the virus that causes COVID-19 or other infections. But if you’re already sick and COVID-19 has ramped up your immune response in an unhealthy way, a steroid drug that can help lessen that response could potentially be helpful, Blaiss explains.NEWSLETTERSSign up for our Daily Health News Newsletter!Enter your emailSubscribeBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

(Greg Baker/AFP via Getty Images)By Zhang Dun8/4/2020Updated: 8/4/2020PrintA Chinese law professor at Tsinghua University, known for being an outspoken critic of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), was arrested and detained for six days in July on allegations of “soliciting prostitutes.”After he was released, he issued an open letter, declaring, “Totalitarianism will lose, freedom will come to my country!” He called on people to abandon the regime and have hope for the future.But the university soon fired him.Police arrested 57-year-old Xu Zhangrun at his home in Beijing on July 6. Police later said he was detained on suspicion of soliciting prostitution.Xu was released on July 12. Three days later, Tsinghua University dismissed Xu for having committed “a serious violation of the 10 Standards of Professional Conduct for Teachers in Tertiary Institutes in the New Era.” The guidelines, issued by China’s Ministry of Education in 2018, stipulate that teachers are to be fired or punished if they say or do anything that undermines the authority of the CCP or violates the directions and policies of the Party. According to the guidelines, teachers should “adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a new era and support the leadership of the CCP,” referring to Chinese leader Xi’s political ideology.After his firing, over 500 Tsinghua University alumni initiated a donation drive for Xu that brought in more than 100,000 yuan ($14,308). In his July 19 open letter, Xu thanked them but said he would not accept the money. He said he was still able to make a living by writing, and that the money should go to people who experience great hardships.The charge of “soliciting prostitutes” has often been used by authorities to crack down on dissidents. Xu’s friends said it was likely his open criticism of the Chinese regime that led to his arrest.In February, Xu called out the CCP for causing the global pandemic, in an article titled, “The Angry People Fear No More.” In the article, he criticized the Chinese regime for having wrought disasters due to its “incompetence,” “moral corruption,” and “institutional failures.” He called on the 1.4 billion Chinese people to “get ready to embrace with your strength, your heart, and your life—the spirit of freedom that shall shine upon the land.”In May, Xu published another article titled, “China, the Lone Boat in the Ocean of World Civilization,” providing a laundry list of the Chinese regime’s deceptive tactics. He concluded by saying, “Enough with the mountain of corpses and the seas of blood from 70 years of red dictatorship!”Li Hengqing, also a Tsinghua University alumni and former student dissident during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, told The Epoch Times that the communist regime uses the prostitution allegation to criminalize anyone it pleases. “The regime shows no bottom line when it comes to [making up] excuses. I have no doubt that’s what they would do,” Li said.

I chose a pretty black and white buffalo check as well as a fun damask print to use in my picture frames. I simply cut the paper to fit inside the frames. I had a painting that I wanted to use in my design, one that I painted a while back that I just love.. so I started with my moon face cow painting in the center and then I proceeded to figure out how to arrange the frames around it and hung them all up. I am so pleased with how it turned out.I used 2 8x10, 2 5x7, and I had 2 small mirrors that I also used. I think it is important to have some sort of balance with a gallery wall but even more important to use what you like. I am so glad I decided to repurpose the empty frames and give it a try.They are easy to change if I want to and I think it adds a fun touch to this corner of my craft room.I had everything on hand so this project didn't cost me anything.. but could certainly be an inexpensive project even if I had to go purchase the items.

In a recent study published in Molecular Psychiatry, we first demonstrate that Ih (the membrane current mediated by HCN channels) and HCN1 protein expression were increased in dorsal, but not in ventral, CA1 region following chronic, but not acute stress. This upregulation of Ih was restricted to the perisomatic region of CA1 neurons and contributed to a reduction of neuronal excitability. A reduction of HCN1 protein expression in dorsal CA1 region before the onset of chronic unpredictable stress-induced depression was sufficient to provide resilient effects to chronic unpredictable stress. Furthermore, in vivo block of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pumps, a manipulation known to increase intracellular calcium levels and upregulate Ih, produced anxiogenic-like behavior and an increase in Ih, similar to that observed in chronic unpredictable stress model of depression. Here, we share our view on (1) how the function and expression of HCN1 channels are changed in the brain in a subcellular region-specific manner during the development of depression and (2) how a reduction of HCN1 protein expression provides resilience to chronic stress.Commentary on: Kim CS, Brager DH, Johnston D. Perisomatic changes in h-channels regulate depressive behaviors following chronic unpredictable stress. Mol Psychiatry. 2018; 23: 892–903. DOI: 10.1038/mp.2017.28.The limbic–cortical system is an integral brain region underlying the action of depression and antidepressants.1,2 Major depression is a mental disorder characterized by an all-encompassing low mood, low self-esteem, and loss of interest or pleasure in enjoyable activities. Current existing antidepressants work mainly on targeting the monoamine system and increasing serotonin levels in the limbic brain areas including hippocampus. The hippocampus is involved in the symptoms of depression such as behavior despair and anhedonia as well as a site of action for antidepressant responses. About 30% of depressed patients do not respond to available antidepressant drugs (i.e., treatment-resistant depression (TRD)).3 This TRD requires trial-and-error combinations of multiple different medication regimens and electrical stimulation therapies.4 Although electrical stimulation therapies (e.g., electro convulsive therapy, deep brain stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation) are often effective to treat TRD through a change in brain activity, they also cause unwanted severe side effects such as memory loss and can be cost prohibitive for patients. Recent groundbreaking clinical findings for TRD demonstrate that a single intravenous injection with a subanesthetic dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) provides a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect.5 Given that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, as an anesthetic agent, treatment of depression by ketamine is not covered by insurance. Furthermore, ketamine has the potential for side effects such as psychotomimetic effects and drug misuse.Growing evidence suggests a possible link between hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated nonselective cation (HCN) channels and depression. Whole-brain knockout mice in which either the pore-forming (HCN1 and HCN2) protein or an auxiliary channel subunit, tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b interacting protein (TRIP8b) of HCN channels were deleted, all result in a reduction of functional Ih (the membrane current mediated by HCN channels) showed antidepressant-like behaviors.6 The HCN channels are members of the voltage-gated cation channel superfamily. The HCN1 is a main isoform of HCN channels (HCN1–HCN4) and is highly expressed in the hippocampal CA1 region, showing a gradient of increasing channel expression along the somatodendritic axis.7 HCN channels are active at the resting membrane potential leading to the generation of a noninactivating inward current that contributes to the intrinsic membrane properties, neuronal excitability, synaptic integration, and synaptic plasticity.8 Because there is no specific HCN channel blockers or genetic animal models that provide region-specific manipulation of HCN1 channels, we developed a lentiviral shRNA system, which provides sequence-specific manipulation with spatial and temporal control and high transduction efficiency.9 When HCN1 protein was reduced (about 40%–50%) in dorsal CA1 region (which corresponds to the posterior hippocampus in human) in normal rats, we observed antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects in specific behavioral tests (e.g., open-field test, elevated plus maze test, and forced swim test). Given the limited lentiviral shRNA infection in dorsal CA1 region (about 30% of the dorsal CA1 region), it was quite surprising that a reduction of functional Ih made such significant changes in behaviors. Furthermore, the ventral hippocampus (which corresponds to anterior hippocampus in humans) is known to be heavily involved in emotion-related behaviors such as fear and anxiety, so we assumed that we might see similar behavioral effects following a reduction of HCN1 protein expression in ventral CA1 region. However, in spite of a reduction of Ih in ventral CA1 neurons from the viral shRNA infection, there were no effects on anxiolytic- or antidepressant-like behaviors. These results suggest that a reduction of functional Ih in dorsal versus ventral CA1 region produced differential behavioral outputs.The rodent hippocampus can be separated into dorsal and ventral regions based on the functional differentiation.10 In particular, intrinsic membrane properties of CA1 neurons between dorsal and ventral hippocampus are quite different.11 For example, dorsal CA1 neurons have more hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and a lower input resistance at rest compared with ventral CA1 neurons. In addition, higher resting G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels conductance activated by A1 adenosine receptors are present in dorsal compared with ventral CA1 neurons. Because we observed antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects following a reduction of HCN1 protein in dorsal but not ventral CA1 region in normal rats, the important questions are (1) whether function and expression of HCN1 channels are altered during the development of depression, (2) whether changes in functional Ih and HCN1 protein expression occur in dorsal or ventral or both region of hippocampus, and (3) whether a reduction of HCN1 protein expression can prevent the development of depression (i.e., resilient effects to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)). In a recent study published in Molecular Psychiatry,12 we addressed these issues.Chronic stress can be a risk factor for the development of depression. Depressed patients show relatively high cortisol levels due to CUS-induced impairment of hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis.13 In this regard, CUS protocol has been widely used as an experimental tool to examine the development of psychopathology, including depression.14 When rats are exposed to random, intermittent, and unpredictable stress daily for two to four weeks, rats show a decreased sucrose preference (i.e., anhedonia), increased anxiety, and increased passive activity in an extremely stressful environment (i.e., behavioral despair) (Figure 1(b)), which are all core symptoms of human depression. Using the CUS model of depression, we found that functional Ih and HCN1 protein expression are increased in dorsal but not ventral CA1 neurons. This is consistent with the results shown by the differential behavioral effects observed through a reduction of HCN1 protein in dorsal versus ventral CA1 region in normal rats. In addition, biochemical assays revealed that HCN2 protein expression is also increased in dorsal but not in ventral CA1 region. Therefore, upregulation of functional Ih stems from increases in both HCN1 and HCN2 protein expression in dorsal but not in ventral CA1 region, and also there is a correlation in the time courses for upregulation of Ih and depression-like symptoms during the development of depression. In addition, when depressed rats were not exposed to further CUS for four weeks (i.e., recovery period), an increase in passive activity (in forced swim test) and upregulation of Ih were back to normal levels (Figure 1(b)).Figure 1. Perisomatic upregulation of functional Ih regulate depressive behaviors following CUS. (A) Representative illustration of development of depression following CUS and recovery. (B) Depressive-like symptoms gradually increased with increasing duration of CUS. These depressive-like symptoms decreased following four-week recovery period. (C) Neuronal excitability is gradually decreased with increasing duration of CUS. This CUS-induced a decrease in neuronal excitability do not occur after a four-week recovery period. (D) Perisomatic increases in Ih-sensitive electrophysiological measurement (i.e., resonance frequency, fR) and HCN1 protein expression along the somatodendritic region of dorsal CA1. AP: action potential; CUS: chronic unpredictable stress; HCN: hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated nonselective cation; SLM: stratum lacunosum moleculare; SR: stratum radiatum; SO: stratum oriens; SP: stratum pyramidale.One of the key features of HCN1 (and HCN2) channels in the hippocampus is a distant-dependent increase in channel expression along the somatodendritic axis.7 Given the contributions of HCN1 channels to neuronal excitability and synaptic integration, a change in subcellular expression of HCN1 channels along the somatodendritic axis of CA1 neurons has been implicated in the neuropathology of psychiatric disorders such as epilepsy. Interestingly, we found that upregulation of functional Ih is limited to the perisomatic but not dendritic region of dorsal CA1 neurons in CUS model of depression (Figure 1(d)). This abnormal perisomatic upregulation of Ih might be due to (1) the increases in cytoplasmic calcium levels, which in turn activate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and store-operated channels15 or (2) the involvement of specific TRIP8b isoforms (e.g., an increase in Ih by isoform A4 and a decrease in Ih by isoform B2).16 Major depression is the most frequent psychiatric comorbidity in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Because treatment for patients with comorbid epilepsy and major depression is difficult due to the fact that (1) conventional antidepressant drugs can lower seizure threshold and (2) antiepileptic drugs can cause mood instability. When HCN1 protein was reduced in dorsal CA1 region, we did not observe any abnormal epileptic-like activity in voltage-sensitive dye imaging and extracellular field potential recording.9 Interestingly, a reduction of dendritic Ih in CA1 region of hippocampus was observed in the kainic acid-induced poststatus epilepticus model of TLE.17 Therefore, changes in subcellular expression of functional Ih might be a cellular and molecular consequences of major depression and TLE.Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a disorder of neural circuitry in limbic–cortical areas. Functional brain imaging of major depressed patients shows increased or decreased regional metabolic activities in different regions of these areas, which can be reversed by clinical antidepressant treatment or chronic electrical stimulation.2,4 There is a strong positive correlation between brain energy metabolism and neuronal excitability.18 Neuronal excitability can be determined by measurements of input resistance and action potential firing of neurons at rest. Interestingly, bimodal, abnormal changes in regional metabolic activities in different regions of limbic–cortical areas, increased neuronal excitability of lateral amygdala neurons,19 or decreased neuronal excitability of dorsal CA1 neurons12 following chronic stress have all been reported (Figure 1(c)). In addition, functional Ih and HCN2 protein expression are reduced in ventral tegmental area following CUS.20 Given the neural circuitry disorder of MDD, a change in either HCN1 (in dorsal hippocampal CA1 region) or HCN2 (in ventral tegmental area (VTA)) protein expression might provide therapeutic effects. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can be a biological marker for depression.21 Along with the differential changes in functional Ih from depression and antidepression in dorsal CA1 region versus VTA, BDNF expression also shows opposing effects in those brain regions. A reduction of BDNF expression in hippocampus produces depressive-like effects,22 whereas antidepressant-like effects in VTA.23 In addition, Yang et al., reported that changes in action potential firing mode (i.e., tonic firing to burst firing) in the lateral habenula (LHb) occurred in the animal model of depression.24 Because LHb region is known as an antireward center, a hyperactive neuronal excitability of LHb neurons can effectively inhibit downstream reward-related brain regions such as VTA. In a similar way, a hypoactive neuronal excitability of dorsal CA1 neurons in the animal model of depression might offer difficulties to carry spatial-related information to downstream brain regions. Indeed, impaired spatial learning and memory was often observed in depressed patients.25 Furthermore, forebrain-specific HCN1 knockout mice showed enhanced short- and long-term spatial learning and memory.26Most of the depression researches to date have been focused on finding the mechanisms underlying the action of depression and antidepressants. Recently, there is a growing interest in the concept of the “susceptibility to depression” and “resilience to depression” in stressful environments.27 Why do some people become depressed (i.e., susceptibility to depression), while others are not (i.e., resiliency to depression) following stressful life events? Resilience is considered to be a positive coping process from adverse stress. In a recent report, a single or multiple injections of neuropeptide Y (NPY) into basolateral amygdala produced resilience to stress in rats through a reduction of functional Ih.28 Importantly, we also found that a reduction of Ih in dorsal CA1 region before the CUS-induced onset of depression is sufficient to provide resilient effects to CUS (Figure 2). Before onset of CUS-induced depression, a reduction of functional Ih in dorsal CA1 region/neurons led to (1) changes in intrinsic membrane properties, (2) an increase in neuronal excitability, (3) an enhancement of the BDNF-mTOR signaling pathways, (4) an increase in field excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and (5) an increase in dorsal hippocampal activity9 (Figure 2). These cellular changes might prime the brain to prevent the development of depression (i.e., resilience to depression).Figure 2. A reduction of functional Ih in dorsal CA1 region/neurons confers resiliency to CUS. (a) Representative illustration of development of resilience to CUS. (b and c) Changes in functional Ih and neuronal excitability of lentiviral-shRNA-infected dorsal CA1 neurons (i.e., shRNA-control and shRNA-HCN1) before and after development of depression. (D and E) A reduction of HCN1 protein expression leads to increases in fEPSPs, hippocampal activity, mature BDNF, and pmTOR protein expression. AP: action potential; BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CUS: chronic unpredictable stress; fEPSP: field excitatory postsynaptic potential; HCN: hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated nonselective cation; pmTOR phosphorylation of mTOR.It is quite amazing that a reduction of a single ion channels (i.e., HCN1) in a certain brain region (i.e., dorsal CA1 region) can change physiological, biochemical, and behavioral outputs. However, targeting HCN1 channels might not be a viable clinical approach for major depression due to (1) the lack of a subunit-specific inhibitor of HCN channels, (2) the fact that the HCN1 channel is also expressed in the heart and thus inhibitors could have effects on cardiac function, and (3) the changes in opposing directions in different brain regions (e.g., dorsal CA1 region vs. VTA). In this regard, targeting a brain region-specific manipulation of HCN1 channels using a viral delivery system (i.e., adeno-associated virus system) might be a possible clinical approach. Alternatively, the auxiliary subunit of HCN channels, TRIP8b, could also be an important and viable target for treatment of major depression.Author ContributionsC.S.K. and D.J. developed the structure and arguments for the paper and wrote the paper.

DSRCT presenting as a primary head and neck tumor has rarely been described in the literature. We present three cases of DSRCT arising in the head and neck to further characterize its clinicopathological features. All three patients were male and aged 36, 30 and 17 years. The involved sites included the orbit (1 case) and submandibular gland (2 cases). The tumors ranged in size from 2.4 to 3.5 cm (mean, 2.1 cm). Histologically, all tumors showed irregular-shaped, variable-sized nests of small round cells deposited in an abundant desmoplastic stroma. Tumor cells contained scant amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and small hyperchromatic nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli. Immunohistochemically, the tumors were positive for keratin (AE1/AE3) (3/3), desmin (3/3), vimentin (2/2), NSE (1/1) and EMA (1/1). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis demonstrated the presence of EWSR1 and WT1 rearrangements in all three cases. All patients received surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. There was no evidence of recurrence and metastasis in two patients, and the third suffered lung metastasis. DSRCT arising in the head and neck represents an extremely rare condition. It is easily mistaken as poorly differentiated carcinoma due to similar morphology and expression of epithelial markers. Immunohistochemistry assay in conjunction with molecular detection of EWSR1::WT1 fusion will be helpful for arriving at an accurate diagnosis to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.IntroductionDesmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is an extremely rare malignant tumor that commonly manifests as an intra-abdominal or pelvic mass with a predilection for young males. It typically shows co-expresssion of epithelial, mesenchymal and neural markers and harbors a characteristic t (11; 22) (p13; q12) translocation resulting a specific EWSR1::WT1 fusion gene transcript.1,2 Extra-abdominal involvements, such as central nervous system, mediastinum, pleura, lung, paratesticular region, bone and soft tissue, are very uncommon, comprising less than 5% of DSRCT.1–6 Manifestations in the head and neck are even more rare. To date, only 22 patients diagnosed with DSRCT have been reported in the English literature.5–25 Due to its rarity and unexpected occurrence in the head and neck, DSRCT is likely to be misdiagnosed as other malignancies by clinicians and pathologists. Herein, we present three additional cases of DSRCT arising in the head and neck to enhance the recognition of its clinicopathological features and avoid diagnostic and therapeutic pitfalls.Case PresentationClinical FindingsCase 1A 36-year-old male presented with decreased visual acuity in his right eye with difficulty in eye opening for more than one month. B-ultrasound showed a well-defined solid mass with uneven internal echoes on the posterior pole of right orbit, measuring approximately 22.2 × 20.7 mm. A Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an ovoid, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass with slight enhancement in the right orbital roof, measuring approximately 2.4 × 2.1 × 1.6 cm in size (Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed a solid heterogeneous mass in the right orbital roof (Figure 1B). Then, the patient was treated with a local excision of the tumor. The referring diagnosis was poorly differentiated carcinoma. To confirm the diagnosis, the pathological materials were sent to our department for further consideration. After re-evaluation of the H&E slides with application of immunohistochemistry and FISH analysis, the diagnosis of DSRCT was finally rendered. The patient received postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There was no evidence of local recurrence or metastasis 14 months after surgery.Figure 1. Imaging features of DSRCT (case 1). A CT scan showed an ovoid, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass of the right orbital roof, with slightly enhancement (A). MRI revealed a solid heterogeneous mass in the right orbital roof (B).Case 2A 30-year-old man went to the clinic of a local hospital because of the left submandibular gland mass for several months. After admission, the patient underwent a complete excision of the mass. Intraoperatively, two masses were identified, measuring approximately 3.5 × 3.8 × 2.5 cm and 1 × 0.8 × 0.6 cm, respectively. The lesion was considered as poorly differentiated carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation by the referring pathologist. The patient was treated with an adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Unfortunately, CT scan revealed multiple metastatic nodules in bilateral lungs 5 months later. Then, the patient came to our department for further diagnosis. With the adjunctive study of immunohistochemistry and FISH, the lesion was re-diagnosed as DSRCT.Case 3A 17-year-old man complained of a slowly enlarging and painless mass of the left submaxilla for more than one year. Physical examination revealed a well-defined solid mass in the left submandibular gland, measuring approximately 2.5 × 2 cm. MRI showed a solid homogeneous mass of the left submandibular gland, suspicious of lymphoma or mixed tumor. Subsequently, the patient underwent a complete excision of the tumor. The referring pathologist suggested a diagnosis of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Tissue sections were sent to our department and finally diagnosed as DSRCT. Then, the patient received an adjuvant chemotherapy. There was no evidence of local recurrence or metastasis 8 months after surgery.Pathological FeaturesGrossly, all specimens presented multinodular masses ranging from 2.4 to 3.5 cm in maximum diameter (mean, 2.1 cm). On the cut surface, all three tumors were solid and firm in consistency and grayish-white in color. Histologically, all three lesions showed similar morphological features, which consisted of uniform and small round, oval cells embedded in an abundant desmoplastic stroma (Figure 2A). Tumor cells were arranged in small clumps, large nests, trabecular or cord-like pattern (Figure 2B, 2C), possessing hyperchromatic nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm with indistinct borders (Figure 2D). The mitotic figures were easily identified. The desmoplastic stroma was composed of spindle cells mimicking fibroblasts/myofibroblasts with hyaline degeneration and vascular proliferation in some areas. Case 2 extensively infiltrated the peripheral nerves. The tumor showed lymph node metastasis in case 3.Figure 2. Histological features of DSRCT. Small round cells embedded in abundant desmoplastic stroma (A). The tumor cells were arranged in small clumps, large nests (B), trabecular or cord-like pattern (C) embedded in abundant desmoplastic stroma. Note hyperchromatic nuclei with scant pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and indistinct margins (D).Immunohistochemical and Molecular FindingsImmunohistochemically, the tumors showed positivity for keratin (AE1/AE3) (3/3) (Figure 3A), desmin (3/3), vimentin (2/2), CD99 (2/2), synaptophysin (1/3), NSE (1/1), EMA (1/1) (Figure 3B) and SMARCB1 (INI-1) (1/1). Besides, desmin and vimentin displayed a paranuclear cytoplasmic dot-like positivity pattern (Figure 3C, 3D). Other markers, including WT1, ERG, FLI1, MyoD1, myogenin, chromogranin A, CD56 and TTF1, were all negative. The Ki-67 index was 40%∼50%.Figure 3. Immunohistochemical features of DSRCT. The tumor cells showed diffuse and strong positivity for AE1/AE3 (A) and EMA (B). Desmin (C) and vimentin (D) showed a paranuclear cytoplasmic dot-like immunostaining.FISH assay was carried out in all three cases using the EWSR1 (22q12) Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe and WT1 (22q12) Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe. All three cases had the EWSR1 (Figure 4A) and WT1 (Figure 4B) rearrangements.Figure 4. Molecular features of DSRCT. FISH assay displayed the presence of EWSR1 (A) and WT1 rearrangements (B).DiscussionDesmoplastic small round cell tumor is a unique mesenchymal neoplasm with distinct histological features and multiphenotypic differentiation, which was first described by Gerald and Rosai in 1989.26 It is a highly aggressive tumor with a predilection for adolescent males and occurs predominantly in the abdominal and pelvic cavity. Isolated cases of extra-abdominal involvement have been reported in the central nervous system, mediastinum, pleura, lung, paratesticular region, bone and soft tissue.1–5 The presentation of DSRCT as a primary head and neck lesion is even extremely rare. To our knowledge, only 22 cases have been documented in previous literatures.5–25 In this study, we present a small series of three additional cases of DSRCT in the head and neck to increase the reported number to 25. The clinicopathological features of 25 cases are summarized in Table 1. Like classic intra-abdominal DSRCT, DSRCT of the head and neck also occurred in the second to third decade of lifetime, with a mean and median age of 26 and 25 years (range, 4 to 61 years), respectively. Compared with intra-abdominal DSRCT (male : female, 5:1),7,11 there was a more prominent male predilection with a male to female ratio of 24: 1. Tumors arose in the salivary glands (8 cases), brain (4 cases), orbital region (4 cases), sinonasal region (4 cases), cranium (3 cases), middle ear (1 case) and neck (1 case). Tumor size (available in 17 cases) ranged from 1.5 to 8 cm in maximum diameter (mean, 4.1 cm). Clinically, most tumors presented as slowly enlarging masses or swelling of soft tissue, occasionally with pain. The specific symptoms and signs of DSRCT depend on the tumor location and involved organs or tissues.5,11,13,14,17,18,22Table 1.

In some cases, tumor cells may be arranged in large nests with central necrosis, tubular-like structures, and trabecular or cord-like patterns. Other unusual features, including Homer Wright-like rosettes, papillary structures, zones resembling transitional cell carcinoma and myxoid stroma, can also be identified occasionally.2,7,27 In addition, tumor cells may also show rhabdoid, spindled, pleomorphic, vacuolated, signet-ring or larger cell morphology.25,27 Rare cases simply consist of solid sheets of round cells without desmoplastic stroma, making identification of this rare tumor even more difficult.DSRCT has a distinctive immunohistochemical feature. The tumor demonstrates multiphenotypic differentiation with co-expression of epithelial (keratin, EMA), mesenchymal (desmin, vimentin) and neural markers (NSE). Of note, typical examples of DSRCT usually display a unique paranuclear cytoplasmic dot-like staining of desmin and vimentin. The reported cases of DSRCT in the head and neck showed variable expression of AE1/AE3 (95.7%, 22/23), EMA (70.6%, 12/17), desmin (91.7%, 22/24), vimentin (100%, 17/17) and NSE (76.2%, 16/21), which are almost in line with intraabdominal tumors.27–29 More than 95% of DSRCT harbors a unique cytogenetic abnormality, t (11; 22) (p13; q12), which fuses the amino terminus of EWSR1 gene on 22q12 to the carboxy terminus of WT1 on 11p13.30,31 All tested cases (20/20, 100%) of DSRCT in the head and neck possessed EWSR1::WT1 gene translocation. Besides, immunohistochemistry for WT1 amino terminus and carboxy terminus antibodies may be useful to identify EWSR1::WT1 transcript despite the presence of some controversies regarding the epitope specificity of WT1 antibody.32 Most of previous studies revealed that DSRCT showed nuclear expression of WT1 antibody (Clone:C-19) to the carboxy terminus with positive rates of 70%∼100%, but no expression of WT1 antibody (Clone:6F-H2) to the amino terminus.21,28,32 In this series, three cases were all negative for WT1 amino terminus antibody. However, the other two studies reported that DSRCT displayed discrete nuclear or paranuclear cytoplasmic staining of WT1 antibody to the amino terminus, with positive rates of 91% (29/32) and 81.4% (22/27), respectively.7,27 Murphy et al found that some cases had novel fusion transcripts or expressed full-length WT1, resulting in nuclear staining for WT1 N-terminal antibody; they proposed that fusion transcripts in DSRCT resulted in the altered immunostaining pattern for WT1.32 Hence, interpretation of WT1 immunostaining requires knowledge of antibody target epitopes and correlation with results of molecular testing for the EWSR1::WT1 fusion transcript. Among DSRCT in the head and neck, 50% (6/12) of cases were immunoreactive for WT1. However, the antibody type and immunostaining pattern were uncertain in most cases, because these cases were mainly from isolated case reports or small series.The histogenesis of DSRCT is still uncertain owing to few studies focused on it in the literature. Originally, DSRCT was speculated to derive from mesothelial or submesothelial cells, given that it mainly occurs in the mesothelial-lined cavities and expresses both epithelial and mesenchymal markers.7 However, some tumors arising in locations not lined by mesothelial cells challenged this hypothesis. Furthermore, there are no ultrastructural features of mesothelial differentiation in DSRCT,29,33 which also does not support the above viewpoint. Therefore, the issue of origin of DSRCT remains to be studied.The main differential diagnosis of DSRCT embraces a variety of malignancies with small round cell morphology, especially poorly differentiated carcinoma (including neuroendocrine carcinoma), Ewing sarcoma (ES) and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS). Due to the uncommon tumor site as well as similar histologic features and expression of epithelial markers, all three cases in this series were initially misdiagnosed as poorly differentiated carcinoma by the referring pathologists. But different from DSRCT, poorly differentiated carcinoma usually lacks prominent desmoplastic stroma and expression of desmin. Moreover, it is also absent of EWSR1::WT1 fusion. In addition, ES, especially adamantinoma-like Ewing sarcoma (ALES), also needs to be differentiated from DSRCT, because both tumors have overlapping immunophenotype and cytogenetic features. ALES is prone to occur in the head and neck and also express AE1/AE3.34 However, ALES is generally positive for CD99 (membrane staining), NKX2.2 and p40,35 but usually negative for desmin.36 More importantly, ES, including ALES, possess EWSR1::FLI1 fusion instead of EWSR1::WT1 fusion in DSRCT.31 Finally, ARMS can be confused with DSRCT. The application of myogenic markers of myogenin and MyoD1 is helpful in the distinction between ARMS and DSRCT; again, the detection of FOXO1 translocation by FISH can also distinguish the two entities. Other small round cell tumors occurring in the head and neck may also enter into the differential diagnosis of DSRCT, such as malignant melanoma and neuroblastoma. The positive staining of melanotyic markers in melanoma, including S100 protein, SOX10, HMB-45 and Melan-A, helps to distinguish it from DSRCT. Although neuroblastoma and DSRCT are both positive for NSE, neuroblastoma is usually negative for AE1/AE3 and desmin. It is worth noting that abdominal DSRCT can develop metastasis to the head and neck region occasionally.37 In such settings, detailed medical history data and careful clinical examinations are warranted in the distinction. All three patients reported in this study had no special clinical history.So far, the treatment of DSRCT remains challenging. Despite a comprehensive therapeutic strategy of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy applied, the overall prognosis remains very poor, with approximately 29% for a 3-year survival and just 18% for a 5-year survival,8 respectively. Recently, some reports revealed that patients treated with aggressive surgery and intense alkylator therapy (P6 protocol: vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and etoposide) had a better prognosis.6 Besides, patients with superficial DSRCT also have a better outcome, because earlier clinical manifestations and symptoms offer a greater opportunity of complete surgical excision.14 Among DSRCT of the head and neck, 6 of 22 (27.3%) patients with follow-up information died, with five cases dead of the disease and one dead of other causes. Two patients were alive with disease, and the other 14 remained well with no evidence of disease. Due to the limited follow-up duration, the prognosis of DSRCT in the head and neck is difficult to compare with that of intra-abdominal DSRCT. Therefore, whether there is a difference in the prognosis between the two subsets still need to be elucidated in the future.In summary, we describe three cases of extra-abdominal DSRCT arising primarily in the head and neck. Due to the unexpected occurrence of DSRCT in this unusual site and similar histological and/or immunohistochemical features, it may be easily misinterpreted as other small round cell tumors, especially poorly differentiated carcinoma (including neuroendocrine carcinoma). This study further demonstrates the importance of including DSRCT into the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors of the head and neck, particularly those affecting the young patients and expressing of epithelial markers. In challenging cases, molecular assays of EWSR1::WT1 fusion by RT-PCR, FISH or next-generation sequencing will be helpful for establishing a correct diagnosis.AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank Xue-Ke Zhou and Xu Cai for technical assistance and Qian-Ming Bai for great support in FISH testing.Ethical ApprovalNot applicable, because this article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.Informed ConsentNot applicable, because this article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.Author’s contributionSM drafted the manuscript; SMY and JXB collected clinical and follow-up data of three cases; BQM interpreted FISH results; WQF, ZL and LIW participated in histological diagnosis and immunohistochemical evaluation; WJ and YL participated in histological diagnosis and proofread the paper.

Dhows along Dubai Creek. (Susan James)By Susan James9/26/2014Updated: 9/26/2014PrintWho you meet can be as exciting as what you see during the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature in Dubai. Last March marked the Emirates’ sixth annual celebration of the written word with writers from all over the world flying in to participate in a week of scheduled events. Popular fiction writers, murder mystery authors, celebrity chefs, biographers, journalists, calligraphers, and poets showed up for a packed program of panels, workshops and Q&As to entertain, enlighten, and amuse enthusiastic audiences. Want advice on trendy topics for that bestseller you’ve been contemplating? Need to know how to get it published after it’s finished? The wordsmiths at the Festival of Literature will tell you in a dozen easy steps. As a special bonus, you can explore the wonderful world of ski slopes, sand dunes, and Arabian souks just outside the window. The Host CityThe home of the festival, Dubai, is an amazing place, an Emerald City that soars in jagged high-rise spires out of a desert that just a generation ago housed a few coral block buildings and some roaming camels. Fishing dhows with lateen rigs still sail up and down Dubai Creek as they have for millennia, but instead of Indian traders and Persian merchants clustering their wharves, skyscrapers, hallmarked by the world’s tallest building, form walls of glass and steel behind them. At the edge of this surreal scene, a celebration of books seems somehow right. Dubai’s Festival of Literature is the brainchild of British-born Isobel Abdulhoul, who came here as a bride in 1968. During the festival, I met with Abdulhoul at a lunch prepared by chef and cookbook author Greg Malouf. Over grilled quail, homemade laban cheese, and fresh sesame bread, she told me that when she came to Dubai the only books she had were those she'd brought with her. “I read them over and over and over and when I couldn’t find anymore, I opened Dubai’s first book store,” she said. It was Abdulhoul’s love of books that led her to launch the festival. This year over 8,000 visitors arrived in Dubai City to hear 170 authors discuss their work, autograph their latest creations, and talk about the world of literature. InterContinental Festival City, the hotel complex where the festival was held, was jammed with a milling sea of literature enthusiasts who roamed the centre and spilled out around outdoor food stands, shawarma stalls, and performance areas where stand-up comedians traded off with drum-thumping rock bands. In the halls and corridors there were tables of books everywhere you looked. It was my first year at the festival and the family-friendly event offered some of my favourite children’s authors and historical fiction writers signing their works and chatting about creativity. Would I see best-selling British author Rachel Hore? Would I be able to talk with her? The answer to both questions turned out to be yes.A Literary OasisTo celebrate the festival’s opening, an evening event called Desert Stanzas was planned out in the distant dunes. I travelled for an hour by minibus and then took a 4-wheel drive over shadowed sands to what at first appeared to be a brilliantly lit mirage, an oasis of tents and camels and oriental carpets rising spectacularly from a shallow bowl in the desert. We were greeted by rows of dancing men in long white traditional robes and lavishly dressed children who poured rosewater over our hands out of silver ewers. An Arabian buffet of exotic food, hot off of glowing coals, was set between the long lines of open tents where tables and cushions had been arranged. As we ate, we listened to poets from different cultures read their works; Andrew Motion, Britain’s former poet laureate, headlined the event. Celebrated Arab poet Khalid Albudoor gave a dramatic reading to the accompanying music of an Arabian oud, referring to his poetry as “melodies of travelling Bedouins.” That night, I learned that poetry is the language of the nomad recited in the evening around the campfire. “It doesn’t matter if you understand it,” German poet Frank Klötgen later told us, “try to feel it.” In that setting, it wasn’t difficult.For the Arabs of the Gulf, the beginning is the word and the word is everywhere you look. As in the Far East, calligraphy is a highly rated art, so the next day I made a pilgrimage to one of Dubai’s greatest calligraphers, Iranian-born Amir Hossein. His shop, The Golden Pen, is a tiny place in the Moroccan quarter of a western-style mall. Western classical music wafted me into an Aladdin’s cave crammed with treasures. Hossein is a restless artist always trying to push boundaries. He showed me a sewing needle, the smallest that he could find in the souk (open-air marketplace), and on the all but invisible head he had engraved the word “Allah.” The work was so tiny he had had to invent an entire toolkit to create it. In his shop vault he kept the opalescent nacre of a mollusk shell on which he had engraved the first 55 pages of the Koran. Its matching engraved bivalve had been a gift to the son of Dubai’s ruler. “The two pieces represent friendship,” said Hossein, holding the fragile shell to the light. It was so translucent that I could see his hand through it. As another gesture of friendship, he drew my name in Arabic calligraphy in handmade walnut ink with a sharpened stick of bamboo and made me a present of it.Murder Mystery DinnerFor something completely different the next day, I went to a panel of bestselling murder mystery writers. South African Deon Meyer shared the stage with British authors Simon Kernick and Peter James, and Swedish best-selling author Camilla Läckberg. How did they think up their stories? Did they always know who the killer would be? Sounds like Peter James gets much of his material riding around with the police of Brighton. “No one,” he told us, “knows more of life than a 30-year career cop.” James plots his works in detail (you could almost see the flow charts) while Läckberg likes to let things evolve. “You need an idea, a character, and an ending,” advised the woman whose first work of fiction written at the age of four was the murder of Mrs. Santa Claus.One thing the festival is particularly good at is arranging evening events (open to the public) to complement the day’s panels. Following the murder mystery panel, I went off to the Murder Mystery Dinner with a dimly-lit ballroom full of other mystery aficionados. The theme of the festival was Metamorphosis, and the Dubai Drama Group had prepared to perform a play entitled “A Modern Metamorphosis.” Over tuna tartare and beef tenderloin, we watched the actors create characters whose dialogue revealed hidden lives and secret yearnings. Who would die and who would be called out as the wily assassin? Each dinner table was asked to form a team, question the suspects, and then write down the identity of the suspected perpetrator. We called our table team “Medea,” a suitably sinister name for a group of hot shot amateur detectives who in the end managed to guess the identity of the villain. The Rhythms of TimeOn the last day of the festival, travel writer and panelist Tim Mackintosh-Smith quoted the words of a much earlier traveller, Ibn Battuta: “Time does not flow with the same speed in every place.” Outside, along Dubai Creek, an estuary flowing inward rather than outward to the sea, dhow builders were slowly fashioning the carapaces of boats whose antique design was buried in the past, while a mile away frantic crews of builders threw up skyscraper after skyscraper in a race to the future. At The Golden Pen, Amir Hossein painstakingly drew a flourish of complex calligraphy with ancient roots, while all around me authors cranked out books so quickly their publishers could scarcely keep up. As a fitting finale to my literary adventures, I took a taxi to look at the Persian Gulf. Scholars and poets had written about it. Merchants and travellers had sailed across it. I'd read about it, studied it in school, and there it was, blue and sparkling, beyond a wide swath of sand.The end of the beginning or the beginning of the end? In Dubai only time would tell.Susan James is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles. She has lived in India, the U.K., and Hawaii, and writes about travel, art, and culture.

(Patrick Lin/AFP/Getty Images)By Joan Delaney11/1/2011Updated: 10/1/2015PrintAs Shen Yun Performing Arts continues its world tour showcasing the lost traditions of ancient China, in a four-part series The Epoch Times takes a close look at these arts, their current state in China today, their undeniable influence in our world, and the significance of their miraculous revival. Culture is the soul of a nation, with its spiritual aspect being equally as important as physical factors such as race and land. If a country’s civilization is defined by the history of its cultural developments, then it naturally follows that the destruction of that culture leads to the end of the nation. Throughout China’s long history, despite many invasions and attacks, Chinese culture endured and thrived, and its essence was continuously passed down for 5,000 years. But the rise of communism in China had a devastating effect on the Middle Kingdom’s ancient culture and traditions. From the beginning, the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) plan to “revolutionize” Chinese culture was in fact an attempt to destroy its spirit completely. The traditional Chinese culture sought harmony between man and the universe and emphasized ethics and morality. It was based on the faiths of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism and embodied honesty, kindness, harmony, and tolerance. These principles and the social standards set by Confucius’s five cardinal virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faithfulness were anathema to the CCP’s policy of atheism. The CCP had an inherent ideological opposition to traditional Chinese culture—which believes in gods and a heavenly mandate—and made the culture an enemy in an effort to bolster its own control. Soon after the CCP came into power in 1949, it began to destroy churches and temples, burn scriptures, and force Buddhist monks and nuns to return to secular life. By the 1960s, there were hardly any religious places left in China. Mao Zedong’s Great Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966, brought even greater religious and cultural catastrophe with its campaign of “Casting Away the Four Olds”: old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. Buddhist and Taoist temples, historical and scenic sites, calligraphy, paintings, and antiques became the main targets for destruction by the Red Guards. Many one-of-a-kind books, calligraphy works, and paintings that had been collected by intellectuals were burned or shredded into pulp. Writer Qin Mu (1919–1992) described the Cultural Revolution in bleak terms: “It was truly an unprecedented calamity. [The CCP] imprisoned millions due to their association with a [targeted] family member, ended the lives of millions more, shattered families, turned children into hoodlums and villains, burned books, tore down ancient buildings, and destroyed ancient intellectuals’ gravesites, committing all kinds of crimes in the name of revolution.” In this way, the dignity and sacredness of religion and culture was annihilated, as was people’s spiritual identity formed by faith and culture. Many lost their moral bearings and became indoctrinated with the CCP’s own set of standards, such as class struggle, inciting hatred and violence, self-criticism, and “fighting with heaven and earth.” This “Party culture,” which has at its heart despotism and dictatorship, was established through continuous political movements and was promoted by the CCP as a continuation of traditional Chinese culture. After the Party adopted economic reform and an open-door policy, it renovated many churches as well as Buddhist and Taoist temples. Throughout China, temple fairs, art and calligraphy exhibits, culture festivals with dragon and lion dances, and New Year galas were staged. This, however, simply restored the superficial appearance of the culture. The essence of China’s profound culture had by then been well and truly gutted.

The girl, who remains unnamed, left home for school on April 26, according to the Associated Press. But she didn’t return home. Alexander Rzhanenkov of the St. Petersburg city hall told Russian news agencies on April 27, the girl went to Moscow’s Vnukovo airport where she mingled with a crowd boarding a flight to St. Petersburg. She then got on board with a large family with children. Police picked her up at St. Petersburg’s airport, where she was found alone. It was reported that the girl had never been on an airplane in her life—until Tuesday.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)By Colin Fredericson9/5/2017Updated: 9/5/2017PrintA woman thought she had stumbled upon riches. Instead, she was scammed out of $2,000 by some convincing con artists.The Wisconsin woman, who has not revealed her identity, thought she found a wallet with $150,000 in it. She was walking through a parking lot when a woman called out to her. The woman asked her if she dropped anything and showed her a fat wallet stuffed with cash, Fox News reported.“It was brown and it almost looked like the size of a brick,” said the victim to Fox 6 Now.A third woman arrived, and they said they were going to split the money three ways. The woman who first picked up the wallet said she worked at First Weber Realty and would get the money counted on a machine inside her office. She also said her boss could get paperwork drawn up to keep the money legally.The trio drove there and the woman went inside the office, later coming back with news that there was $150,000 in the wallet.At that point, the woman said that all three of them had to come up with some cash to show that they would be able to handle to be financially responsible. They drove to a local credit union. “I walked to the bank and withdrew the money,” said the victim.They all went back to First Weber Realty, seemingly to get the withdrawn money counted, but when it was the victim’s turn to go in, the two scammers fled with her money, and First Weber said they didn’t know the women.She spent three hours with them, thinking she would come out richer than before. Local police said they never heard of the scam. But such a scam is minor compared to those troubling the southern parts of the country.Bigger and more devious scams are plaguing disaster-stricken Texas. Those seeking to help the situation are advised to investigate the charities they are giving to, so that hundreds of thousands of dollars don’t go towards fake charities, which happened after Hurricane Sandy.According to NPR, people seeking to donate should be cautious about charities that are created specifically for one hurricane or other disaster. Reputable, well-known organizations are more trustworthy. The gofundme.com crowdfunding site is also taking steps to inform people of how they can identify reputable organizations that they would like to donate to through the online platform.They also recommend not giving cash directly, and to be wary of clicking on emails that ask for donations, as they could be from computer hackers, and might install malware if you click on suspicious links or download anything.From NTD.tv Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowColin FredericsonAuthor (Reporter)FollowColin is a New York-based reporter.

Advertisement Health TopicsFirst Aid, Safety & PreparednessFirst Aid For Wounds How should I apply a roller bandage to a wound? American Red Cross Secure the end of the bandage in place with a turn of the bandage. Wrap the bandage around the body part until the dressing is completely covered and the bandage extends several inches beyond the dressing. Tie or tape the bandage in place. [media id=""4e80b93a464318_30646810"" title=""Arc Figure 7_15A""] [media id=""4e80b974c3e9c4_49737351"" title=""Arc Figure 7_15B""] [media id=""4e80b993180675_48011589"" title=""Arc Figure 7_15C""] Do not cover fingers or toes. By keeping these parts uncovered, you will be able to see if the bandage is too tight. If fingers or toes become cold or begin to turn pale, blue, or ashen, the bandage is too tight and should be loosened slightly. Apply additional dressings and another bandage if blood soaks through the first bandage. Do not remove the blood-soaked bandages and dressings. Disturbing them may disrupt the formation of a clot and restart the bleeding.

This Sanskrit-origin name implies ‘fire’ or ‘fiery.’ The name is used for baby girls, but its popularity as a boy’s name is far higher. Anala maintains the same meaning and usage across genders. Some believe it can also mean ‘goddess of fire’ and ‘master of a fiery personality.’Anala, pronounced Uh-nal-uh, is a linguistically rich name that gives people a glimpse into the vibrant Hindu culture. It is a deity’s name mentioned in many Hindu scriptures, especially in the Puranas. This deity’s association is always seen with Agni or fire. Additionally, Anala is considered an attendant god and was widely revered during the Vedic period. Anala is also one among the eight Vasus and is answerable to Lord Indra.This name is also associated with ancient Hindu tradition as a female name. It is mentioned in Canto 14 of the Aranya Kanda of the epic Ramayana. Here, Anala is the name of a daughter of Daksha, who, along with her sisters, was married to Marichi, sage Kashyapa’s son. Another version of Anala is in Chapter 66 of the Ādi Parva, in the great epic Mahābhārata. Here, she is the great-granddaughter of Krodhavaśā and the daughter of Dakṣha. Analā is the wife of the sage Kashyapa in this version.Its appeal seems to have crossed the Indian subcontinent as foreign authors have used it in their works of fiction. One such example is the book Anala – A Well-lived Life by Michael Loucks. It’s a long 1563-page book and falls in the romance genre. Anala does not have any known spelling or regional variants, but you can shorten the name however you like to make it a nickname for your child.Anala thus represents the elemental force of fire. It symbolizes its purity, transformative power, and life-sustaining characteristics. It is an evocative name and a good option for you if you wish to forge a deeper connection with your roots.Anala Meaning Fiery Gender Girl Lucky Number 11 Syllables Three Length 1 word, 5 letters, 3 vowels, 2 consonants Type Short and moderately easy to pronounce How To Pronounce Anala?Pronounced as uh-na-luhThe way you pronounce a name can make all the difference.Listen to the sound of the name Anala in English.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year.

Rashi and nakshatra, which are an integral part of Jyotisha, are believed to influence an individual’s personality and life events. The following sections give you rashi-related information, such as the associated letters, elements, ruling body, quality, and nakshatra for the name Anala. These details help analyze a person’s characteristics, personality, and behavior.Zodiac Sign (Rashi)As shown in the following table, each rashi is associated with specific sounds, which are often used as the starting letters of names for newborns in Hindu families. Each rashi is represented by a figure and one of the five elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether (Space). One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Rashi (zodiac sign)Mesha (Aries)Starting letters for Mesha (Aries) rashiA, L, E, I, ORepresentationRamElementFireRuling bodyMarsQualityMovable (chara)Birth Star (Nakshatra)Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth.

(REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File PhotoBy Reuters9/3/2018Updated: 9/3/2018PrintPARIS—France’s Société Générale expects penalties relating to its dispute with U.S. authorities over international sanctions violations to be about 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion), which would almost entirely be covered by provisions.“Société Générale expects that the amount of the penalties in the U.S. Sanctions Matter will be almost entirely covered by the provision for disputes allocated to this matter,” the bank said in an update released on Sept. 3.The bank’s provisions set aside to cover penalties related to legal disputes totals 1.43 billion euros.Société Générale, which has been dogged for more than a year by a series of costly legal disputes, said it expects the issue to be settled in the coming weeks.The last case that remains to be settled relates to dollar transfers made on behalf of entities based in countries that are subject to U.S. economic sanctions.During 2017 and 2018, the bank has regularly raised the provisions set aside to cover potential losses related to the settlements. However, this is the first time the bank has given an estimate of the amount a settlement may reach.In June, it agreed to pay $1.3 billion to authorities in the United States and France to end the disputes over transactions made with Libya and over the suspected rigging of Libor, a key interest rate used in contracts worth trillions of dollars globally.As part of the process to settle the Libor case, the bank’s deputy CEO in charge of investment banking activities, Didier Valet, left in March.Société Générale paid 963 million euros in mid-2017 to settle another dispute with the Libyan Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund.Reporting by Inti Landauro; editing by David Goodman and Alexander Smith.

Paperbound, x + 296 pp. (21.5 times 14 cm), $8.95. www.OMSoul.comVolume 37, Issue 11https://doi.org/10.1345/aph.1D447ContentsPDF / ePubMoreCite articleShare optionsInformation, rights and permissionsMetrics and citationsFigures and tablesWhen patients ask whether there are any problems with sexual intercourse subsequent to elective sterilization, a common response from physicians is: “There aren't significant problems; in fact, many couples find that their sexual relations improve — because the fear of becoming pregnant is gone.” For any physician who might believe this is true (and there are many; I know, I used to be one), Sterilization Reversal: A Generous Act of Love provides a very different perspective. Since some of my colleagues actively encourage sterilization almost as a good in and of itself, this book provides a much-needed counterview.The editor has masterfully compiled a collection of the lived reality of 20 couples, who boldly tell of their decisions, their subsequent regrets, and, ultimately, their courageous recovery from what these couples now view as one of the worst decisions of their married lives. Ye t at the time of their decision to undergo sterilization, few of the couples had serious concerns or ambivalence. In fact, many had no reservations at all. Most were strongly encouraged to go ahead with the procedure — often by their spouses, family, friends, doctors, and, in some cases, even their priests. Each couple had carefully weighed the pros and cons. Each had seemingly strong, sometimes compelling, logic justifying their decisions. The reasons varied, ranging from financial worries to child care responsibilities, and fears of complications with pregnancy. For some, issues of equality within the marriage were part of the driving force: “He felt forced into it because I had endured 3 surgeries, and he saw my discomfort with pregnancy and recovery.” For others, external forces were more influential: “Tammy felt the social pressures more than I about having fewer children.”Despite their initial confidence in the perceived benefits, each couple poignantly reveals the negative impact of sterilization on their lives. In some cases, this wasn't long in coming. One spouse noted, “Almost immediately afterwards, he was very angry with me about the procedure. We discussed it, but I don't think we ever really got to the root of his anger until years later.” A single such story might be dismissed as poor couple communication; yet, the common thread in each of the 20 testimonies makes any such casual dismissal problematic. Certainly, many of the couples acknowledged ongoing stresses at the time of the sterilization (even thoughts of divorce with some), yet other couples were remarkably close and loving, with a shared faith and philosophy and few pressures, either external or internal.At some level, all thought they were acting responsibly. Ye t in time, a common negative outcome emerged in each relationship. One noted, “After the vasectomy, our focus was on self-gratification and not on verbal communication.” Another couple noticed that their sexual relationship became less satisfying, even laborious: “While we didn't fear pregnancy, our physical, emotional, and intellectual intimacy at times lacked something… I didn't connect it to the vasectomy until much later.” This same spouse's frustration at his physician is hardly veiled about the perceived harm the procedure had caused both him and their marriage: “The vasectomy is very humiliating as you expose yourself not only physically to the doctor but also spiritually and emotionally; however, the doctor involved never once talked to us about the emotional devastation caused by the procedure.”Of interest, many of the couples began their story by describing their initial hesitancy to write openly about such usually private and intimate decisions. Yet, there is clearly a passion propelling each couple to share what they now know to be true; in essence, their lives were poorer for having chosen to become sterile. Their common hope in writing is to ensure other couples might be better informed should they ever consider the option of permanent sterilization. This alone would form a good basis to make the book worth buying and reading.However, the book's most important contribution unfolds in the message conveyed by its title, indicating the remarkable gift and positive impact of the decision to undergo sterilization reversal. In some cases, the impact of the reversal was as direct and measurable as the children born — Simon, Katharine, Elizabeth, and Jonathan, to name a few. The joy expressed by some of the parents who have successfully restored their fertility is palpable. Their writing leaves an indelible impression that “pregnancy was a very special blessing for us. It felt like we were having our first child all over again… it felt like I was holding Christ! Thank you God.”Even for couples who underwent the reversal procedure but have not yet been blessed with a successful pregnancy, their peace and joy emanates from the pages: “I felt whole again” and “our communication is enhanced… our hearts are open to whatever God wants.” In every case, the couples choosing to reverse their sterilization grew closer: “We have a new appreciation for each other and have grown together in our faith journey.” In some cases, their careers and lives radically changed for the better after choosing to reverse one of the most common surgical procedures done in this country.Although most of the stories reveal that the couples became more fervent in their faith, the religious upbringing and practice of the couples at the time of their sterilization varied. Many expressed the sense that they had been moving further away from their faith. Even when this was not the case, such couples felt the sterilization had caused a chasm between them and God. Choosing to reverse the sterilization procedure not only resulted in stronger marriages for each couple, but stronger commitment to their faith.While I found the stories in this book refreshing and uplifting, I suspect that there may be barriers for some to be fully open to reading it. For example, the obvious professions of faith and frequent referencing to God by many couples in this book might cause some agnostic or atheistic readers to close their minds. Others, fearful about population growth, are likely to find the book at odds with their worldview. Still others may dismiss these testimonies as being aberrations not worthy of serious consideration. Nevertheless, ignoring the lived experience of these couples does not make their experiences any less true. As such, the very real problems identified by these couples with sterilization need be shared.In summary, I think that Sterilization Reversal: A Generous Act of Love provides an invaluable perspective for any individual or couple considering sterilization. Furthermore, I believe it should be required reading for any healthcare professional (whether nurse practitioner, obstetrician/gynecologist, family physician, urologist) to appropriately counsel and provide truly informed consent for individuals requesting sterilization.Cite articleCite article Cite article COPY CITATION OR Download to reference manager If you have citation software installed, you can download article citation data to the citation manager of your choice Select your citation manager software: (select option) RIS (ProCite, Reference Manager) EndNote BibTex Medlars RefWorks Direct import Share optionsShareShare this articleShare with emailEMAIL ARTICLE LINKShare on social mediaFacebookTwitterLinkedinWeChatShare access to this articleCreate a link to share a read only version of this article with your colleagues and friends.

Particularly in wines, polyphenols and quality are closely interconnected. Indeed, these compounds possess a critical role due to their contribution to organoleptic wine quality as color, astringency, and bitterness. The profile or the composition of certain polyphenols has been even proposed as an analytical tool for authenticity certification. In this sense, although important progress has been achieved, the understanding of the relationship between the quality of a particular wine and its phenolic composition remains one of the major challenges in enology research. But why? If there is an adjective to define wine, it is “complex.” This final complexity of a wine begins with the enormous polyphenolic variability that may be present in grapes influenced by ripening, genetic, or environmental factors, among others. Winemaking process (alcoholic and malolactic fermentation) and wine aging with or without wood contact produce endless reactions giving rise to complex transformations (copigmentation, cycloaddition, polymerization, and oxidation) of polyphenols. This chapter gathers the most relevant information about the composition, variations, and transformations of phenolic compounds from grape to wine including their influence on sensory properties.

IntroductionGrape and wine phenols represent a large family of compounds with a great diversity of chemical structures and degrees of complexity. The term “polyphenols” or “phenolics” is used to define a group of plant secondary metabolites that presents one or more than one hydroxyl (▬OH) groups attached to one or more benzene rings [1].Polyphenols are synthetized by phenylpropanoid pathway, being the amino acid phenylalanine (a shikimate pathway product) their common precursor. They can be divided into flavonoid (anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, flavanones, flavanonols, flavones, and chalcones) and non-flavonoid (hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids and stilbenes) families [2].These compounds are critically important for wine quality, due to their contribution to their sensory properties: color, taste, mouthfeel, flavor, astringency, and bitterness [3, 4]. For this reason, the understanding of the relationship between wine quality and its phenolic composition is considered, nowadays, one of the major challenges in enology research.Furthermore, fermentation, maturation, and/or aging of wine may be performed in contact with oak wood. Spontaneous clarification, slow and continuous oxygen diffusion through the oak wood pores (for barrels and casks), and extraction of many volatile and nonvolatile (mainly ellagitannins) compounds are observed. As a result, wine undergoes a modulation of its quality and complexity with regard to aroma, structure, astringency, bitterness, persistence, and color stability [5].The objective of this book chapter is to examine the key phenolic compounds in grapes and in oak wood used for the maturation of wine. Likewise, the evolution of these compounds during winemaking and wine aging and their impact in the sensory properties of wine will be discussed. Advertisement 2. Key grape phenolic compoundsThe most important grape polyphenols comprise anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, proanthocyanidins and flavonols (flavonoid family), and phenolic acids and stilbenes (non-flavonoid family). Each family can be present in their free or conjugated forms, differing by their hydroxylation level and by the substitution of the hydroxy groups (methylation, glycosylation, acylation) and even forming adducts between them (e.g., phenolic acids with anthocyanins; condensed tannins). This fact explains the great chemical diversity of polyphenols in grapes [6].It is noteworthy that polyphenolic composition in grapes is highly affected by different factors such as viticulture practices, environmental conditions (soil, climate), and pathogen attacks [7]. Although, one of the most important factors is undoubtedly the varietal or genetic differences [8] as well as the winemaking process.2.1 Flavonoid grape polyphenols: Anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, procyanidins, and flavonolsFlavonoids are basically formed by a structure of 15 carbons (C6-C3-C6) divided in 2 aromatic rings, A and B, which are joined by a 3-carbon chain that is part of a heterocyclic C ring (Figure 1). Depending on the oxidation state of C ring, this family can be subdivided in anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, or flavonols.Figure 1.General chemical structure of flavonoid family.2.1.1 AnthocyaninsStructurally, anthocyanins are mainly present in nature in the form of heterosides. The aglycone form of anthocyanins, also called anthocyanidin, is based on the flavylium or 2-phenylbenzopyrilium ion having hydroxyl and methoxyl groups in different positions.Anthocyanins are the most important natural pigments in wine grapes. These compounds are predominately accumulated in skins of red grapes during the ripening, and they are also present in the flesh of “teinturier” varieties [9]. In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that certain white grape cultivars (Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, and Chardonnay) can contain measurable traces of anthocyanins [10]. Several factors can influence the anthocyanin biosynthesis in grapes such as origin and type of the grape vine, degree of maturity, and weather conditions like temperature, water availability, or the light exposure and intensity [11].Regarding total anthocyanins, their quantities vary between 11.47 and 29.83 g/kg of dry matter (dm) in red grape skins [12] (Table 1). The principal individual anthocyanins in Vitis vinifera cultivars are the 3-O-monoglucosides (glucose linked through glucosidic bonds at the C3 positions of C ring) of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin (Figure 2). Among these, malvidin-3-O-glucoside is generally the most abundant with values of 4.12–10.19 g/kg dm [14]. More recently, He and co-workers demonstrated for the first time the presence of pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside at trace levels on berry skins of Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir cultivars [20]. Moreover, the monoglucoside forms can be acylated at the C6″ position of the glucose moiety with both aromatic (p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acid) or aliphatic acids (acetic, malic, malonic, oxalic, and succinic acid). The most common acylated anthocyanins in V. vinifera grape includes 3-O-(6″-p-coumaroyl)-glucosides, 3-O-(6″-acetyl)-glucosides, and 3-O-(6-caffeoyl)-glucosides of delphinidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin [8, 12, 14, 21]. To go further, even anthocyanin dimers (malvidin-3-O-glucoside dimer and malvidin-3-O-glucoside-peonidin-3-O-glucoside) have been identified in grape skins [8, 22]. The presence of these acetylated forms is important for the color stabilization and intensity of wines [23]. The color intensity increases with the number of substituted groups on the B ring (di-oxygenated forms are redder, while tri-oxygenated are more purple) and with the replacement of hydroxyl by methoxyl groups (i.e., malvidin has the darkest color). Moreover, methoxylated anthocyanins (malvidin and peonidin) are more stable than hydroxylated ones to environmental and viticultural factors [24]. Additionally, anthocyanins can be found as 3,5-O-diglucosides or acylated 3,5-O-diglucosides, which are considered as marker compounds of non-V. vinifera species or hybrid red grapes [25].Compoundg/kg dmGrape varietyReferencesPomaceSeedsSkinsTotal polyphenol contenta19–40.536.6–88.720.2–52.3Grenache, Syrah, Carignan noir, Mourvèdre, Counoise[13]AnthocyaninsTotal11.47–29.8211–47–29.82NDCabernet Mitos, Lemberger, Spätburgunder, Schwarzriesling, Trollinger[12, 14]Delphidin-3-O-glucoside0.44–1.110.44–1.11NDCyanidin-3-O-glucoside1.51–3.811.51–3.81NDPetunidin-3-O-glucoside0.53–1.340.53–1.34NDPeonidin-3-O-glucoside0.99–2.490.99–2.49NDMalvidin-3-O-glucoside4.12–10.194.12–10.19NDTotal acetylated3.88–10.883.88–10.88NDFlavan-3-ols/proanthocyanidinsCatechin0–0.32.14–2.420–0.3Grenache, Syrah, Carignan noir, Mourvèdre, Counoise Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Moscatel de Grano Menudo, Gewürztraminer, Riesling, Viognier, Merlot, Cencibel[13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]Epicatechin0–0.20.88–1.600–0.13Epigallocatechin0–0.050.05NDEpigallocatechin-3-O-gallate0–0.0070.06–0.07NDEpicatechin-3-O-gallate0.0030.25–0.310.04Procyanidin B10.11–0.600.14–0.170.18–0.6Procyanidin B20.01–0.840.04–0.180.01–0.84Total tannins39.1–105.862.3–167.844.9–73.0FlavonolsTotal0.03–0.630.48–0.630.02–0.05Merlot Weisser Riesling[14]Phenolic acidsTotal0.03–8.310.10–0.110.17–8.23Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Mitos[12, 14, 19]Gallic acid0.03–0.110.030.01–0.11Coutaric acid0–1.230.03–1.23—Caftaric acid0–6.970.11–6.97—Table 1.Main phenolic compounds in different grape parts (expressed in g/kg of dm).aGallic acid equivalents (GAE) per g dry weight.Figure 2.Chemical structures of major grape phenolic compounds.In general, anthocyanin concentration is maximized under nonirrigated conditions in all cultivars, but anthocyanin profile and relative distribution of individual anthocyanins among irrigation treatments are influenced principally by the cultivar. In fact, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, and Tempranillo are characterized by a major proportion of malvidin forms, while in Nebbiolo (Italian cultivar) peonidin-3-O-glucoside is the most prevalent anthocyanin [11]. Other varieties, for example, Pinot noir, red Chardonnay, and pink Sultana (white red-colored mutants), are not able to synthetize acetylated anthocyanins [26]. In consequence, the anthocyanins profile in grapes can be used as an authentication tool of varietal wines [27].2.1.2 Flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins (oligomeric proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins)Flavan-3-ols are monomeric flavonoids formed by a benzopyran unit (rings A and C) with an aromatic cycle (ring B) linked to the carbon C-2 of the pyranic cycle (ring C). The presence of two chiral centers on the molecule (C2 and C3) gives rise to four possible configurations for a single monomer. These monomeric structures may be joined together forming dimers, oligomers (3–1o units of flavan-3-ols), and polymers (more than 1o units of flavan-3-ols). All these more complex structures are so-called condensed tannins. If they are formed by (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin and their gallic esters, they are named procyanidins, while when they are constituted by (+)-gallocatechin and (−)-epigallocatechin and their galloylated derivatives, the term used is prodelphinidins [28].They are located in all grape clusters solid parts (skins, seeds, stalks) and are responsible for the stabilization of wines’ both color and sensory characteristics due to their astringent and bitter properties [29]. Five monomeric flavan-3-ols are commonly present in grapes (Figure 2): (+)-catechin and its stereoisomer (−)-epicatechin as the predominant ones in seeds (2.14–2.44 g/kg dm and 0.88–1.60 g/kg dm, respectively) (Table 1) (+)-gallocatechin, (−)-epigallocatechin, and (+)-catechin-3-O-gallate [13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].As explained above, condensed tannins are oligomers of flavan-3-ol monomer units. These units can be linked by C-4 → C-6 or C-4 → C-8 bonds, so-called B-type proanthocyanidins. A-type condensed tannins are characterized by the presence of a second interflavonoid bond by C▬O oxidative coupling (C-2 → O-7 on the basic flavan-3-ol unit) [28]. B-type proanthocyanidins, and in particular, dimers as B1, B2, B3, and B4 or trimer C1 are mainly located in grape skins (0.01–0.86 g/kg dm) and, in a lower extent, in seeds (0.04–0.18 g/kg dm) [16, 17, 18]. On the contrary, complex procyanidins (n > 3) are more abundant in seeds (58–163 g/kg dm) than in skins (45–71 g/kg dm) (Table 1).Tannins’ structure is characterized by the nature of its constitutive extension and terminal units, its mean degree of polymerization (mDP; average number of units in the polymer), and its degree of galloylation (%G; percentage of subunits bearing gallic acid esters). In the case of skins, the percentage of (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC) or also called the percentage of prodelphinidins (%P) is also used for characterization purposes. Condensed tannins with different mDPs may have different organoleptic properties. Generally, astringency increases with tannin concentration, molecular size, and %G [29]. Polymerized procyanidins are increasingly reactive with proteins and, therefore, have a more important astringent character [30]. Proanthocyanidins’ molecular size could also affect bitterness since monomers are considered to be more bitter than oligomers and polymers. Therefore, the estimation of both mDP and %G of procyanidins could be a useful parameter to evaluate the type of procyanidins present in a sample.The quantity of flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins varies during ripening being higher at flowering and lower as the grapes maturate [31]. Both flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins are the major polyphenolic compounds in V. vinifera grapes. The greatest content is observed in seeds (62–168 g/kg dm) followed by skins (45–73 g/kg dm) (Table 1). This amount can be also variable depending on the grape variety and vintage [13].Very recently, a new condensed tannin called “crown” proanthocyanidin tetramer has been isolated for the first time in grape skins of Cabernet Sauvignon cultivar. This tetramer is totally absent in seeds differentiating it from the rest of proanthocyanidins. This name “crown” is associated to an unusual macrocyclic carbon skeleton that has never been characterized before in the plant kingdom [32].2.1.3 FlavonolsFlavonols constitute a group of flavonoids, which have the peculiarity to present a double bound between C2 and C3 and a hydroxyl group in C3. They vary in color from white to yellow and possess an important role in the color stabilization of young red wines, through copigmentation interaction with anthocyanins [3], and in the sensory perception of astringency and bitterness [33].Conventionally, flavonols are present in berry skins of both white and colored grapes, and their total flavonoid content varies notably depending on cultivars and ripening stage [34]. In relation with cultivars, more quantities of flavonols have been reported, for example, in V. vinifera French varieties (Syrah, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot), than with Spanish ones (Tempranillo, Garnacha, and Garnacha Tintorera) [35]. The total amount of flavonols in grapes varies from 1 to 80 mg/kg of fresh berry, being the red cultivars regularly richer than the white ones [35, 36].Flavonols are found in grape berry skins in 3-O-glycoside forms. The main flavonols reported in red grapes are the dihydroxylated quercetin-3-O-glucoside and 3-O-glucuronide and the trihydroxylated myricetin 3-O-glucoside. In addition, other compounds such as kaempferol and the methylated isorhamnetin, laricitrin, and syringetin 3-O-glucosides have also been identified [35]. Furthermore, kaempferol and laricitin-3-O-galactosides, kampferol-3-O-glucuronide, and even quercetin and siringetin-3-O-(6″-acetyl)-glucoside have been identified in Cabernet Sauvignon grapes in lower quantities [37]. Interestingly and more recently, laricitrin-3-O-galactoside and syringetin-3-O-galactoside were reported in red grapes for the first time. With regard to white grapes cultivars, myricetin, laricitrin, and syringetin have not been identified [36].2.2 Non-flavonoid grape polyphenols: phenolic acids and stilbenes2.2.1 Phenolic acidsPhenolic acids can be classified in two main groups: hydroxybenzoic acids (C6-C1) and hydroxycinnamic acids (C6-C3). This family is found in skins, pulp, and seeds of grapes, being generally most numerous in skins (0.2–8.2 g/kg dm) (Table 1). The quantities of total hydroxycinnamic or hydroxybenzoic acids in grape skins vary depending on cultivar and origin. For example, hydroxycinnamic acids are more predominant in V. vinifera East Asian or North American grapes than in European grapes in which these phenolic acids are only present in trace levels. However, the hydroxybenzoic acid amounts are similar between cultivars [38].Individually, the most important hydroxybenzoic acids in grapes are gallic, vanillic, and syringic acids. Predominantly present in grape seeds, gallic acid is considered the most important phenolic acid (100–230 mg/kg dm), being the precursor of all hydrolyzable tannins [39]. In lower quantities, protocatechuic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acids are also present [39, 40] (Figure 2).Regarding hydroxycinnamic acids, they are principally located in skins, being p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids the most significant. It should be reminded that p-coumaric and caffeic acids can be found esterified by the glucose of the anthocyanin monoglucosides forming their acylated derivates. In grapes (mainly white) and also in wines, hydroxycinnamic acids are mainly esterified with tartaric acid forming caftaric, p-coutaric, or fertaric acids (from caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids, respectively) [18] (Figure 2).Phenolic acids, and overall, hydroxycinnamic acids can act as copigments. Indeed, they are implicated on the formation of new more stable pigments (pyranoanthocyanins) in wine and, in consequence, are considered as color stabilizer agents of young red wines, through copigmentation with anthocyanins [3]. Moreover, they are also associated with the sensory perception of astringency and bitterness [41].2.2.2 StilbenesStilbenes (1,2-diphenylethylene) are formed from two phenyl rings linked together by an ethylene bridge generating a C6▬C2▬C6 structure. The aromatic rings are generally substituted by different functions such as hydroxyl, methyl, methoxyl, prenyl, or geranyl groups. Moreover, monomeric units (resveratrol) can also be coupled, leading to the formation of more complex stilbenes. Their composition and content are extremely variable depending on different biotic (attack of plant pathogens) and abiotic factors including grape variety and ripening stage [42].In grape berries, stilbenes are mainly concentrated in skins [43]; only trace amounts are reported in seeds [44]. In addition, red varieties seem to present higher stilbene content than white ones [45]. The major stilbenes in grapes are the glucosides piceid (mean 1.3 mg/kg fresh weight (fw)), resveratrol (mean 1.1 mg/kg fw), and astringin (mean 0.5 mg/kg fw) [46] (Figure 2). Furthermore, other minor monomers were identified such as pterostilbene and isorhapontigenin [47]. Finally, different dimers as pallidol, ε-viniferin and δ-viniferin, trimers such as miyabenol C and α-viniferin, and tetramers as hopeaphenol and isohopeaphenol have also been reported [46] (Figure 2). Advertisement 3. Key phenolic compounds in oak woodOak wood is the preferred material for the manufacture of barrels, casks, or whatever derived wood product (chips, blocks, winewoods, tankstaves, etc.) used during fermentation and/or aging of wines. Resistance, flexibility, easy handling, and low permeability make oak wood particularly suitable for wine maturation and storage, in relation to mechanical, physical, and chemical properties provided by other woods [48].Regardless of the species, oak heartwood is basically composed by cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, representing approximately 90% of dry wood and acting as key structural polymers of wood matrix. The remaining 10% of dry wood corresponds to an extractable fraction, mainly consisting of phenolic compounds but also presenting low molecular weight compounds and volatile compounds. Lignans, coumarins, phenolic acids, and phenolic aldehydes may be found in the oak wood phenolic fraction, but hydrolyzable tannins are the major constituents [49].Depending on the release of gallic or ellagic acid under acidic conditions, hydrolyzable tannins may be classified, respectively, as either gallotannins or ellagitannins [50]. Gallotannins are the simplest hydrolyzable tannins with a structure consisting of polygalloyl esters of glucose. The oxidative coupling of their galloyl groups converts gallotannins to the related ellagitannins [51].Ellagitannins are the major nonvolatile extractives from oak heartwood (Figure 3). These oak phenolics have a specific structure, consisting of an glucose open-chain esterified at positions 4 and 6 by a hexahydroxydiphenoyl unit (HHDP) and a nonahydroxyterphenoyl unit (NHTP) esterified at positions 2, 3, and 5 with a C-glycosidic bond between the carbon of the glucose and position 2 of trihydroxyphenoyl unit [52]. Among ellagitannins, the monomers castalagin and vescalagin largely predominate in oak wood, representing from 40 to 65% by weight of total ellagitannins [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58] (Table 2). Six additional ellagitannins have been identified in oak wood: the lyxose/xylose-bearing monomers grandinin and roburin E, the dimers roburins A and D, and the lyxose/xylose-bearing dimers roburins B and C [64].Figure 3.Chemical structure of main ellagitannins present in oak wood.TreatmentSpeciesMonomersPentosylated monomersDimersPentosylated dimersTotal ellagitanninsReferencesCastalaginVescalaginRoburin EGrandininRoburin ARoburin DRoburin BRoburin CUntreated woodQuercus robur5.82–27.501.76–23.900.69–13.701.00–10.400.39–6.640.95–5.340.44–4.670.47–6.2913.47–91.02[54, 56, 57, 58, 59]Quercus petraea1.63–11.761.05–8.010.78–4.440.76–5.470.13–2.050.17–3.270.29–2.410.06–2.255.87–34.41Quercus alba1.19–5.290.70–2.830.29–1.380.38–2.170.31–0.700.08–0.670.13–0.830.04–0.543.48–13.14Seasoned woodQuercus robur1.43–13.000.85–10.600.77–9.200.36–6.150.09–1.910.18–2.520.09–0.480.14–1.723.93–43.97[53, 55, 56, 60, 61, 62]Quercus petraea0.90–15.910.39–11.760.39–7.980.12–5.800.05–2.730.02–2.580.04–1.840.01–1.971.98–39.77Quercus alba0.41–4.450.15–6.440.15–2.300.07–1.810.03–0.400.02–0.840.02–0.790.01–0.200.89–8.93Toasted woodQuercus robur3.60–5.440.89–1.151.80–2.390.28–0.660.41–0.470.45–0.500.17–0.200.12–0.197.72–11.00[53, 60, 62, 63]Quercus petraea1.75–3.790.36–1.460.09–2.230.13–0.590.20–0.500.16–0.440.10–0.220.03–0.173.53–8.96Quercus alba0.21–0.440.08–5.280.040.02ND0.04ND0.010.55–5.72Table 2.Ellagitannin concentration in untreated, seasoned, and toasted oak wood from the main Quercus species used in cooperage.All values are displayed in mg/g of wood. ND, not detected.Since ellagitannins are very soluble in wines and spirits, with a high reactivity, their levels in oak-aged beverages are much lower than what could be expected. When comparing both main monomers, vescalagin presents a more polar configuration that confers it a lower stability in hydro-alcoholic solutions [65]. From a sensory point of view, their level and profile may affect the astringency and bitterness of wine [66].The level of ellagitannins in oak heartwood depends on the botanical species, the geographical origin, the single-tree variability, the sampling position in the tree, the grain, and the processing of wood in cooperage, notably the type and length of both seasoning and toasting periods.3.1 Influence of botanical speciesAmong the more of 150 oak species classified in the genus Quercus, the most frequently used in cooperage for winemaking are Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak), both growing in Europe, and Quercus alba, commonly known as American white oak, growing in the United States [5]. American oaks differ from European species not only because of their mechanical properties (higher density and resistance and lower porosity and permeability) [60] but also for the chemical composition of their phenolic fraction. Ellagitannin concentration is generally lower in Q . alba than European species, which in turn show a greater ellagitannin content in pedunculate oak than in sessile oak (Table 2) [53, 55, 56, 57, 58].3.2 Influence of geographical originUntil recently, French and American oak forests have been the quintessential source of wood for cooperage. Meanwhile, over the last few years, a huge number of studies on pedunculate and sessile oaks from different European origins (Hungary, Poland, Russia, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, and Moldova, among others) confirm their prospective use for maturation of quality wines [60]. Oaks from these new European origins appear to present ellagitannin concentrations halfway between French and American oaks [5, 58].3.3 Influence of single-tree variabilityThe width of oak wood rings (“grain”) is of great importance for the choice of oak wood for barrel and cask making, since it influences the wood chemical composition and affects the contribution of oak aging to wine quality. The higher the grain size, the larger the amount of ellagitannins released and the faster that release [67]. Furthermore, the grain size also exerts an effect on the oxygen transfer ratio (OTR): the smaller the grain size, the greater the OTR, and the faster the wine maturation [68].3.4 Influence of cooperage operationsFresh wood cannot be directly used in winemaking, due to the great percentage of humidity (up to 70%), an excess of phenolic compounds, and a shortage of aromatic constituents. Oak wood conditioning in cooperage includes two stages that will determine the enological quality of wood. Both seasoning and toasting affect the structure and final chemical composition of the wood that is going to be in contact with wine.Seasoning allows, not only reduction of humidity in wood, but also fiber contraction and wood maturation. During this process, an important decline of ellagitannin content is observed due to different physical, chemical, and biochemical mechanisms involved: stave leaching by rain, hydrolytic oxidative degradation, polymerization, and fungal enzymatic activity [56]. These phenomena occur particularly in the surface of wood and, in a lesser degree, but uniformly, in the inner wood [53]. Among the different oak wood seasoning methods, natural seasoning in open air seems to be more effective than mixed and artificial methods in reducing the excess of ellagitannins [56].Toasting also induces an important modification of wood chemical composition, including an additional decline of the ellagitannin content. During toasting, castalagin is mainly oxidized in dehydrocastalagin, whereas its diastereomer vescalagin is reduced in deoxyvescalagin [69]. Similar deoxy- and dehydro-derivates have been observed for roburins A and D, respectively.Ellagitannin degradation, and in turn their sensory impact on wines, may be modulated by changing the toasting thermal profile (temperature and length) [5]. In this sense, an ever-widening range of toasting levels is available at cooperages for all oak wood products. The higher the toasting level, the greater the ellagitannin decomposition, via dimerization and hydrolysis reactions, as well as formation of copolymers with cell-wall components [64].Recently, new compounds that showed [M-H]-ion peak at m/z 1055.0631 (compound A) and at m/z 1011.0756 (compound B) have been identified as a result of thermodegradation of ellagitannins. The A compound corresponds to castacrenin E which is the oxidation product of castacrenin D, a vescalagin with an additional aromatic ring (gallic acid) to the C-1 through a C▬C bond. The levels of these compounds, found under experimental conditions and further searched in commercial oak wood, are dependent on both oak wood size and toasting method [70].But, the extraction of oak phenolics into wine depends not only on the pool of potential extractible compounds originally present in wood, determined by the abovementioned factors, but also on the wine matrix, the aging length, and the exposed wood area to wine volume ratio. Advertisement 4. From grapes to wine aging: phenolic compound evolutionDuring the grape ripening phase, the physiological and biochemical changes determine grape quality.

rapid growth phase during which the berry is formed and the seed embryos are produced. In this period, several compounds are accumulated in the berries, especially the tartaric and malic acids, conferring the acidity of the future wine. During the first growth period, several polyphenolic compounds increased like hydroxycinnamic acids in grapes’ pulp and skin and tannins and catechins in the skin and seed. The most important changes in grapes composition happen during the second growth phase (the ripening stage). Grapes switch from small, hard, and acidic berries to larger, softer, sweeter, less acidic, flavored, and colored ones. The majority of the solutes accumulated during the first growing phase remain at harvest. During the second period, the malic acid is metabolized and used as an energy source, its proportion decreasing toward the tartaric acid concentration, which remains almost unchanged. In general, the chemical composition of the final product is much more complex than in the raw material, due to the formation of new compounds [71].4.1 Phenolic compound changes during winemakingWinemaking techniques involve the extraction of juice from ripe grapes, fermentation with yeast, and changes in polyphenolic composition that occur due to the participation of these compounds in various reactions such as copigmentation, cycloaddition, polymerization, and oxidation. These reactions begin after grape crushing, followed by fermentation and aging, contributing to the sensory properties of wines, mainly color and mouthfeel sensation. The total extractable phenolic content in grapes is encountered in seeds (60–70%), in the skin (28–35%), and in the pulp (about 10% or less). In the seeds, the phenolic content may range between 5 and 8%, by weight [72].The understanding of the relationship between the quality of a particular wine and its phenolic composition remains one of the major challenges in enological research. For example, the anthocyanin fingerprints of varietal wines are proposed as an analytical tool for authenticity certification [27]. Patterns of some classes of flavonoids are under strict genetic control, and their distribution varies considerably among different grape cultivars [73, 74].Several factors impact the wine phenolic composition, including the “terroir,” the grape variety and its degree of maturation before harvesting, or the winemaking process with its specific conditions of fermentation or aging [75]. Certain technological procedures, such as addition of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and/or ascorbic acid prior to crushing the grapes, maceration, yeast strain utilization and alcoholic fermentation, oxidation, or adsorption, can also influence the levels of phenolics during the winemaking process [76]. The addition of SO2 and pectolytic enzymes before fermentation caused an increase in color intensity, color stability, total phenolics, anthocyanins, catechin, and epicatechin in a red Italian wine [77].In white grape musts, the predominant phenolic compounds are hydroxycinnamic tartaric acid esters as catechins and proanthocyanidins which are found mainly in their skins. The must fermentation of red wines is realized in the presence of both grape skins and seeds. During this process, phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins are subjected to various reactions, such as enzymatic oxidation, nucleophilic substitution, degradation, and cycloaddition of the carbonyl compounds leading to the formation of vitisins (A and B). These pyranoanthocyanins in red wine are mainly orange pigments. Moreover, the red wine color evolution and stabilization are mainly induced by the formation of polymerized pigments. The acidic hydrolysis of proanthocyanidins leads to the formation of flavan-3-ol unit or tannin oligomers with a carbocation in C4 position which can be attacks by positions C6 and C8 of another proanthocyanidins or an anthocyanin. This reaction will induce the modification of the condensed tannin polymerization degree or the formation of the polymerized pigment. These newly formed purple pigments induce the color modification of the young red wine. Moreover, polymerization through acetaldehyde between two condensed tannins or between condensed tannins and anthocyanins also occurs during the winemaking process and aging. The formation of these ethyl bridge compounds will also produce modification in the organoleptic properties of the wine and the color stabilization since the ethyl-bridged anthocyanin-tannin compounds also exhibit purple color [72]. During the red wine maturation in bottles, all these newly formed purple polymerized pigments will undergo slight oxidative reaction to slowly form some more orange pigments which together with pyranoanthocyanins are forming the color of old wine.4.2 Using oak wood during winemakingThe winemaking process involves the alcoholic fermentation of must, often followed by malolactic fermentation (MLF). When MLF is completed, the wine is subjected to different clarification and stabilization treatments and/or is stored in oak barrels for aging for a variable period of time. MLF and aging in oak barrels are two enological processes which modify the composition and sensory characteristics of the wines [5,78,79, 80]. When oak wood derivatives like chips are added after fermentation, wines seem to have a greater aging potential compared to the wines fermented with chips due to their higher ellagitannin content and enhanced condensation reactions. On the other hand, color stabilization and tannin polymerization occur faster when chips are added during fermentation, resulting in shorter aging periods suitable for early consumed wines [81]. MLF in tanks may simplify the control of the process; however, the use of oak wood during the MLF stage affects the chemical and sensory attributes of wines. In red wines, MLF container plays an important role on proanthocyanidin and anthocyanin concentration and evolution as oxygen in small quantities favors polymerization reactions among anthocyanins and tannins. Wines performing MLF in tanks present a higher total proanthocyanidin concentration (5.8 g/L wine) than that of those which accomplished MLF in medium-toasted barrels (4.9 g/L wine). The major wine glucosidic anthocyanin, malvidin, showed as well greater levels in wines carrying out their MLF (33 and 26 mg/L wine, respectively, for tank and barrel MLF). Regarding ellagitannin concentration, their content is strongly influenced by both barrel toasting and MLF container. For instance, in the case of medium-toasting barrels, castalagin was found at concentrations twofold times higher (19 mg/L wine) when MLF was performed in barrels [79]. Concerning sensory results, the MLF strengthens the organoleptic preference of wine when it takes place in barrels [79,80, 82]. In white wines, total ellagitannin concentration varied from 7.8 to 17.4 mg castalagin equivalents/L for wines performing MLF in tanks and barrels, respectively [83].4.3 Evolution of phenolic compounds during agingThe phenolic composition of wine changes along the wine aging process reflects in the color and astringency level of the final product. From 1978 to 2005 vintage for Cabernet Sauvignon wine, phenolic compounds, total tannins, and total anthocyanins varied from 1735 to 2903 mg/L, from 1.3 to 2.2 g/L, and from 15 to 123 mg/L, respectively [29]. In general, the relative anthocyanin content decreases upon aging although this chemical modification is associated with a very clear change in color. This characteristic is often used as a quality standard for aged wines. One of the main factors responsible for anthocyanin loss is the storage temperature [84]. The majority of red wines aged are in contact with oak wood, whether in form of barrels or in form of oak wood derivatives. As a consequence, their phenolic composition changes due to the addition of oak wood extracted compounds. These compounds include hydrolyzable tannins (C-glucosidic ellagitannins), aromatic carboxylic acids, and several aldehydes. Regarding wine-air interactions, barrel structure allows a controlled entrance of oxygen, which is essential to the polymerization and the slight oxidative reactions between different types of flavonoids, leading to a modification of the organoleptic properties of the wine. Indeed, wood can affect wine composition and, consequently, organoleptic properties through different mechanisms. On the one hand, wine compounds can be adsorbed onto wood surface. On the other hand, compounds, such as ellagitannins, can be extracted from wood to the wine due to the hydro-alcoholic nature of the latter. Ellagitannins can take part in oxidation reactions that may favor the polymerization reactions between flavanols and between flavanols and anthocyanins. Furthermore, they can directly react with these types of compounds giving rise to flavano-ellagitannins or anthocyano-ellagitannins [85]. The formation of flavano-ellagitannins and the β-1-O-ethylvescalagin in red wines aged in oak barrels has been reported. The ellagitannin concentrations fluctuated between 4 and 8 mg/L, being castalagin the ellagitannin with the highest concentration, followed by mongolicain A [86]. As a consequence, ellagitannins can modulate wine astringency and color through interactions with these compounds. Strong correlations have been observed between ellagitannin concentration and both antioxidant capacity and astringency sensation [5,63, 78]. The amount of ellagitannins released into the wine depends on the content in the oak wood barrel, which in turn is dependent on several factors (Section 3). For instance, after 12-month aging with woods, the total ellagitannin level revealed a large diversity of concentrations ranging from 6.3 to 26.1 mg of ellagic acid/L wine. The wine with heavy toast woods and the wine with low toast woods presented, respectively, the less and the highest ellagitannin concentrations [78]. Storage with oak can also cause a decrease in anthocyanins, catechin, and epicatechin but an increase in total phenolic content and a stabilizing effect on color [77].Besides the winemaking process, and oak wood aging, wine can be further exposed to oxygen during aging in the bottle, depending on the oxygen permeability of the closure. Because of the extremely low rates of oxygen ingress through a closure, this form of oxygen exposure has been referred to as nano-oxygenation. Oxygen transmission rates (OTR) of wine closures may vary widely depending on closure type and strongly influence the evolution of white and red phenolic composition and astringency during bottle aging [87]. Advertisement 5. Sensory impact of phenolic compounds in wine“In-mouth” sensory properties of red wines encompass multiple interacting sensations such as acidity, sweetness, bitterness, retronasal aroma perception (flavor), viscosity, warmth, and astringency. Among these, the sensation of astringency and the taste of bitterness are related to phenolic compounds.Bitterness perception is a taste recognition mediated by taste buds present in the tongue papillae. Each taste bud, consisting of approximately 50–100 taste receptor cells, is innervated by multiple taste fibers that transmit nervous signals to the brain [88]. In humans, each bitter receptor cell contains approximately 25 bitter G protein-coupled receptors encoded by a TAS2R gene family. It was evidenced by Soares and colleagues [89] that different phenolic compounds activate distinguished combination of TAS2Rs: epicatechin stimulated three receptors whereas procyanidin trimer only one. In general, in wines containing a large number of polyphenols, the taste of bitterness is attributed to flavan-3-ols and their polymers, although it is also able to be elicited by some flavonols [90], hydroxycinnamates, and benzoic acid derivatives [91].While bitterness is a gustatory sense recognized by nervous signals, astringency is an oral sensation involving dryness and puckering [92]. According to the American Chemical Society, astringency refers to “the complex of sensations due to shrinking, drawing or puckering of the epithelium as a result of exposure to substances such as alums or tannins” [93]. It has been classically postulated that tannins possess the ability to interact with salivary proteins, with or without precipitation of the corresponding complexes [94]. In fact, the name of “tannins,” originating from “tanning” of leather, has been used over decades for their capability of binding with proteins. The mechanisms of tannin-protein interactions involved different types of interaction such as the hydrophobic interactions, which are the predominant mechanisms involving the hydrophobic nature of the condensed tannin carbon skeleton and the apolar regions of the proteins. Together with hydrophobic interactions, some hydrogen interactions also occur between the carbonyl function of proline and the hydroxyl functions of phenols as well as some ionic interactions. This mechanism and thus the final astringency of wine are influenced by many factors, such as the structure and amount of condensed tannins in the wine as well as the composition of the wine matrix [95]. Indeed, the intensity and the quality of the astringency perception are influenced by the concentration of condensed tannins [96], their degree of polymerization [97], their percentage of galloylation [98], and prodelphinidins [99]. The matrix, on the other hand, impacts the perception according to its acidity [100], its ethanol concentration [101], and the presence of macromolecules such as polysaccharides. Fontoin and co-workers demonstrated that the astringency sensation of grape-seed oligomer tannins decreased with increasing pH and the percentage of ethanol [100]. For example, Cabernet Sauvignon wines having a mDP between 2.0 and 4.0 were characterized as mellow and slight astringent. Meanwhile, a rougher sensation (tannic) was perceived for wines with a mDP higher than 4.0. [102]. The analytical determination of the proanthocyanidin content and the type of subunit that is dominant in tannin chains might be a valuable tool for astringency estimation during wine aging [103]. Astringency intensity is influenced by the source of proanthocyanidin (seed or skin) and by well-defined proanthocyanidin fractions (oligomeric or polymeric). Polymeric seed fraction was perceived more astringent than the monomeric/oligomeric one, whereas polymeric skin fraction was characterized less tannic than the monomeric/oligomeric skin fraction, indicating a negative relationship between astringency intensity and % of prodelphinidins [104]. The presence of epigallocatechin units in the proanthocyanidins has been shown to lower the “coarse” perception through the increase of the degree of B-ring trihydroxylation. Furthermore, seed fraction with a higher proportion of galloyl group and a lower mDP was perceived to be bitterer than the skin fraction [105]. Both the interflavanoid bonds and stereochemistry of subunits impact bitterness sensation: catechin-(4–6)-catechin dimer was bitterer than both catechin-(4–8)-catechin and catechin-(4–8)-epicatechin [91].Moreover, astringency sensation perceived always reduces with the increasing saliva volume flow rate. A linear correlation was found between protein concentration and tannin-binding affinity. The saliva proteins, including PRP family (acidic, basic, and glycosylated), α-amylase, statherin, histatins, and mucins, show diversified ability to interact with tannins [106]. Some proteins are specifically bound to astringents. For instance, tannins and alum precipitated PRPs, while acid and alum precipitated mucins [107, 108].Ellagitannins (hydrolyzable tannins) impart an oral sensation described as astringent at relatively low threshold concentrations spanning from 0.2 to 6.3 mmols by means of the half-tongue test in bottled water (pH 4.5). Due to their lower astringent taste thresholds, hydrolyzable tannins are usually perceived as more astringent than condensed tannins (1.1 μM for both castalagin and vescalagin, compared to 410 μM for catechin, 930 μM for epicatechin, 240 μM for procyanidin B1, 190 μM for procyanidin B2, and 200 μM for procyanidin B3) [66,69, 109]. Among ellagitannins, the monomers grandinin and roburin E exhibited an astringent mouthfeel at the lowest taste thresholds (0.2 μM), whereas values for dimers ranged between 2.9 and 6.3 μM. Thus, the C-glycation of castalagin and vescalagin seems to favor the astringent sensation, while dimerization seems to reduce it [66]. When the same concentration of ellagitannins and skin and seed tannins was tested, the ellagitannins were perceived softer [104].Interaction of ellagitannins with salivary proteins has been poorly investigated up to now, probably because of their lower wine content compared to condensed tannins. Even if perceived as more astringent, ellagitannins have been noted as poorer protein precipitants than condensed tannins [94]. Soares and co-workers [110] stated that ellagitannins act as multidentate ligands cross-linking different salivary protein units, via their galloyl moieties. It is noteworthy to mention that these units are responsible for the antioxidant ability of hydrolyzable tannins; thus when complexed with salivary proteins, the antioxidant capacity of ellagitannins may be significantly impaired. At higher concentration levels, the main eight oak ellagitannins have also been observed to provide the wine with a bitter taste [66].Apart from tannins, other polyphenolic compounds present in wine have been related with the overall perception of astringency sensation or bitterness. Very recently, some works have provided evidence about the interaction of anthocyanins and pyranoanthocyanins with salivary proteins. Indeed, malvidin-3-O-glucoside, the major anthocyanin of wine, has demonstrated to interact with acidic proline-rich proteins (aPRPs) showing dissociation constants (KD) calculated by NMR of 1.88 mM [111] that can be compared to those obtained for procyanidins (dimers B1–4 and trimer C2) (between 0.4 and 8 mM) [112]. In addition, Paissoni and colleagues [113] tested the interaction with saliva proteins of the three representative of wine anthocyanins (glucosides, acetylated, and cinnamoylated) proving that cinnamoylated anthocyanins are the most reactive and also those that present the lowest perception threshold in wine model solutions. More recently, another work showed that pyranoanthocyanins (pyranomalvidin-3-glucoside, pyranolmalvidin-3-glucoside-catechol, and pyranomalvidin-3-glucoside-epicatechin) can also able to interact aPRPs with KD even lower (more affinity) than for anthocyanins (between 0.87 and 1.73 mM) [114].Concerning bitter taste, malvidin-3-O-glucoside has also demonstrated to stimulate one member of the bitterness receptor family (TAS2R7) at micromolar levels (12.6 μM) [89]. With regard to flavanols, the addition of quercetin-3-O-glucoside (0.25–2 g/L) to white and red wines resulted in a noticeable increase of astringency and bitterness evaluated by sensory analysis. In general, wines were described as smooth-tasting before the flavonol addition and became more astringent, rough, green, dry, bitter, and persistent in presence of quercetin-3-O-glucoside [33]. Advertisement 6. ConclusionsThere is no doubt that wine is an extremely complex medium and that polyphenolic compounds play an essential role on its final sensory properties. There is an inestimable chemical diversity of polyphenols in both grapes and wines. Each family can be present in free or conjugated forms, with different hydroxylation levels and substitutions or even forming adducts between them. Starting with the raw material, phenolic compounds in grapes can vary substantially depending on several factors as ripening, viticulture practices, environmental conditions, and varietal or genetic differences. Such is the case that each cultivar may be considered as “exclusive” and consequently, the resulting wine too. Anthocyanins (mainly present in skins) and flavan-3-ols and condensed tannins (mainly present in skins and seeds) are the most abundant polyphenols in grapes. On the one hand, anthocyanins are responsible of the color of red wines, and their profile can be used as an analytical tool for authenticity certification. On the other hand, flavan-3-ols and condensed tannins are key compounds due to their implication on color stabilization and astringent and bitter properties. Finally, other phenolics as flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acids are mainly known for acting as copigments. Oak wood is commonly used during fermentation and/or aging of wines. The phenolic composition of oak wood will vary depending on species, geographical origin, and grain or wood processing. In quantitative terms, ellagitannins are the major phenolic constituents of oak wood, and their level and profile may affect the astringency and bitterness of wine. Winemaking produces important changes in polyphenolic composition. In fact, phenolics participate in several reactions such as copigmentation, cycloaddition, polymerization, and oxidation. Thus, new compounds as vitisins, ethyl-bridged anthocyanin-flavanol derivatives, or pyroanthocyanins are formed. Furthermore, wine aging in contact with oak wood affects the degree of complexity of phenolic compounds. In this sense, ellagitannins are actively engaged in oxidation reactions that favor the polymerization between flavanols and between flavanols and anthocyanins.Overwhelming evidence has demonstrated that tannins (mostly condensed tannins), thanks to their ability to precipitate salivary proteins, are implicated on wine astringency. Astringency intensity, even if it is a multifaceted sensation complicated by a number of variables, is more influenced by the source of proanthocyanidin (seed or skin) and by well-defined proanthocyanidin fractions (oligomeric or polymeric). Up to now, ellagitannins’ direct impact on astringency and bitterness sensation remains still unknown. One of the major limitations of the half-tongue test used to evaluate their sensory impact is the absence of contact between the ellagitannins and the entire oral cavity. Further studies are needed under wine conditions. Additionally, recent studies highlight that other phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins/pyranoanthocyanins or flavanols may also interact with salivary proteins and bitterness receptors. Thus, a new research line in the field of sensory properties linked to wine phenolic compounds sensory properties is opened. References 1. Vermerris W, Nicholson R. Phenolic compound biochemistry.

(Jane Barlow/PA)Also in the accounts is a loss relating to fruit and vegetables after the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme (SFVS) was temporarily suspended when all schools were closed.The DHSC had already contracted to pay for produce to be delivered to schools, leading to a loss of £1.25m, which comprised distribution costs of £657,000 and produce costs of £590,000.The DHSC said it had donated £247,000 of the fruit and veg to food charities.Further losses recorded in the annual accounts include £1.1 million amounting to the value of 70% of an undelivered order for ventilators “which did not fully meet functionality requirements at the time”.The accounts said: “Consequently, the remainder of the order was cancelled. As the supplier had technically met the contract’s specification and had already incurred costs, 30% of the contract value was unable to be recovered.”During the year, the DHSC wrote off laboratory equipment valued at £663,000 following the closure of two regional testing sites and “there being no alternative options for repurposing or storing these assets”.Additionally, a stockpile of intensive care unit items was created to prevent shortages.The reports said: “A small number of items, valued at £313,000, reached their expiry date and had to be written off.”When it comes to NHS Test and Trace, DHSC has “impaired… consumables totalling £195 million in respect of items for which we have not currently identified a suitable use.”Two flights relating to the transportation of PPE from China had to be cancelled due to lack of stock availability at the time, and the £649,000 deposit for the two flights was taken as a cancellation charge, “as per the terms of the contract”.The report also pointed to “changing requirements” which meant the DHSC incurred a cancellation fee of £339,000 following the cancellation of two contracts for quarantine hotels.Interest payments were paid to a supplier totalling £1.6 million resulting from the late payment of invoices as a result of an initial contractual dispute, which ended up in the DHSC being forced to pay.The Government’s auditor, the comptroller and auditor general to the House of Commons, said in his section regarding the accounts that the DHSC was put under “extraordinary pressure” by the pandemic and had to operate outside normal processes and procedures.But he said it “was not able to manage adequately some of the elevated risks, resulting in significant losses for the taxpayer. Nearly two years later, it has not fully restored effective control over some of the inventory purchased”.“The chief secretary to the Treasury wrote to the department on 21 December 2021 confirming HM Treasury’s view that £1.3 billion of the department’s spending did not have proper HM Treasury consent and was irregular. He stated that ‘in the vast majority of cases’ this was because either the department or NHS England had spent funds without approval or in express breach of the conditions that had been set.” Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowPA MediaAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesProtesters Climbing War Memorials Could Face Three-Month Jail TermFeb 04, 2024UK’s Readiness to Fight a War Marred by Capability and Recruitment Issues, Say MPsFeb 04, 2024Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill appointed as Northern Ireland’s first nationalist First MinisterFeb 03, 2024UK and Allies ‘Reserve Right to Respond Appropriately’ After Gulf of Aden StrikeJan 27, 2024Related TopicsUKGovernmentwrites offCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

Friends Read FreeA visualisation of gravitational waves emitted by two orbiting supermassive black holes. (CSIRO, Author provided)By Paul Lasky9/26/2015Updated: 9/27/2015PrintNeutron stars – the dead stellar remnants of old, burned-out stars – are some of the most extreme objects in the universe. They weigh as much as the entire Sun, but are small enough to fit into downtown Sydney, and they rotate up to 700 times every second. Imagine that: a whole star rotating faster than the fastest kitchen blender.Astronomers know of a few thousand neutron stars, but one in particular is a stand-out. As part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array, we have been observing pulsar J1909-3744 with the CSIRO’s Parkes Radio Telescope for 11 years.During this time, we have accounted for every single one of the neutron star’s 116 billion rotations (115,836,854,515, to be precise). We know the rotational period of this star to 15 decimal places, making it truly one of the most accurate clocks in the universe.But, as we show in a paper published today in the journal Science, it was not supposed to be this way. Gravitational waves from all of the black holes in the universe were supposed to ruin the timing precision of this pulsar. But they have not.We used the Parkes Telescope to closely monitor a pulsar for signs of passing gravitational waves. (CSIRO, Author provided)Colossal CollisionsGravitational waves stretch and squeeze space, causing the distance between us and the neutron star to change. The gravitational waves we were looking for should have altered that distance by about ten metres, a tiny fraction given that this neutron star is about 3.6 x 1019 metres from Earth (that’s 3.6 with 19 zeros following)! But this should have been enough to show up in our measurements.Yet the fact that our measurements are so accurate tells us that something is wrong with the theory. This doesn’t mean that gravitational waves don’t exist. There are other facets of our understanding of the universe that might be off track.Whatever the resolution to this quandary, it is sure to change the way we understand the most massive black holes in the universe.The centre of our galaxy harbours a black hole that weighs more than four million times the mass of our sun. But this is a lightweight; other galaxies contain black holes weighing more than 17 billion times the mass of our Sun.READ MOREGravitational Waves Hunting Spacecraft to Launch Later This YearAnd we have good reason to believe that most, if not all, galaxies contain supermassive black holes in their cores. We also know that galaxies throughout the universe grow by merging with one another.Following the merger of any two galaxies, the two black holes from the parent galaxies sink to the centre of the daughter galaxy, forming a supermassive black hole binary pair. At some point, the subsequent evolution of the binary pair becomes dominated by the emission of gravitational waves.Merging galaxies caught in the act by the Hubble Space Telescope. (NASA, H. Ford (JHU), G. Illingworth (UCSC/LO), M.Clampin (STScI), G. Hartig (STScI), the ACS Science Team, and ESA (APOD 2004-06-12) via Wikimedia Commons)Ripples in SpacetimeGravitational waves are tiny ripples in the fabric of spacetime, and are a direct consequence of Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity. We celebrate its 100th birthday in November this year.When any two black holes are spiralling around one another, they ought to emit gravitational waves. These carry energy away from the system, causing the two black holes to move closer together.The sum of all the binary supermassive black holes in the universe should produce a background of gravitational waves (similar to the cosmic microwave background). It is this background that was expected to ruin our precision timing of PSR J1909-3744.Astrophysicists have made a number of predictions about the strength of the background. These predictions incorporate state-of-the-art measurements of galaxy formation and evolution, and the most sophisticated theoretical models of how the universe evolves following the Big Bang.Why No Gravitational Waves?But we want to be very clear that our lack of a detection does not imply that Einstein’s theory of relativity is wrong, nor does it imply that gravitational waves don’t exist. While we don’t know the real solution, we have a number of ideas.Perhaps not every galaxy in the universe contains a supermassive black hole. Reducing the fraction of galaxies that host supermassive black holes in the models reduces the predicted amplitude of the gravitational wave background, potentially making it undetectable by our observations.READ MOREFive Myths About Gravitational WavesPerhaps we do not understand the relationship between the mass of the host galaxy and the mass of the black hole. We use empirical relationships between galaxy and black hole masses to determine the latter. While we believe these are robust in the local universe, the black hole mergers we are most sensitive to occur billions of light years from us, where our understanding of these empirical relations is far from complete.Perhaps one of our assumptions about the process that drives the mergers is too simplistic. For example, if the centres of galaxies contain significant amounts of gas, it can act like an extra friction force, causing black holes to merge with one another quicker than expected. This would also cause a smaller-than-expected amplitude of the gravitational wave background.At the moment, each of these scenarios is equally plausible. Continued observations of pulsars, as well as observations of the distant universe with large optical telescopes, may soon allow us to distinguish between these ideas. And, one day, we may finally find the direct evidence for the existence of gravitational waves that we’re looking for.Paul Lasky, Postdoctoral Fellow in Gravitational Wave Astrophysics, Monash University and Ryan Shannon, Research Fellow, International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, Curtin University, CSIROThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)By The Canadian Press11/18/2021Updated: 11/18/2021PrintWASHINGTON—U.S. President Joe Biden appeared in no mood for compromises Thursday as he welcomed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the Oval Office, where the U.S. president offered the usual bilateral pleasantries but no hints he’s willing to budge on a controversial tax credit for American−made electric vehicles.Trudeau and Biden each sang one another’s praises before a phalanx of U.S. and Canadian reporters and cameras, a show of unity and continental solidarity before a three−way meeting with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.But when the customary shouted questions turned to the subject of the $12,500 zero−emissions vehicles tax credit—a proposed measure the Canadian auto industry has described as a potential body blow—Biden showed no latitude.“We’re going to talk about that to some extent,” he said. “We haven’t even passed it yet in the House ... there’s a lot of complicating factors.”It’s too early to assume—and highly unlikely anyway—that the proposal, which is part of the $1.75−trillion climate change and social spending package currently awaiting a vote in the House of Representatives, will emerge unscathed.Biden’s signature “Build Back Better” bill is widely expected to pass in the House, but it will get a rougher ride in the evenly divided Senate, where one moderate Democrat—West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin—has already said he doesn’t like the fact that the tax credit uses taxpayer money to pick winners and losers.Later Thursday, Trudeau, Biden and López Obrador gathered in the ornate East Room of the White House for a trilateral summit—their first since 2016.Seated at a large oval table with Biden on one side and Trudeau and López Obrador safely physically distanced on the other, the three leaders—their various cabinet entourages seated along the perimeter of the room—spoke of prioritizing the physical and economic health of their shared continent and respective residents.“Our North American vision for the future draws on our shared strengths, as well as three vibrant democracies with dynamic populations and economies, wishing to work together,” Biden said.“We can meet today and we can meet all the challenges, if we just take the time to speak to one another, by working together.”Trudeau thanked Biden for playing host and described himself as being among friends with a shared priority of “ending” COVID−19 and ensuring strong supply chains between all three countries.“We are three countries with extremely strong ties between our people, with our values and visions for the future strongly united,” he said.

The purpose of this case study is to report on a shelter camp in Greece. Method: An ethnographic case study technique was used. Data were collected via interviews, personal observations, and field notes. Analytic themes based on the coded data and personal memo writing were created. The sample consisted of the shelter camps’ living social reality. Results: Analysis revealed five thematic categories: ground rules, makeshift layout, food and drinks, children, and nursing perspectives. These were subsequently collated into a coherent “story” about routine daily life in the shelter camp. Discussion: As camp facilities had been hastily erected, the services were basic and life was harsh. The need to provide better facilities including social and psychological support for R&Ms is evident for this particular host facility. Implications for Practice: In Greece, R&Ms and staff cooperation is constantly sought as this new societal arrangement is a highly complex and volatile mix for everybody involved. Nurses have both a humanistic and a professional duty to be involved and help out. As the camp was run by the army, one could question the impact on culturally conflicting care provision.IntroductionGreece, like the rest of southern Europe, has been the entry point for thousands of refugees and migrants (R&Ms) seeking safety from war and conflict, and for some, simply “a better life.” In the peak of arrivals in 2015, sea arrivals alone accounted for 856,723 in Greece and 153,842 in Italy. Yet many thousands more arrived by land into Greece via the Greek-Turkish borders. However, despite numbers dropping the next year, they still remained high, approximating 183,000 and 181,000, respectively, for new sea arrivals alone. Furthermore, R&Ms’ influx into southern European Mediterranean countries, already affected by financial cut-backs, posed an additional burden on societies that are increasingly unable to cope with the mass humanitarian crises they confront (Abbasi, 2015; Monastiriotis et al., 2013). This has been a particularly heavy responsibility on Greek society and its economy, especially due to the long-standing economic crisis and imposed austerity measures (Economou, Kaitelidou, Kentikeleri, Sissouras, & Maresso, 2014).As Greece has been under austerity for the past decade, this has resulted in significant cutbacks in wages and public services, including health and social care sections. Average wages and pensions were cut over time by two thirds and unemployment rose from 22.5% in 2008 to 51.9% in 2016. Thus, the global recession and growing Greek debt has affected the country more than any other European country. In this respect, socioeconomic life has been affected heavily by unemployment, job insecurity, income reduction, poverty, and increase of mental health comorbidity (Ifanti, Argyriou, Kalofonou, & Kalofonos, 2013).As the broader Greek public health care sector is unable to cope with the massive influx of R&Ms, a volunteering movement has arisen in order to help. This includes various nongovernment organizations (NGOs), other social groups, and many individuals.Over the winter months of 20152016, small groups of voluntary nursing students accompanied by a nursing professor provided nursing, clothing, and food relief at the shelter camp of “Eidomeni” on the border of northern Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (where tension has been increasing). As witnessed elsewhere in Europe, not only are people hurt and property damaged, but harm is done to perceptions of refugees and to Europe’s image (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2016).Recently, new shelter camps were established in various sites on mainland Greece in an effort to defuse tension from overcrowding on the Greek islands. More specifically, in April 2016, a small group of three nursing students accompanied by their tutor from Alexandreio Technological Educational Institute visited the “Diavata” R&Ms shelter camp on the outskirts of Greece’s second capital city, Thessaloniki. This shelter camp holds about 2,000 R&Ms of various nationalities (most claiming Syrian origin, which creates more empathy with host countries, given the long-standing Syrian civil war) and ethnic groups, 580 of which are children, and of these, 200 are less than 4 years old. The main aim of this visit was for the tutors to conduct some research due to their personal interest in R&Ms’ plight. The three nursing students accompanying the tutors did not partake as researchers but used the opportunity to gain exposure to an unusual social environment with challenging health needs.AimThe main objective of this study was to explore and describe the current situation at the “Diavata” shelter camp with a perspective that relates to current nursing realities and education in Greece.SampleThis is a case study where the sample consisted of the shelter camp’s living social reality, which is a complex community of 2,000 R&Ms, 15 staff (police and soldiers), and various volunteers.MethodThis is a qualitative and ethnographic research study, in which the researcher reconstructed the meanings of the process of building cultural competencies in nurses. Data were collected via unobtrusive observations, field notes gathered on site, and interview-style discourse using interactive dialogue (via an interpreter where needed) with R&Ms, staff, and volunteers at the shelter camp as proposed by Harrison, MacGibbon, and Morton (2001). This arrangement resembles a form of qualitative triangulation. Ethical approval was granted by the Alexandreio Technological Educational Institute’s Ethics Committee.As in most ethnographic studies, the researcher in this study created and elaborated on analytic themes based on the coded data and personal memo-writing. These themes were subsequently collated into a coherent “story” about a routine daily life in the shelter camp. This narrative is by no means an overall account of all aspects of people’s lived reality. Rather, it is only a small portion or a coherent slice of the world studied, representing some aspects of shelter camp realities (Denzin, & Lincoln 2011).The analytic process required going back and forth between specific field note incidents and progressively more focused reflection and precise analyses (Etherington, 2004; Gelling, 2015).Thus, there was no research hypothesis; instead, there was no explicit formulation until the paper was concluded.In this respect, this thematic narrative was developed by stating a general topic of broad analytic concern or sensitivity to the events that occurred in the setting, that is, how perceptive nurses and students are in terms of ethnicity as a social construct. At the early stage, this topic statement pointed out a concern (humanistic interest) and a current phenomenon (mass migration), but we did not necessarily pose a specific problem or question, nor propose a formal answer or explanation. Rather, our topic (R&Ms’ well-being) identified a more general focus and helped the author identify gaps in nursing education, especially in light of cross-cultural awareness and sensitivity. As suggested by Garneau and Pepin (2015), cultural competences within a critical and reflective teaching practice can enhance nurses’ abilities in reducing health inequalities and lead to a deeper understanding of the social mandate of the wider health care arena.The Results of the VisitAfter data collection, a transition from field notes to writing this reflective ethnographic text took place. In this process, the data were “stripped off” from local scenes and their participants, from relations formed and personal doubts incurred in the field, that is, written in an objective style without an emotional and personal input from the researcher. Thus, the researcher had to reorient the field notes and interview data, scrutinizing them with a global view in order to formulate thematic categories. Thus, after analysis, the following themes emerged:•Ground rules•Makeshift layout•Food and drinks•Children (are mischief makers the world over)•Nursing perspectivesThrough this process, the researcher managed to create a document intended for a wider audience by switching from a participant-observer role in the field, to become an overt author of a polished ethnographic text as follows.Ground RulesWhen entering the main entrance of the shelter, the researcher was met by a couple of policemen monitoring those who entered and left. Some soldiers from the home forces were discretely keeping an eye out for any form of disruption. Visitors were able to enter the premises after a simple identity check. At the same time R&Ms were able to come and go freely although this opportunity was seldom taken up. This was possibly due to the fact that the shelter camp is somewhat off the beaten track and a fair distance from the city center.The police and an exceptionally obliging army officer, who could also speak Arabic and was well aware of the local circumstances, gave some basic advice. Advice included tips on how to respect people’s privacy under the circumstances, how to deal with extremely playful and noisy children, and the policies on photo and video taking.There were institutional ground rules with times set for specific daily routine events, for example, breakfast was served by staff and volunteers strictly between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. only. However, there were occasions were people would demand breakfast past the stipulated time and would strongly demand their right to food. Still, the army officer would insist on keeping timetables and, when confronted by us, replied that this was not an exercise of power on his behalf but rather it was an attempt to socially organize and inspire a daily routine to bring stability to the shelter camp and resemble real life scenarios. As he elaborated,Just like in any hotel or restaurant all over the world, there are set rules for meal serving hours.By the same token, children sent by their parents to collect the family’s food were not served but told immediately to get their parents to come with them if they wished to be fed. The same officer explained that it was inexpedient to allow for a young child to carry the food and water for whole families across the camp. When confronted that this might be perfectly accepted within their culture, he explained that again, such an arrangement would lead to meal time chaos. He added,After all, it’s not that they (adults) are so busy that they cannot come to collect their meals!Nevertheless, ground rules apply for volunteers and visitors alike, especially when they visit to deliver food or clothing. There have been cases when (probably first-time) visitors entered the shelter camp, holding bulky supplies, only to be stampeded by raucous children who saw, for example, a volunteer holding a big branch of bananas, as a trophy to be “snatched.” On the other hand, there were lay people who wanted to help but were reluctant to enter the camp. They were spotted pushing food and commodities through the camp’s wire fence, or even worse, throwing it over the top of the wire barrier. In all of these instances, the shelter camp’s army and police intervened and advised individuals that such behaviors are disrespectful, demeaning, and bound to create chaos.Makeshift LayoutThe first thing we noticed was that children of all ages played together in all kinds of open spaces including around the house-shaped heavy duty plastic tents provided by the army. Heavy-duty plastic toilet cabins and showers were lined up in various locations in the camp. Running water was available through common taps in open spaces for washing. This was not drinkable as the camp facilities were very old, being an abandoned military camp. Drinking water was clearly marked but evidently not enough for everyone. Therefore, bottled water was served regularly.We also noticed that the tents were organized in small clusters resembling makeshift miniature villages where different communities co-inhabited. Clearly, there were differences in standards of upkeep depending not only on nationality but also on willingness to stay or a strong will to move on to Northern Europe. Thus, these established communities representing R&Ms from different countries or even R&Ms from the same country but different social, religious, or regional groups (tribes) resembled “camps within the camp.”At the end of our tour, we went to the courtyard, where concerts are often given by volunteers providing a wide range of traditional music from various ethnic backgrounds. Also, we were impressed by the respect shown by the R&Ms to the Greek Orthodox chapel in the courtyard. Although the majority of the camp’s R&Ms are Muslims, they also showed respect to the Greek flag situated next to the chapel. This was not associated by fear as people were sitting next to the chapel, but still this was the cleanest part of the whole camp itself, which showed a token of respect.Food and DrinksFood and drink distribution, a social event, and some consultations on health issues are conducted daily by camp staff that is mostly onsite professional nurses. First, we went to a large, basic building built previously by the army as a common hall but had been left empty of any furniture. There, children were assembled and together with other volunteers we prepared a movie for them to watch. Blankets on the concrete floor were used as seating. Yet, as soon as everything was ready, an announcement was made saying snacks and drinks were available outside. All the children ran out of the building but the spectacle that followed was distressing. Many of the small children waiting in line for two to three biscuits and nuts and a small container of juice were pushed aside by some older children queue jumping to get four to five cartons and extra food surreptitiously hiding these items under their clothing but each time crying out loud in English: “please” or “madam.” These were the only two foreign words they used, regardless of the gender of the person serving them. Later, these children would sit aside, having a small drink out of each of the four to five juice cartoons in front of them, laughing aloud and boasting.Although adults were grateful to be saved and given temporary shelter, complaints were made about the food, which was perceived as being plain and repetitious (e.g., pasta). Also, negative remarks were made on the cooking quality of the food and drinks alike (mainly tea) as both were labeled by most women as tasteless.Children Are Mischief Makers the World OverSome children also taunted volunteers, mocking us that they had achieved more servings than intended for them. Then, the tutor (main author) with the help of an interpreter confronted these youngsters about their behavior. They were told that queue jumping or multiple collections at the expense of others is unacceptable behavior and in many Western societies is considered seriously antisocial.However, a different perception was revealed to us as the conversation progressed, and we realized that there is a strong survival drive among these children resulting in displays of solipsistic behavior. Yet, this was also a game for some, possibly in an attempt to draw attention to their existence. Finally, one young teenager challenged my authority (just for being older and being a local Greek) in an attempt to show boldness to his peers by making a hand throat-cutting gesture toward me. The researcher perceived that this could be one stage before fist fighting or quasi “gang” behavior and chose to ignore the threat, yet pondered on the reason for such a display by simply asking him “why?” only to receive an embarrassed laughter.Moreover, many children were playing war games, with weaponry made out of cardboard and sticks, while one clearly showed signs of trauma, obsessively and repeatedly aiming rocks (which made a disturbing thumbing sound) into one of the camp’s plastic toilet cabins.Nursing InputDespite the burden of austerity on the Greek health care system, nursing in Greece still remains a humanistic trade practiced with high professionalism as nurses rise up to meet the additional urgent needs of R&Ms. Nursing in the shelter camp demands basic services ranging from primary care to health promotion. These services were offered by NGOs (Medicine without Frontiers, Doctors of the World) and other international establishments such as the Red Cross. Most R&Ms would complain of headaches and musculoskeletal problems such as neck, shoulder, or lower back aches.When discussing these issues with a field nurse from a Greek NGO, the following statement was made:We (nurses) must open our eyes of the plight of humanity outside a hospital environment. Although I was trained in first aid, I was not taught trans-cultural competencies and had to learn in the field.In addition, consultancies were given regarding health promotion and basic care when dealing with everyday scenarios expected when living in the open, such as cuts and bruises or even how to deal with snake bites. Snakes in particular pose a great concern to many R&Ms as in some cases they are not accustomed to them or in other cases they have had experience of highly venomous snakes in their country of origin. Hence, advice was given on how to distinguish the only venomous species found in the area (the majority is quite harmless) and also on basic prevention by warning that spilling milk or leaving empty condensed milk cans by the tents will attract snakes. A committee of nurses and other health care professionals decided that the option of using sulfur powder or moth balls to repel snakes was not deemed safe because of the risk of children being poisoned.Also, basic advice on how to prevent and treat insect bites was also provided as the shelter camp is built within a forest area and seasonal (insects and allergies) skin problems are expected.Reflective DiscussionThe need to provide social and psychological support in shelter camps including educational facilities for the R&Ms is evident. Indeed, much of the behavior could be attributed to lack of available resources to tackle literacy problems and the suffering from war and deprivation that prevailed before reaching Greece plus the uncertainty about their future. Nevertheless, there were many children who played happily, hugging each other and laughing, with the older ones taking care of the younger ones.Overall, we had a feeling that the police and designated army was not there to guard the camp from within but rather to “protect” R&Ms from the outside world. There was an incident where an army officer challenged and eventually chased off a stranger driving slowly around the camp, with unclear intentions, near minors. Thus, the role of the shelter camp can be viewed as caring for and protecting R&Ms either by solving “in-house” conflicts or by guarding from external harassment. Also, overall order included protecting some particularly vulnerable individuals and weak social groups such as a group of two women with six children who were given premium attention.An ethnographic reflective approach for this small-scale case study is a relatively new research process within the Greek nursing literature as it is uncommon for researchers to refer to themselves. Reflective writing such as in this article can inform practice in ways that quantitative results would not and also to point out where research might be needed (Ortlipp, 2008). For example, in this case, the reader is guided in a constructive viewing of research outcomes, allowing flexibility for decision makers. This may be due to the ethnographic practice of permitting researchers to describe their personal presuppositions, choices, experiences, and actions during the research process.Furthermore, according to Mruck and Breuer (2003), a qualitative researcher should be able to describe critically a social construct, that is, a clear picture of social circumstances that stems from various choices and decisions undertaken during the research process itself. Current nursing clinical practice regarding cultural awareness, in many parts of Europe, is combined with a strong philanthropic drive to care for R&Ms. According to Reis and Costa (2014), this drive is mainly founded on an evolutionary basis, from ethnocentrism to ethnic relativism.In this respect, this exercise has been a powerful experience and perhaps a life-learning lesson for everybody involved. Setting off to the shelter some of us were, like many Greeks, somewhat biased on cultural and religious differences, and their attitudes toward us as Greeks. At the same time, we were curious to know if news broadcasts and the press relayed their situation authentically.On a personal note, this has been a challenging process as the researcher’s previous experience in this field involved visits to camps that held R&Ms who were about to be transferred to northern European countries. In this camp, the prospect of transfers was slim, and there was awareness that this camp was a more permanent destiny. In this light, the researcher felt a different perception of appreciation, as the formal camp was highly appreciative of little things such as a jacket or an extra pair of shoes, as these items were seen by the R&Ms there as an extra help for their ongoing passage to northern Europe. On the contrary, this camp being of a more permanent nature had a different atmosphere, as residents were rather in despair of long waiting with less prospect of moving on in the near future. Therefore, little treats or even expression of concern and empathy were perceived with some resentment of their dependence and predicament. In return, the researcher took time to realize that this particular group of R&Ms was in a complete different state of mind, with significantly less hope of reaching their goals.Thus, my presupposition prior to this visit was the R&Ms were always happy to receive and therefore appreciative. This research opened my eyes to the different layers of despair and degrees of hope or lack of it that these people may face in addition to the their loss of loved ones, homeland, security, possessions, social coherence, and the overall burden of trauma of war and conflict. In one single phrase from a young Syrian refugee, “I do not need another jacket, I need a ticket.”ConclusionsIn Greece, refugee, migrant, and staff cooperation is constantly sought as this new societal arrangement is a highly complex and volatile mix for everybody involved. Although this is often regarded as a “hot potato,” we feel, as nurses, that we have both humanistic and professional duty to be involved and help out.In conclusion, our visit provided the opportunity to talk to some R&Ms, who despite their hardships remained smiling and gave us the impression that they are not so different from us. After all, they too seek a better life that is peaceful for themselves and their families and far away from war and conflict.Implications for PracticeOverall, the need for social and psychological support in shelter camps in Greece for R&Ms from Syria and beyond, including educational facilities, is evident. Still, much of the behavior could be attributed to a lack of available resources and the suffering from war and deprivation that prevailed before reaching Greece. However, the findings of this first attempt to look into the living reality of life in a shelter camp in northern Greece through the “eyes of nursing” suggest that the living conditions in this setting also warrant some enhancements. This might be best achieved not only by improving infrastructure but also by enhancing the cultural competencies of the shelter camp’s workforce. A novel suggestion would be to do this not only via continuous professional education and training programs for the staff but also by getting R&Ms actively involved in this training in order to provide deeper understanding and possibly ease cultural bonding for both staff and R&Ms at a group and/or individual level.Cultural competencies for staff in Greek shelter camps might also need to be embodied at an organizational level. As the findings further emphasize, in this south Mediterranean context, cultural competence requires a strong combination of individual desire and effort to learn as the burden of austerity on the Greek health care system has ended in serious lack of organizational support and resources. Nevertheless, as nursing in Greece still remains a humanistic trade, despite these challenges, and is practiced with high professionalism, such involvement would be an important educational and humanistic contribution for nurses as they rise to meet the additional urgent needs of R&Ms.Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.FundingThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.ORCID iDDimitrios Theofanidis https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2732-4120ReferencesAbbasi K.

Koch Theater, responded to the evening’s performers with enthusiastic applause. Miles Grossman, a retired magazine and advertising professional, whose former employers include the Disney Channel magazine, said he was “fascinated and impressed” by Shen Yun. “I’m taken with it—it’s beautiful,” said Grossman. He said he was “impressed with the dancers and the rhythms, I’m very impressed with the orchestra. “The orchestra is super! What is unique for me is the mixture of Western instruments and the instruments that sound like they come from China.” The orchestra includes traditional European instruments and traditional Chinese instruments such as the suona, the gong, and the pipa.

The state troopers. And when I got up this morning and saw it was Marcus, my heart just dropped. My whole spirit, it just died,” Lewis said to WWL.McNeil was shot in the early hours of Oct. 13 while on patrol. He and four other officers got out of their cars when they noticed something suspicious. The 30-year-old suspect, identified by family as Darren Bridges, has an arrest record that goes back about a decade, The Times-Picayune reported. He was on parole at the time of the shooting. He fired at the officers, hitting McNeil.Another schoolmate of McNeil’s, Chris Quest, went to St. Augustine High School with the slain officer. They played in marching band together.Quest is now a teacher at that same high school, and McNeil’s younger brother is a student of his.“Earlier this year, we joked about the fact that we were classmates and that I’m now teaching his brother, and he told me to stay on him. Make sure he’s doing his best. And I assured him, that’s why we’re here,” said Quest to WWL.Quest said the impact of McNeil’s death affected the entire school.“This is a brotherhood. This is a bond that is unbreakable. And to lose one in any capacity... It hits hard, it hits home for everybody.”After Bridges fired on the officers, he barricaded himself in an apartment before peacefully surrendering. He is currently in the hospital, recovering from the return fire gunshot wounds he received from officers.The 29-year-old McNeil leaves behind two daughters, 5 and 2, and a wife.From NTD.tv Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowColin FredericsonAuthor (Reporter)FollowColin is a New York-based reporter.

(Aaron Favila/AP Photo)By The Associated Press7/18/2019Updated: 7/18/2019PrintMANILA, Philippines—Thousands of Philippine police officers have received administrative punishments with more than 2,000 dismissed for wrongdoings during raids where drug suspects were killed under the president’s crackdown, officials said on July 18.Communications Assistant Secretary Marie Rafael Banaag told a news conference that 14,724 police were investigated for their involvement in police drug operations that led to deaths from July 2016 until last April. She said 7,867 of them received administrative punishments for unspecified lapses.A tally presented by Banaag showed that 2,367 police officers have been fired, 4,100 suspended while the rest were reprimanded, demoted, had their salaries forfeited or deprived of certain privileges.Banaag did not say how many officers have been criminally charged for serious lapses or outright crimes committed while enforcing the crackdown, which was launched by President Rodrigo Duterte as his centerpiece program when he took office in mid-2016.Philippine police officials say about 6,600 drug suspects have been killed in raids carried out by the police mostly in gunbattles that ensued after the suspects fought back and endangered the lives of law enforcers. Banaag and other officials reported a lower death toll, more than 5,500, saying authorities were still verifying other drug-related deaths.Presidential Communications Operations Office, Assistant Secretary Marie Rafael Banaag explains a presentation during a news conference in metropolitan Manila, Philippines, on July 18, 2019. (Aaron Favila/AP Photo)Last year, a Philippine court found three police officers guilty of killing a student they alleged was a drug dealer in the first known such conviction under the crackdown.The court ruled the officers murdered Kian Loyd delos Santos during a raid in Caloocan city’s slums in the Manila metropolis and rejected the policemen’s claim that the 17-year-old fired back while resisting arrest. Delos Santos’s family and witnesses testified in official investigations that he was shot in a dark alley near a creek as he pleaded for his life.Delos Santos’s killing and that of a South Korean was allegedly strangled to death by an anti-drugs officer in an extortion attempt prompted Duterte to briefly suspend the drug crackdown amid outcries.Undersecretary Severo Catura, executive director of the Presidential Human Rights Committee secretariat, talks in front of a slideshow presentation during a news conference in metropolitan Manila, Philippines, on July 18, 2019. (AP Photo/Aaron Favila)National police chief Oscar Albayalde said criminal complaints will be filed separately against at least two officers after a 3-year-old girl, Myca Ulpina, was killed in a police raid in late June in which her father, a drug suspect, was gunned down along with another civilian and a police officer in Rodriguez town east of Manila.“There are certain flaws probably in what happened during operations but these are actually being addressed,” Undersecretary Severo Catura, an official dealing with human rights issues, said in the news conference. “That’s why we are saying here that however we’re concerned with regard to apprehending criminals, we’re also that concerned with regard to ensuring that the rule of law is followed.”He added that more than 200 policemen have been killed and 700 others wounded in drug raids—statistics that Duterte himself has often cited to counter allegations by human rights activists that police have killed suspects beyond the law because they violently resisted.Banaag said it was the first time authorities disclosed the full extent of police who have been disciplined for lapses in the anti-drug crackdown.Former Commission on Human Rights chairwoman Loretta Ann Rosales, however, said the high number of erring enforcers involved in raids where lives were lost in alarming levels should prompt the government to immediately suspend and review the crackdown.“It’s terrible, it’s alarming, it’s unconscionable,” Rosales said.Duterte had rejected those calls and warned drug suspects that his campaign would be more dangerous in the final three years of his six-year presidency.By Jim Gomez Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowThe Associated PressAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesWorld Shares Follow Wall Street Higher as Japan’s Nikkei Nears Record HighFeb 16, 2024Lyme Disease Case Counts in the US Rose by Almost 70 Percent in 2022 Due to a Change in How It’s ReportedFeb 15, 2024Power Outages Hit Boston Transit System During Morning Rush Hour, Stranding ThousandsFeb 15, 20242 Chinese Fishermen Drown After Chase With Taiwan’s Coast Guard, Which Alleges TrespassingFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsPhilippinesdrugCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

We might survive if deprived, but we won't be well. (Aleshyn_Andrei/Shutterstock)By Monica O’Shea2/11/2024Updated: 2/11/2024PrintX 10:00A new University of Melbourne report shows younger Australians between 15 and 24 are more lonely than elderly Australians over 65.The research considered data from 2001 to 2021, tracking more than 17,000 people in over 9,000 homes.Researchers found that from 2001 to 2009, those over 65 were the loneliest, but by 2021, this trend had reversed.Co-author of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) study Ferdi Botha said there was a “clear trend” of younger people becoming lonelier and feeling more isolated.“If there aren’t actions taken or policies implemented to intervene, we may see loneliness and psychological distress increasing in the younger generations and this may lead to lower mental and physical wellbeing and other wider societal issues,” he said.Mr. Botha noted loneliness rose during the COVID-19 pandemic years of 2020 to 2021, but there was already an existing long-term trend among young people.Related StoriesSan Mateo County 1st in US to Declare Loneliness a Health Emergency2/6/2024Loneliness and Insomnia Linked to Work With AI Systems6/18/2023“Loneliness increased in the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, but for young people, there is a longer-term trend increase apparent. It may be that this is partly connected to growth in smart phones and social media use,” he said.Women in the 15- to 24-year-old age group were found to be the most lonely, with a mean loneliness score of 3.3, while men had a score of 3.0. Meanwhile, among women and men in the 65-year-old and over age bracket, these scores were 2.6 and 2.4 respectively.“It used to be the case that older people were most lonely, but there is a turning point around 2008 to 2009 when we see rates of loneliness for the 15 to 24 age group start to rise. There has been a continuous increase since then,” Mr. Botha said.Explaining the rise in loneliness, Mr. Botha observed it could be that young people are now more likely to “report and admit they have emotional issues,” adding “That’s a good thing.”“Higher levels of loneliness may have to do with younger people not having as many friends now. Perhaps young people today don’t have the same levels of social connections that their parents or grandparents had at that age,” he said.“Social media can also make you feel very alone—you scroll through people’s social media accounts and everyone is at a party or seems to be having a great life and there you are, at home and alone.”Psychological Distress LevelsThe researchers found psychological distress levels fell as people got older. Youths between 15 and 24 had the highest distress scores on average in 2021.They also found that overall psychological distress has risen over time, according to the data.Women were more psychologically distressed than men between 2007 and 2021. In men, psychological distress rose by 51 percent in this time frame. However, among women, it rose by 63 percent.Psychological distress in young people aged 15 to 24 rose to 42.3 percent in 2021, more than double the 18.4 percent recorded in 2011.The study also found 14.1 percent of people aged over 15 have tried electronic cigarettes and vaping devices.Further, it found that marriage has fallen from 56.3 percent in 2001 to 50.3 percent in 2021. De facto relationships have increased from 9 percent to 14.7 percent in this timeframe.

(Warren County Regional Jail via AP)Doug Stafford, a strategist for Paul, said that Omar showed with the promotion of the missive that she supports violence.“It was nice of her to provide even more evidence that she is a person with vile, anti-American beliefs and values, who apparently also supports violence for political disagreements,” Stafford told the Gateway Pundit.Sergio Gor, part of Paul’s team, said on Twitter of Omar retweeting Arnold: “Shameful behavior from one of the LEADING voices & faces of the dem party. Why is @IlhanMN retweeting this abhorrent tweet? We should never tolerate violence or promote it!”Omar’s shared tweet remained up on July 30, some 24 hours after Arnold first tweeted it. Neither he nor Omar has apologized. While Omar hasn’t responded to the criticism, Arnold told a critic he supports a “rematch” between Paul and his attacker.Paul’s OfferOmar’s promotion of Arnold’s celebration of violence came after Paul offered her money to travel to Somalia, where she was born.He said that Omar was “ungrateful” for what America has given her.“I’ve met people who have come here from behind the Iron Curtain. They got away from communism, they’re some of the best Americans we have, because they really appreciate how great our country is, and then I hear Representative Omar say America is a terrible place,” Paul, a known Trump ally, told Breitbart.“Well, she came here and we fed her, we clothed her, she got welfare, she got [schooling], she got healthcare, and then, lo and behold, she has the honor of actually winning a seat in Congress, and she says we’re a terrible country? I think that’s about as ungrateful as you can get.”Paul said that he would chip in for Omar’s plane ticket to Somalia.“I think she can look and maybe learn a little bit about the disaster that is Somalia—that has no capitalism, has no God-given rights guaranteed in a constitution, and has about seven different tribes that have been fighting each other for the last 40 years,” he said.“And then maybe after she’s visited Somalia for a while, she might come back and appreciate America more.”From NTD News Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowZachary StieberAuthor (Reporter)FollowZachary Stieber is a senior reporter for The Epoch Times based in Maryland.

(Bill Cox/The Epoch Times)By Bill Cox10/16/2012Updated: 10/1/2015PrintDespite McMahon’s century for the Optimists, Shaffi’s Vagabonds took the lead in Hong Kong cricket’s Sunday League last weekend when they beat HKCC, but they have played an extra game than their nearest rivals. Hong Kong Cricket Club (HKCC) Optimists hosted Shaffi’s Vagabonds Cricket Club at the HKCC Ground last Sunday Oct 14. The match was an exciting, high scoring affair. The Optimists, losing the toss, but batting first, were all out for a total of 283 off 49.2 overs. All of the first five batsmen made useful contributions, but it was T.J. McMahon who scored 120 before being caught out that really set the innings alight. C.R. Williams took three wickets for 56 runs off his 10 overs. In reply, the Vagabonds scored 286 for seven wickets to win the match with two overs to spare. KCC vs LSW It was both Kowloon Cricket Club (KCC) Infidels and Little Sai Wan (LSW) Knights first match of the season when they met at the Kowloon Cricket Club last Sunday. The Knights batted first and struggled early on, losing four wickets for 66 runs, but from that point, Waqas Khan batting at No.5, held the innings together and his seventh wicket partnership of 80 runs with Furqan Tahir set the visitors on their way to a respectable total. Khan made an unbeaten 64, with the team score ending at 212 for nine wickets off 49 overs. There were three run-outs and the other wickets were shared among all of the bowlers, but the best performance was by Ankur Sharma who took two wickets for 40 runs. LSW’s 14-year-old up-and-coming, left-handed opening batsman, Niraj Patwari, who studies at the Delia Broadway School, Mei Fu, Hong Kong, discussed his cricket with The Epoch Times. Unluckily, he was caught out without scoring. “I have played for the club for three years and have scored seven 50s,” said Niraj. “It [the ball] was swinging away. I went to drive, but it hit the outside edge and I was caught out,” he explained. The Infedels put up a poor batting performance in reply and could only reach 78 runs off 32 overs before being bowled out. The Knights winning the match by 134 runs. The only bright spot of the batting was 18 runs scored by Brendan Smallbone. There were good bowling performances by Niaz Ali (three wickets for 26 runs), Mohammed Gazanfar (two for four) and Waqas Khan (two for six). Niaz Ali, captain of the LSW team, was pleased with the result. “Good win, good teamwork,” Ali commented to The Epoch Times. “It’s a young team and really good work. All of the middle order did well, especially Waqas [Khan] who played really well and the guys in the lower order all chipped in, that was the main thing,” he explained. “The bowlers were on target, we had a plan worked out, we stuck to our plan and definitely it came good for us.” League Standings: Vagabonds, having played two matches now, heads the Hong Kong Cricket Association Karp Sunday Championship League ladder with nine points, while LSW Knights, KCC and USRC/Millennium are all equal on five points after one match. Next week: HKCC Scorpions host LSW JKN at HKCG and USRC/Millennium play Pakistan Association AMSUA at Mission Road on Oct 21. The Epoch Times publishes in 35 countries and in 19 languages.

Two variants were done. The first variant I did together with my daughter. The second variant is a printable version (I did patterns in a photo editor and printed them out, all pattern are available to download).Materials are really simple:The main one is a box of tea bags which is more than easy to buy in any local supermarket.Paper, color markers/pens/pencils, an adhesive (double-sided tape is comfortable to work with), scissors.And of course a good mood because this gift is gonna be given to someone you love!Here is my video tutorial with all details: { ""id"": ""3763377"", ""alt"": """", ""title"": """", ""video_link"": ""https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJXpGLQTang"", ""youtube_video_id"": ""DJXpGLQTang"" } { ""width"": 634, ""height"": 357, ""showRelated"": true } And a photo overview below:Step 1: Take A4 paper (I use thick paper but copy paper may be also ok), cut it into rectangles. My rectangles (tea tags to be) are 3,5 cm x 9 cm. Step 2: Fold them in half and cut off edges to make a tea bag shape. Step 3: Let your kid decorate the tea tags. Step 4: Take a ready tea bag, remove the tag and adhere your tag with double-sided tape. Step 5: Now let's make a box. Take a tea box: Step 6: And undo it: Step 7: Take thick paper A3, fix the box in place with a masking tape, trace the outline with a pencil and cut out. Step 8: Repeat all folds and cuts using a ruler and scissors (or an empty ball pen). Step 9: Fold up a box and glue where necessary, Step 10: You may decorate a fresh-made tea box together with a kid.Once the box is ready, the tea bags are ready, place tea bags in the tea box. Also I recommend to wrap the box with a clear plastic to make it look even better. So, this project is nice to make with kids but I also made printable patterns of tea tags (you or kids may write warm wishes on them).

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)By Ken Coates11/5/2020Updated: 11/5/2020PrintCommentaryIt will take weeks, if not months, for the U.S. election results to be finalized. While the world waits nervously, the American political world will be engulfed in a tsunami of recriminations, second-guessing, finger-pointing, and introspection.For a nation that appears to have produced the worst possible results—a fuzzy presidential election, a GOP–Democratic split between the House and the Senate, and a highly mobilized African American population who saw their dreams of political attention dashed—the struggle to understand the election will be equally divisive and unrewarding.The major problem with the fall 2020 election is that nothing appears to have worked right, sowing the seeds of political dissatisfaction that could resonate for years if not decades. Here are a variety of ways in which the U.S. political system suffered near total organ failure.PolicyThe U.S. electorate begged for real policy in 2020, in areas as diverse as pandemic management, innovation strategies, economic renewal, climate change, rural revitalization, poverty amelioration, race relations, policing, the management of dissent, and a resurgent China. What we got instead was thin rhetoric and emotion from both sides.The progressive wing of the Democrats brough forward dramatic policy proposals, but Joe Biden and Kamala Harris pushed these concepts (like the Green New Deal) into the electoral shadows. President Donald Trump spoke often about what he would not do if re-elected, but his policy book was distressingly thin. The 2020 election was waged over values, thinly described, and not ideas.US and International MediaThe media coverage of the 2020 election was far from dispassionate and professionally disengaged, and they wore their contempt for President Trump on their front pages. The smaller number of media outlets, such as Fox News, that supported President Trump, in turn, took a similar approach to the treatment of the Democrats. In the days leading up to the election, with some unenthusiastic hedging of bets, the vast majority of media commentators assumed Biden would win.Election night coverage showed how little the professional analysts understood what was going on in the country and how disconnected the media are from the main currents of political thought in the United States. In the end, the core point is that the U.S. media, in particular, neither leads, reflects, nor influences the public will in the United States.Election PollingFor the second U.S. election in a row, and with other international examples, the polling industry let the side down. Despite the expenditure of tens of millions of dollars on professional polling, the results didn’t mesh with the forecasts. There were, obviously, points of overlap and convergence between votes and polls, but as a guide to voter intentions, the polls were more misleading than helpful. As an after-the-fact description of what happened, in contrast, sophisticated polling can help explain the inexplicable and the unanticipated. As a predictive enterprise, however, we may have seen the last of heavy reliance on polls.MoneyFor several decades, commentators have decried the growing importance of money in U.S. politics. The amount of money is obscene in financial and political terms, particularly when the expenditures by the political action committees and super PACs are added to the mix. But the spending was not very effective. Surprisingly, the Democrats mobilized tens of millions of dollars for key districts, only to produce disappointing results. Massive sums were spent to defeat—or support—President Trump.It may be increasingly difficult to get donors to write so many big checks in the future. The failure of big money may convince millions of small donors to stop responding to the endless stream of fundraising emails.Many people made millions of dollars off electoral processes that, in the end, had surprisingly little impact on political outcomes. At some point, an enterprising journalist will follow the money and find out how the political donations were spent, often to little positive effect.Star-PowerThe Democrats did an excellent job of rounding up celebrity endorsements, including from many athletes, musicians, and television and movie stars. The admirable efforts by professional athletes to get out the vote probably did convince more people to go to the polls but didn’t produce the clearly desired Democratic sweep. The messages from the stars played well with the Democrats’ political base, but failed to sway close to half the voters in the United States. By shedding all pretense of political impartiality, and by lining up so strongly against almost half the American electorate, they have managed to politicize popular culture and professional sports in a way that will resonate for years.Ridicule and ScornThe 2020 strategy emphasized political ridicule at a remarkable level. President Trump dumped endless scorn on former Vice President Biden, but almost half of all American voters didn’t reject the Democratic candidate on account of the harsh comments. Biden, in turn, described the president in consistently derogatory terms. But, again, the verbal abuse didn’t stick, as the president’s share of the popular vote suggests. This applies to the media as well. The anti-Trump contempt of virtually all TV comedians would, in historical circumstances, probably have been enough to turn the election. That didn’t happen this time. People watch and listen to the critical attacks, but the attacks clearly didn’t sway the election.IntelligentsiaSince the election of Donald Trump in 2016, the academy has wrestled with the Republican president, his erratic behavior, and his quixotic policies. In the hypersensitive world of cancel culture and exceptional concern about ethnicity, race, gender, and human sexuality, Trump represented the antithesis of the value system in the university and college system. The collective academic effort to get rid of Trump was more than palpable; it had become a central pillar of intellectual engagement. And despite hundreds of academic speeches, lectures, op-eds, books, scholarly articles, and other interventions, the political needle in the United States barely budged. While Trump and Republicans railed against the perceived left-wing bias in the academy, ironically it appears that they over-estimated the influence and impact of academic interventions.Political PartiesThe two main parties—the Democrats and the Republicans—used to be the foundations of American political stability. They varied little in substantive policies, moderated regional and other differences, and provided a counterbalance to the aspirations of presidents, senators, congressmembers, and special interests. They no longer serve that function.The Democrats are bitterly divided among themselves, united temporarily by a hatred for President Trump. The Republican desire to hold on to power caused many key leaders to surrender their independence to Donald Trump.Instead of being a source for constructive ideas and political moderation, the parties have become ideological battlegrounds (the Democrats) or facilitators of a strong leader (the GOP). It’s not clear that they’re deeply connected with the American people, and they don’t appear to be outlets for any electoral aspirations other than self-interest.African-American MobilizationThrough 2019–2020, the U.S. election was going to be about the political redemption of African Americans. This was the first test of Black Lives Matter and came in the wake of countless public attestations that animosity toward African Americans had been relegated to the past. African Americans mobilized around the call to action—led by professional athletes, actors, thousands of African American leaders, school kids, and community activists. And, even if Biden emerges as the eventual winner, it was really all for naught. Almost half of the American electorate chose not to rebuke a president who apparently stood in the way of the improvement of life opportunities for African Americans. It’s hard not imagine a withdrawal of African Americans from electoral politics and a growing sense of dissatisfaction with the American status quo.Election MachineryThe United States has one of the strangest national electoral systems in the world. Put aside the unusual Electoral College system and consider instead the absence of a national electoral system. Focus on the fact that counties, not states and not the U.S. government, run elections. The 2020 election was the culmination of thousands of local-level electoral processes. The complex web of rules, procedures, operations, and management styles creates confusion and uncertainty. It’s hardly a top-flight demonstration of a democratic election, and it’s revealed structural weaknesses in U.S. politics.The CourtsIn the Bush–Gore election of 2000, the crucial decision was made not in the ballot box but by the Supreme Court. In the ultra-tight 2020 election, and with Trump and his supporters demanding judicial protection, the courts will once again likely provide for a continuation of the campaign into the coming weeks.With President Trump having filled many of the nation’s courtrooms with Republican-friendly judges, the assumption is that the courts could provide the GOP candidate with further support. To the degree that this is tested—and true—it’s a degradation of the credibility and integrity of the legal system in the United States.There’s probably too much to hope that the United States will wake up, post-election, and alter the controversial processes that lie ahead. As the country stares into the black hole of presidential uncertainty, and with the Republicans narrowly holding the Senate, the political quagmire of 2020 is certain to spread into 2021 and beyond.The United States suffered a system breakdown in November 2020 that brought to the surface the vulnerabilities and shortcomings of a deeply flawed political structure. Uncertainty reigns supreme, and prospects for greater political chaos, disharmony, and conflict loom over the United States and the whole world.Ken Coates is a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and the Canada research chair in regional innovation at the University of Saskatchewan.Views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Epoch Times.

But there is an enigma to this discovery—the ring appears to be kinked.Friends Read FreeBy Christy Su7/19/2011Updated: 10/1/2015PrintThe Herschel Space Observatory has revealed for the first time the entirety of a cold dusty gas ring near the center of the Milky Way. But there is an enigma to this discovery—the ring appears to be kinked. The icy gas formation is 600 light-years away and previously only a few portions could be seen. The dense ring is mixed up with dust, and stars are forming here. Herschel allowed scientists to see the whole ring by detecting sub-millimeter light, which shines through the dust that is obscuring parts of the Milky Way. It can also see the coldest objects in our galaxy. What surprised the astronomers is that the ring looks like an infinity symbol and is torqued at the center, giving it a two-lobed appearance. “This is what is so exciting about launching a new space telescope like Herschel,” said Sergio Molinari at Rome’s Institute of Space Physics, in a press release. “We have a new and exciting mystery on our hands, right at the center of our own galaxy.” Scientists believe that Andromeda, our neighboring galaxy, may be influencing the Milky Way’s activity through gravitational disturbances. It is unclear why the center of the ring is not exactly at the center of our galaxy, which is believed to be around “Sagittarius A*,” where a black hole can be found. “There’s still so much about our galaxy to discover,” said co-author Alberto Noriega-Crespo, at NASA’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology, in the release. The findings were published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

(The Epoch Times)By Fang Xiao11/10/2007Updated: 11/10/2007PrintChinese leaders were embarrassed into silence when an active Chinese Communist Party official published an open letter highly critical of them, said a former newspaper reporter in China. “Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao haven’t responded to the open letter Wang Zhaojun wrote them on October 22. This means they are embarrassed by it just as they are by the campaign of people quitting the CCP,” commented former reporter Li Yuanlong. Hu and Wen haven’t responded to the open letter in public. Li said, “Hu is very conservative and won’t address the public about the letter. Hu can’t really say much because if he is against what Wang said in the letter, that'll turn him against the people. Hence what Hu can do is, just like treating the campaign of people quitting the CCP, pretend nothing happened.” “In my opinion, during Hu’s term, it is impossible to have substantial progress in the Falun Gong issue, the June 4th Massacre, political, economic, and medical system reform,” added Li, “Many people were blindly optimistic when Hu and Wen took over. I didn’t think much of ”Hu & Wen’s new politics“ at the time because they and previous leaders all come from the same dictatorial party and are all brainwashed by the same party culture. In some ways, Hu is worse than others. For example, Hu often goes to worship at the (1)”Holy land of the Communist Party.“ One can see he is very conservative and has no idea what the rest of the world is doing and what direction China should take. He does everything to maintain the dictatorship.” Wang Possesses Characteristics of Courage and Conscience After reading Wang’s open letter Li said, “Being a standing member of a Provincial Political Consultative Committee, Wang is a man of courage and conscience- he couldn’t have written this letter without either. In the letter, Wang mentioned sensitive issues such as Falun Gong, the June 4th Massacre, and environmental protection.” “Every year in the Political Consultative Conference, issues in Wang’s letter are unlikely to be discussed at the conference. Being a member, he is truly patriotic and everything he’s bottled up for years exploded. His letter won applause from so many people because everyone is suppressed under the rule of the CCP.” “Culprits Who Started Suppression Against Falun Gong Should be Punished” Wang calls for the immediate stop to the suppression of Falun Gong in his open letter. He then suggests punishing those who initiated the suppression and offering victims state compensation. Li talked about his own personal experience with Falun Gong, “When I was imprisoned in the Guizhou National Security prison, an inmate told me he had personal contact with Falun Gong practitioners in the prison since 2005 and felt they are very nice and benevolent people.” “During the two years I was in prison and after I was released, I can say, except for a few very muddle-headed people, most people don’t have ill impressions of Falun Gong. People generally say the practitioners are kind and do not endanger society.” Li continued, “Wang mentioned to punish those who started the persecution against Falun Gong, I agree. Killers should be punished by the law. Having the CCP redress Falun Gong is like letting the killer redress the one who was killed; it is absolutely of no meaning.” Li is a former reporter for Bijie Daily based in Guizhou Province. Li published four articles on overseas websites and was sentenced to two years for subversion. He was released on September 24, 2007. The four articles he published are “A one-hundred-year-old man joins the CCP,” “Adding the U.S. Passport to Your Thoughts,” “Born Commonly and Die Pathetically,” and “A Secretary Who Continues His Meeting After Being Notified of His Mother’s Death.” (1) The “Holy land of the Communist Party” is Yan An City in Shaanxi Province, where the CCP hid during the Sino-Japan war. It is the place where Mao consolidated his power and finally took over China.

Effective Jan. 15, every household is allowed to buy only one home in the central urban area of Wuhan. Friends Read FreeBy Wang Zhen2/6/2011Updated: 2/7/2011PrintA new round of home buying restrictions has been extended to second and third tier cities in China. The cities of Zhengzhou (Henan Province), Taiyuan (Shanxi Province), Wuhan (Hubei Province) and Kunming (Yunnan Province) have recently released details of the new restrictions. Qingdao and Jinan in Shandong province confirmed that they will impose restrictions later, while Changsha (Hunan Province), Xi’an (Shanxi Province), and Nanning (Guangxi Province) are believed to be close to introducing them. Effective Jan. 15, every household is allowed to buy only one home in the central urban area of Wuhan, a second-tier city, regardless of its size, according to the notice originally posted onto Sina.com’s real estate section. The average sales price for commercial residential housing in Wuhan last year was 6,184 yuan (US $938.96) per square meter, an increase of 17.44 percent compared with the year before. When the news reached Qingdao, Sun, on staff with the Good Friend Housing Service Company told Voice of America (VOA), “Qingdao’s housing price will only rise, not fall, because no more houses can be bought in good locations. This restriction can only target high-priced homes and will even be extended to the suburbs. Residential housing can only rise, and it will not fall until the next century. As for those high-quality houses, costing 30,000 to 40,000 yuan (US $4,556.58 to $6,075.25) per square meter—even if you lower it to 20,000 yuan (US $3,038) people still cannot afford it.” The Chinese Academy of Sciences predicted that in 2011, house prices in China will continue to rise by as much as 12.7 percent. It is expected to be linked with China’s consumer price index, which is estimated to rise 3.7 percent. Most Chinese cannot afford residential homes, yet low-rent and other economical houses that are supposed to assist low-income families have been snapped up by the rich. The ruling Party’s mouthpiece Xinhua News reported that there’s no telling how many “distinguished” people are living in these low-income houses; some BMW and Mercedes-Benz owners are also trying to acquire these kinds of houses. Close to 90 percent of the applicants for low-income houses in Shanghang of Fujian province in 2010 are public servants. Some of their names even appear multiple times on the applicant list, according to the VOA article. In 2010, the State Council launched a series of housing market regulations; in addition to home buying restrictions, there were also measures including: suspending loans for the purchase of a third property, increasing the down payment, and limiting the maximum loan amount on residential housing. Yet having so many regulatory policies still cannot keep rising prices under control. Chinese media reported that officials from China’s Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Construction said in an internal meeting in mid-January that they would pressure local officials to impose restrictions. Financial commentator Ni Jinjie wrote that, based on the effect of the regulations in 2010, the measures are merely a formality. Since the root cause of uncontrollable house prices is that local governments are important beneficiaries, naturally the regulations were not implemented strictly. Takings from land sales soared 70 percent last year, and this form of easy lucre has become the most important source of revenue for many local governments. Ni’s article stated that currency flooding and land financing are the two main factors supporting China’s real estate bubble. In the past two years, China’s state-owned banks gave out 17 trillion yuan (US $2.58 trillion) in new loans; during the time when the real economy was sinking and manufacturing margins were thin, this money flowed into real estate. For local governments, land is still their largest source of revenue. Since local officials’ promotion is tied to the local GDP performance, “land sales” weigh much more than people’s livelihood and affordable housing. Liu Feiyue, in charge of the Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch website, told VOA that the authorities did not dig out the root of the problem, because the government itself is the beneficiary of high housing prices. “The most fundamental problem is the profit chain,” Liu said. “Not only local governments, but the central government also benefits tremendously from it.” [email protected] Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowWang ZhenAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesChinese Try to Cope with Soaring PricesNov 08, 2010Chinese Anti-Japan Student Protests Get Anti-Regime FlavorOct 29, 2010World-Famous Waterfall Drying Up Due to Severe DroughtMar 28, 2010Related TopicsCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

Rogers won Stage 11 on My 21, 2014. (www.tinkoffsaxo.com)By Chris Jasurek5/21/2014Updated: 5/21/2014PrintTinkoff-Saxo Rider Michael Rogers attacked on the 28-km descent of the final climb of the 249-km Stage 11 of the Giro d'Italia, and the three-time World Time Trial Champion showed his form, holding off the entire peloton until the finish line to take the stage win.Rogers had been having a terrible year: he had been suspended for testing positive for the banned chemical Clenbuterol, which he picked up eating contaminated meat in China. He was cleared on appeal, but lost almost the entire early racing season.The 34-year-old Australian crossed the finish line ten seconds ahead of the peloton after nearly six hours on the bike. He could have won by a bigger gap, but since he is not a GC contender, he opted instead to slow down and savor the victory“That was certainly a beautiful moment,” Rogers told beIN Sports. “The team tried really hard with Nicolas [Roche] and Ivan [Rovny] up front. Unfortunately the break was brought back but I was able to take advantage of that.“It was a spur-of-the-moment move. I saw the GC contenders all looking around at each other so I took a chance and it paid off.”Stage 11 featured a par of Cat 2 climbs, one 65 km in and one 30 km from the finish. Many people predicted a breakaway win, but few predicted a late attack on the final descent would be successful.Despite repeated attacks starting from kilometer zero, nothing could escape until the end of the first Cat 2 climb more than sixty km into the stage. The General Classification contenders were not going to let any rider who presented even the slightest threat get away.Fourteen riders finally got away: Enrico Barbin and Francesco Bongiorno (Bardiani-CSF,) Francis Mourey (FDJ,) Perrig Quemeneur, Björn Thurau and Romain Sicard (Europcar,) Georg Preidler (Giant-Shimano,) Eduard Vorganov and Daniel Moreno (Katusha,) Philip Deignan (Sky,) Nicolas Roche and Ivan Rovny (Tinkoff-Saxo,) Yonathan Monsalve (Neri Sottoli,) and Moreno Moser (Cannondale.)This group opened a gap of about five minutes, splitting and reforming. As there were no GC contenders in the break, BMC didn’t bother chasing. Instead, Androni Giocattoli, one of the few smaller teams which missed the break, did its best to chase down the escapees.This escape group stayed away and worked together until it hit the day’s final climb, 34 km from the finish, when four riders attacked the break and Trek’s Julian Arredondo attacked the peloton and joined the four 32.8 km from the end, with a 35-second gap.This group added and dropped riders; Arredondo led a quartet of Franco Pellizotti (Androni,) Pierre Rolland (Europcar,) Georg Preidler (Giant-Shimano,) and Alberto Losada (Katusha) over the top of the climb at 28 km, but by 24 km the peloton had swept up everyone ahead on the long descent.Michael Rogers attacked on the descent, 21 km from the line and quickly opened a 500-meter gap on the peloton. This gap stretched to as much as 44 seconds, then shrank steadily. The final 3.5 kilometers of the stage were flat, and the final half-kilometer slightly uphillt, but Rogers had the legs and the will to make up for the first half of his season.BMC’s Cadel Evans remains in the race leader’s pink jersey, with 50 seconds over Omega Pharma-Quickstep’s Rigoberto Uran and 70 seconds on Tinkoff-Saxo’s Rafal Majka.Stage 12 is a 42-km individual time trial, with a Cat 4 climb in the first third and another good lump at the end, and with an uphill finish. Look for the General Classification to get shaken up here.

(AP Photo)By The Associated Press8/8/2021Updated: 8/8/2021PrintBANGKOK—A suspect in the death of a 57-year-old Swiss woman on Thailand’s tourist island of Phuket was charged with murder and robbery, police said Sunday.The suspect, Teerawat Thothip, a 27-year-old Thai man living in Phuket, confessed to the killing and even spoke by telephone at a police press conference to admit his guilt and describe the crime.Investigators were able to trace the suspect using security camera footage, and during the interrogation he was found to have scratches and bruises on his body, said Police Maj. Gen. Nuntadech Yoi-nuan, deputy commissioner of Provincial Police Region 8.Thailand National Police Chief Suwat Jangyodsuk talks to media during a press conference at Provincial Police Region 8 in the southern island of Phuket, Thailand, on Aug. 8, 2021. (Provincial Police Region 8 via AP)The body of the Swiss woman, Nicole Sauvain-Weisskopf, was discovered Thursday at a secluded spot on the island. Swiss media reported she was a member of the country’s diplomatic service.The suspect told reporters he went into a forest on Tuesday to try to find rare plants to sell, but was unsuccessful.On his way back, he said he passed a waterfall and saw Sauvain-Weisskopf. He said he strangled her from behind, and that she resisted for a while before losing consciousness.He then covered her with a black sheet, which was found nearby, took 300 baht ($9) from her backpack and threw her sneakers away. He said his motivation was because he had no money and no work due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The cause of death has not been confirmed, and an autopsy report has yet to be released by the authorities, said Kissana Phathanacharoen, a national police deputy spokesperson.The incident has cast a pall over Thailand’s so-called Phuket Sandbox program to try and bring fully vaccinated foreign tourists to the popular destination, which has been struggling massively during the coronavirus pandemic.

Brad Little speaks as then-Vice President President Mike Pence (L) listens at the White House in Washington, on July 16, 2020. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)By Jack Phillips10/7/2021Updated: 10/7/2021PrintIdaho Gov. Brad Little on Oct. 6 issued an executive order that repealed an order handed down by Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin a day earlier that would have expanded a ban of COVID-19 vaccine passports in the state.McGeachin signed a measure on Oct. 5 that expanded on Little’s previous order banning vaccine passports at state agencies. Her expanded order added public schools and universities, and added a ban on mandatory COVID-19 testing at state agencies.“Today, as Acting Governor, I fixed Gov. Little’s Executive Order on ‘vaccine passports’ to make sure that K-12 schools and universities cannot require vaccinations OR require mandatory testing. I will continue to fight for your individual Liberty!” McGeachin wrote in a Twitter post.In Idaho, when the governor is out of the state even for a brief period of time, the lieutenant governor becomes acting governor.McGeachin, a Republican who is running for governor, had issued the order and sought to activate Idaho’s National Guard and send them to the U.S.–Mexico border amid a surge of illegal immigration. Little, also a Republican, was in Texas this week to meet with other GOP governors to discuss concerns about border security.In a statement, Little said that he hadn’t authorized McGeachin to act and claims that Idaho state law prohibits her from doing so. The state Constitution, however, requires the lieutenant governor to act as governor when the chief executive leaves the state.“I am in Texas performing my duties as the duly-elected governor of Idaho, and I have not authorized the Lt. Governor to act on my behalf,” he said in a statement.Idaho Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin speaks during a mask-burning event at the Idaho Statehouse in Boise, Idaho, on March 6, 2021. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images)The governor’s temporary presence in “Texas on official business” does not “impair my ability to represent the people of Idaho thus necessitating action by another executive to ensure the continuity of state government,” Little’s executive order said (pdf), which noted that he had previously banned state governments from requiring vaccine passports earlier this year.The order argued that those who authored Idaho’s state Constitution “did not permit, nor would they now sanction, a lieutenant governor’s actions to subvert or supplant the policies of an otherwise capable, qualified, and duly elected governor.”Idaho House Speaker Scott Bedke, a Republican, criticized McGeachin, who is running on the campaign slogan “Make Idaho Free Again,” and asserted that she was abusing her office to try to drum up election support.McGeachin’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request by The Epoch Times for comment.

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)By The Canadian Press11/13/2020Updated: 11/13/2020PrintOTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will continue today to prod premiers towards more stringent measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, even as he offers up more federal funding to help provinces retrain workers left jobless by the pandemic.Trudeau is expected to announce hundreds of millions of dollars more for provinces to plow into skills training, on top of some $3.5 billion in previously announced funding.But he’s also expected to renew his call for premiers to impose the restrictions necessary to douse the wildfire spread of COVID-19 and not be deterred by the economic costs of shutting down businesses.Trudeau took that message directly to premiers during a conference call Thursday evening.A summary of the call issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, says Trudeau asked premiers to “identify their specific needs to protect the health and safety of Canadians and bring the virus under control in their jurisdictions.”And he assured them the federal government will continue to provide them with assistance and “will do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to keep Canadians safe and supported.”Federal officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the issue publicly, say Trudeau stressed that he’s not trying to tell premiers what to do or cast blame for the alarming surge in COVID-19 cases across the country.Rather, he wanted to emphasize that the federal government has put in place billions worth of support programs to help individuals and businesses weather lockdowns—and stands ready to pour more money into the effort to get the second wave under control.Trudeau issued a similar message Tuesday.“With rising cases of COVID-19 here at home, there’s added pressure on all orders of government to keep people safe, and to protect jobs,” he told a news conference.“But I would hope that no leader in our country is easing public health vigilance because they feel pressure not to shut down businesses or slow down our economy.“... I’m imploring the premiers and our mayors to please do the right thing: Act now to protect public health. If you think something is missing in the support we’re offering for your citizens, tell us.”That message did not sit well with all premiers. Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe said it was “extremely unhelpful” for the prime minister to frame the issue as a “false choice” between protecting Canadians’ health and protecting the economy.Still, officials said Thursday’s conference call was collegial and constructive. The readout added that “all first ministers reiterated their support for the Team Canada approach to fighting COVID-19.” Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowThe Canadian PressAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesRCMP Form National Co-ordination Team in Response to Extortion SchemesFeb 15, 2024RCMP Use of Private-Sector Surveillance Services Worries Federal Privacy WatchdogFeb 15, 2024Prime Minister and Manitoba Premier Announce $633M in Health FundingFeb 15, 2024Some Members of Parliament, Ministers Assigned Police Protection as Security TightensFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsCOVID-19CommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

Current indications of LVADs include Bridge to Transplantation (BTT), Destination Therapy (DT) for long-term use, Bridge to the Decision (BTD) used as a temporary measure, and lastly Bridge to Recovery (BTR). Here, we briefly review the clinical evidence and the molecular mechanisms behind myocardial recovery following LVAD placement. We also share institutional protocols used at 2 major medical centers in the USA.IntroductionCardiac myocyte injury may occur due to ischemia and necrosis from limited oxygen supply leading to the loss of cardiac function. The hallmark is ventricular remodeling following an insult resulting from loss of myocytes, myocyte hypertrophy, and alterations in contractile properties of myocytes secondary to β-adrenoceptor downregulation and alteration in calcium homeostasis.1 In addition, following myocardial injury, the myocytes also experience mitochondrial abnormalities, a disarray of the cytoskeleton cell death (apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy), and extracellular matrix alterations.2 Off-loading myocardium via an LVAD provides a unique opportunity to reverse these changes.Clinical RecoveryThe benefits offered by LVADs when used as Bridge to Recovery therapy have been well documented in an array of clinical experiments. Several studies have shown that LVADs use results in the successful recovery of myocardium. In the study by Mancini et al,3 19 patients who had LVADs implanted while waiting for transplantation for dilated cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease, 5 (26%) patients eventually had the devices explanted after 3 months of use, indicating the potential for myocardial recovery in patients with end-stage heart failure. MacGowan et al4 also suggested improved functionality of the myocardium when 8 out of 9 patients with prolonged HeartMate II LVADs underwent explantation after a mean duration of 766 ± 343 days.In the RESTAGE-HF (Remission from Stage D Heart Failure) trial, 40% of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who received an aggressive pharmacological regimen and implantation of HeartMate II LVADs eventually underwent explanation of the devices within 18 months. This demonstrates that physical unloading of left ventricles promotes reverse remodeling leading to myocardial recovery by LVADs. The reverse remodeling by LVADs was found to be more optimized with the use of aggressive pharmacological treatment and regular cardiac monitoring.5Several studies aimed to determine the survival rate once the LVAD was decommissioned. In a retrospective review of 515 LVADs patients, Gerhard et al6 reported that out of 515 patients who received LVADs support, 29 (5%) patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy showed evidence of myocardial recovery, and 17 (3%) of these patients eventually underwent LVAD explanation. At 73 days after decommissioning, only one patient (6%) developed recurrent heart failure, indicating a long-term device-free survival rate of 94% at the end of 1 year.6Monteagudo Vela et al7 highlighted the reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction achieved by LVADs can be long-term by examining the device-free survival rate at 6 years in patients who underwent explanation after receiving LVADs support for a median of 317 days. In their study, of 470 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy with LVADs, 52 (11%) patients underwent explantation. Of these 52 patients, 26 patients with HeartMate II or HeartWare HVAD experienced a long-term device-free survival rate of 87.9% at 1 year, and their survival rate at 6 years only minimally decreased to 77.8%. In addition, the follow-up examination showed an average ejection fraction of 44.25 ± 8.44%, while LVESD and LVEDD were found to be 4.54 ± 0.68 and 5.8 ± 0.46 cm in post-explantation patients at 1 year.7Pan et al8 reviewed 594 patients of HeartMate II and HeartWare HVADs who received LVAD support for a total duration of 500.4 days. Of these, 34 (5%) patients underwent explantation of the devices after experiencing myocardial recovery. The study also identified several positive predictors of myocardial recovery- young age, female sex, low body mass index, and non-ischemic cause of heart failure, highlighting greater benefits of LVADs support when used in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.8Analysis from the INTERMACS registry that contains data on commercially approved LVADs implanted in the United States, 1 in 10 LVAD patients experienced either complete or partial myocardial remission with aggressive assessment and frequent weaning evaluations.9Boehmer et al10 analyzed the cohort of subjects in the Intervention in Myocarditis and Acute Cardiomyopathy 2 (IMAC2). Of 373 patients, 14 (3.8%) were identified to be on LVADs support for nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Although the study showed the presence of myocardial inflammation in BTR cohort, lack of fibrosis with lower LV2EDD were favorable predictors of recovery. Out of 14 patients with LVADs, 8 (57%) experienced either complete or partial myocardial injury, and 7 (87.5%) out of those 8 were device free at 19 months of follow-up.10Table 1 summarizes favorable characteristics for LVAD explantation.Table 1.

In addition, reduced fibrosis with less severe alterations in myocardial structure is seen in patients who had LVAD weaned off.13Abnormal calcium (Ca2+) handling related to cardiac injury is also associated with decreased contractility. In patients with congestive heart failure, this is evidenced by the depletion of internal Ca2+ stores and impaired function of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPASe (SERCA2a). Heerdt et al14 showed the reverse remodeling of cardiac myocytes supported by LVAD by upregulation of SERCA2a gene expression. LVADs reverse adrenergic remodeling induction in β-adrenergic receptor activity with increased contractile properties of the myocardium.15The role of apoptosis in both acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure has been studied and demonstrated in the literature. Apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells is known to be a process leading to the progression of heart failure.16 LVADs result in a fivefold increase in HSP72, an important antiapoptotic factor that prevents cell death.17 Manginas et al18 noted an increased number of circulating CD34+ progenitor cells as well as decreased BNP levels in patients with LVADs.In congestive heart failure, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) are increased which results in further activation of the renin-angiotensin system leading to cachexia and anemia.19 In their study, Torre-Amione et al20 showed a reduction of TNF in patients on LVADs. The suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) is a member of the interleukin family, and the soluble form of ST2 is known to affect cardiac fibrosis.21 Tseng et al22 showed a significant reduction of sST2, with normalization of levels 3 months after LVAD placement, indicating a reduction in fibrosis.LVADs also result in the upregulation of genes encoding both sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric proteins.23 Cardiolipin is a mitochondrial inner protein that is involved in the maintenance of integrity and regulation of the electron transport chain. Post LVAD placement, Heerdt et al24 demonstrated normalization of cardiolipin composition in ischemic cardiomyopathy, in the setting of reduced mitochondrial stress.The association between congestive heart failure and the overactivation of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) has been well-documented for over a decade. Welp et al25 showed plasma renin and aldosterone levels fell close to normal in both pulsatile and non-pulsatile LVADs, however, the effect was more pronounced in pulsatile LVADs. Inhibition of the RAAS pathway with ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with LVADs has been shown to limit myocardial remodeling, reduce arterio-venous malformations, and improve overall survival.26Explantation Protocol at Tertiary US CentersThe RESTAGE-HF trial has represented a major turning point in the pursuit of LVAD explantation through the development of a standardized protocol. This protocol has now become standard practice for many institutions including the University of Washington (UW). The institutional protocol at UW is one that essentially mirrors the protocol designed by the RESTAGE-HF trial.27Per this protocol, patients undergo aggressive pharmacologic management based on the HEAAL study.28 These include ACE-inhibitor or ARB, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists, with close follow-up of renal function, electrolyte management, as well as targeted mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >60 mmHg. An initial clinical assessment is then conducted which includes baseline echocardiography and right heart catheterization. Patients are then followed serially at 6 weeks, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, and 18 months with repeat blood tests and echocardiography.27For the assessment of explantation, the functional status of the patient as well as objective parameters gathered from echocardiography and invasive hemodynamic testing are used collectively to determine whether a patient is stable for an explantation attempt. These criteria, as outlined in the RESTAGE-HF trial include the following:1.LVEDD < 60 mm, LVESD < 50 mm, LVEF > 45%2.PAWP ⩽ 15 mmHg3.Resting cardiac index (CI) > 2.4L/min/m24.Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) with exercise >16 mL/kg/min[LVEDD, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter; LVESD, left ventricular end-systolic diameter; PAWP, pulmonary artery wedge pressure].The institutional protocol implemented by Maine Medical Center (Figure 1) assesses similar parameters for patients who have shown promising signs of myocardial recovery that are considered for weaning off the LVAD support. Five patients since 2014 have successfully been explanted following the outlined protocol. Patients must be on optimal guideline-directed heart failure (HF) medical therapy adopted by the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines for the management of chronic heart failure. After the pharmacological regimen, patients undergo an echocardiogram on a 3 months basis, and those who meet the following criteria such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >45%, normal right ventricular (RV) function, absence of significant valvular disease, and significant and sustained reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension(LVEDD) as compared to pre-implantation function, LVEDD < 55 mm, LVESD < 48 mm, are followed through the explanation protocol and scheduled for ramp echocardiogram to optimize the LVAD speed. Once on the ramp echocardiogram, patients are further monitored to demonstrate clinical stability and continued myocardial recovery by tolerating exercise tolerance at decreased speed of the LVAD device. The devices are set to decrease the speed every 5 minutes by 100 RPM(HVAD)/400 RPM(HM2)/200 RPM(HM3) RPM to a no-net flow speed of 2000 RPM (HVAD)/6000 RPM (HM2)/4000 RPM(HM3) in 15 minute duration. After this trial, they are then assessed for LVEF, LVEDD, and LVESD, quantity of valve regurgitation, and aortic valve opening and a right heart catheterization is performed, to lead to the final decision to explant the LVAD device.Figure 1. Flow diagram shows LVAD wean to explant protocol by marine medical center.ConclusionFor more than a decade, the benefit of cardiac myocyte reverse remodeling that occurs by the utility of LVADs was limited to the remission state. However, several recent experimental studies have demonstrated the possibility of long-term recovery rather than temporary remission in patients with severe advanced heart failure after implantation of LVADs in addition to pharmacological therapy. It is important to continue the investigation of LVADs role in myocardial recovery, as LVADs have revolutionized outcomes of advanced heart failure patients as limited numbers of hearts are available for transplant.Declaration of Conflicting Interests:The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.Funding:The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.ORCID iDsSamiullah Arshad https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0749-0367Rachel D.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images) By The Associated Press7/16/2015Updated: 7/16/2015PrintNEW YORK—Citigroup’s profits rebounded in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, when the bank recorded a huge legal settlement with regulators.The bank said Thursday that it earned $4.57 billion after payments to preferred shareholders as the bank cut expenses across the board, sharply higher than the $102 million it earned a year earlier.Citi’s second-quarter profits were basically erased last year after the bank recorded $3.8 billion in costs related to settling charges over its role in the housing bubble and subsequent financial crisis.On a per-share basis, Citi earned $1.51, compared with 3 cents a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were $1.45 a share, due to a six-cent accounting adjustment tied to value of Citi’s debt holdings, but that still beat the $1.35 per share that financial analysts were expecting.Citi’s global consumer banking division, which includes Citi’s U.S. retail banking chain, credit cards, as well as its consumer banking business in Latin America and Asia, had net income of $1.63 billion. That’s up 4 percent from a year ago, helped by a drop in expenses.Like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, Citi has been looking to cut expenses in its consumer banking division through branch closures, layoffs and other measures. The bank had 15 percent fewer branches than it did a year ago, Citi said.Citi saw a drop in trading revenue compared to the first quarter, in line with other major banks, as financial markets became less volatile. Fixed income, currency and commodity trading revenue declined 12 percent from the first quarter to $3.06 billion, while stock trading revenue fell 25 percent.Citi Holdings, the bank’s so-called “bad bank” that holds the bad mortgages and other toxic securities left over from the financial crisis, made a modest profit in the quarter of $157 million compared with the $3.4 billion loss the business had a year ago.Citi has been winding down and selling off assets in Citi Holdings for several years. Since last year, the division has been making small profits each quarter. Assets in Citi Holdings were $116 billion, down 22 percent from a year earlier.Under CEO Michael Corbat, Citi has been trying to become a slimmer, more efficient company and so far, the strategy is working. The bank passed the Federal Reserve’s so-called stress test earlier this year, after failing in 2014. Citi was able to raise its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share in March, the bank’s first increase since the 2008 financial crisis.Net revenue at the bank totaled $19.47 billion, compared with $19.43 billion in the same period a year earlier.Citigroup’s stock rose $1.52, or 2.7 percent, to $57.99 in early morning trading.

(AAP Image/Lukas Coch) By Lis Wang5/28/2023Updated: 5/28/2023PrintThe Western Australia (WA) government announced rental reforms that will help balance the needs between renters and landlords as the state is the last jurisdiction in Australia where renters can be evicted with no-grounds.WA Commerce Minister, Sue Ellery, introduced rental reforms on May 26 that will improve the rights for renters and provide certainty for landlords.The modernised tenancy law will reduce the frequency of rent increases and will only be allowed to increase once every 12 months—rent increases can currently occur every six months. The practise of rent bidding will also be prohibited.The proposed ban on rent bidding will mean landlords and property managers won’t be able to pressure or ask applicants to offer a higher price than the advertised rent to secure the property.Advertised rent prices will also need to be a fixed amount rather than a range.Under the proposed changes, renters in WA will be allowed to have a pet or pets in most cases, and they will also be able to make certain minor modifications to the property.WA tenants will not have to choose between a rental property and/or their pets, but landlords are able to add conditions to keeping a pet.Landlords will only be able to refuse a tenant to keep a pet or pets on “reasonable grounds” with the consent from the Commissioner for Consumer Protection.Certain minor modifications to the rental property can be made by tenants, with the landlord only able to refuse consent on certain grounds. Minor modifications such as painting walls and installing hooks are examples of certain minor modifications tenants will be able to make without permission from the landlord.Any minor modifications made by the tenant to the rental property may need to be restored to their original condition at the end of the tenancy.The release of security bonds and the end of tenancy will be streamlined in the proposed changes, which will allow tenants and landlords to apply separately for how the bond payments are to be disbursed.Any disputes over bonds or disagreements over pets and minor modifications are to be referred to the Commissioner for Consumer Protection to handle and decide.“It’s no secret that some tenants in Western Australia are doing it tough at the moment, facing a combination of low vacancy rates and rising rents. Prohibiting rent bidding and reducing rent increases to once a year will help ease the financial burden on many families,” Ellery said.Reforms in Housing Supply ShortageThe WA government has not made any changes to the “no-grounds” evictions in the Act, as landlords can currently terminate a fixed-term tenancy without a reason with 30 days’ notice, or 60 days’ notice for ongoing periodic leases.“As part of the 2023-24 State Budget, we’ve committed an additional $750 million (US$490 million) in housing, homelessness, and lands initiatives, which include 100 percent stamp duty concessions, a range of changes to Keystart loans, and $47.6 million (US$31 million) to expand WA’s housing construction workforce to bolster the supply of housing across our state,” said Housing Minister John Carey in the media release.Real Estate Institute of Western Australia (REIWA) CEO Cath Hart welcomed the rental reforms and said while the “recent State Budget initiatives focused on supply, we also need a legislative environment that sustains and encourages investment.”“Investors make up about 85 percent of the private rental market—and the majority of investors only have one property. Unfortunately, they have been leaving the market in significant numbers, so there are nearly 20,000 fewer rental properties now than two years ago,” Hart said in a media release.“Over the course of the review of the Residential Tenancies Act, REIWA’s aim has been to make renting possible, and the reality is that it’s not possible without investors. If investors aren’t confident about property, they will put their money into other assets, and rental queues will remain long.“The reforms announced today strike the right balance for owners and tenants. The next step will be to work through the detail of these measures, and we will continue to advocate for practical and pragmatic approaches to their implementation.”Hart said the rental reforms recognised the need for legislation to create an environment that encourages investment while balancing the needs of tenants.Western Australia’s Rental MarketREIWA reported that Perth currently has the nation’s lowest rental vacancy rate at only 0.7 percent in April, compared to 2.5 to 3.5 percent, which indicates a balanced market.Perth’s rental vacancy rate in April 2022 was 1.2 percent, up from 1 percent the year prior.“Our housing is more affordable than other states, and our tenants tend to spend a shorter time in the rental market before moving onto home ownership,” said Hart.“Perth’s property market remains the most affordable in the country, yet it’s poised for continued growth,” said Johnson, Summit Developments’ senior development consultant, in a release by realestate.com.au.Rental Reforms in Other StatesEarlier this month, the New South Wales (NSW) government also introduced a rental reform proposal. On May 10, the Labor government introduced a bill that would commit to providing cost-of-living relief and better protection to NSW renters.The bill also looked to close the loopholes in the existing ban on solicited rent bidding to include landlords and third parties, and create a portable bond scheme to reduce strain on renters. A ban on secret rent bidding will also be implemented by requiring landlords and agents to notify applicants of other offers from other prospective tenants that are higher than the advertised price.The NSW government is also looking to end ‘no-grounds’ evictions, make it easier to have pets, and better protect renters’ personal information.“This is a sensible cost of living measure to help ease the pressure on the over 30 percent of people in New South Wales currently renting,” said NSW Premier Chris Minns in the media release.“These changes will create a fairer rental regime in this state by providing greater certainty as well as flexibility for both renters and owners.” Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowLis WangAuthor FollowLis Wang is an Australia based reporter covering a range of topics including health, culture, and social issues.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

There is no agreement to release these four Americans.”Klain was asked whether he believes the Iranian state television report was a deliberate pressure ploy in negotiations.“Sometimes in these kind of things, the other country will rush to the microphones to force your hand. Do you feel that?” asked CBS journalist John Dickerson.“No,” Klain replied, adding, “again, we’re working hard to bring these Americans home when we get that done we will obviously be delighted to announce that news.”Iranian state media on Monday cited Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh as denying the prisoner swap.The report further cited Khatibzadeh as insisting that Iran and the UK were not engaged in legal talks to free Iranian-British national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Sunday’s report by Iranian state television—the same one that cited anonymous sources about the claimed U.S.-Iran prisoner deal—said Zaghari-Ratcliffe would be released once Britain had paid off a debt on military equipment owed to Tehran.Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation charity, was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 and later convicted of plotting to overthrow its regime, charges she denies.Iran and world powers are holding talks to revive the 2015 nuclear accord that President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of three years ago. Trump believed that the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—known commonly as the Iran nuclear deal—was not decisive enough in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Besides pulling out of the deal in 2018, Trump restored and augmented sanctions to try to force Iran into renegotiating the pact with more concessions.This satellite photo by Maxar Technologies shows construction at Iran's Fordo nuclear facility on Dec. 11, 2020. (Maxar Technologies via AP)Trump argued that the Obama-era deal failed to address Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East and the development of its ballistic missile program.“We cannot prevent an Iranian bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement,” Trump said in 2018.After Trump pulled out of the deal, Iran violated some of the pact’s nuclear restrictions.President Joe Biden came into office saying that getting back into the accord was a priority. But Iran and the United States have disagreed over Iran’s demands that sanctions be lifted first, and the stalemate threatened to become an early foreign policy setback for the Biden administration.Tehran and the powers have been meeting in Vienna since early April to work on steps that must be taken to bring Washington and Tehran back into deal, touching on U.S. sanctions and Iran’s breaches of the 2015 pact.Iran says that, under the U.S. sanctions imposed in 2018, some $20 billion of its oil revenue has been frozen in a number of countries.Iran’s top negotiator in Vienna, Abbas Araghchi, pressed Teheran’s position that all sanctions be removed, according to Iran’s official news agency.“Our red line is that all sanctions reimposed and those imposed under different labels must be lifted,” Araghchi said.Jake Sullivan, U.S. national security adviser, said on Sunday that no deal had been reached with Iran in Vienna.“There is still a fair distance to travel to close the remaining gaps,” he said on ABC’s “This Week” program. “And those gaps are over what sanctions the United States and other countries will roll back. They are over what nuclear restrictions Iran will accept on its program to ensure that they can never get a nuclear weapon.”Sullivan added that U.S. diplomats would continue negotiating over the coming weeks “to try to arrive at a mutual return to the JCPOA, which is the Iran nuclear deal on a compliance-for-compliance basis.” Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowTom OzimekAuthor (Reporter)FollowTom Ozimek is a senior reporter for The Epoch Times.

We re-evaluated the previously described PROTECT (PRoximal balloon Occlusion TogEther with direCt Thrombus aspiration during stent retriever thrombectomy) Plus technique at a tertiary comprehensive stroke center.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy with stentrievers between May 2011 and April 2020. Patients were divided between those who underwent PROTECT Plus and those who did not (proximal balloon occlusion with stent retriever only). We compared the groups in terms of reperfusion, groin to reperfusion time, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at discharge.ResultsWithin the study period, 167 (71.4%) PROTECT Plus and 67 (28.6%) non-PROTECT patients which met our inclusion criteria. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients with successful reperfusion (mTICI >2b) between the techniques (85.0% vs 82.1%; p = 0.58). The PROTECT Plus group had lower rates of mRS ≤2 at discharge (40.1% vs 57.6%; p = 0.016). The rate of sICH was comparable (p = 0.35) between the PROTECT Plus group (7.2%) and the non-PROTECT group (3.0%).ConclusionThe PROTECT Plus technique using a BGC, a distal reperfusion catheter and stent retriever is feasible for recanalization of large vessel occlusions. Successful recanalization, first-pass recanalization and complication rates are similar between PROTECT Plus and non-PROTECT stent retriever techniques. This study adds to an existing body of literature detailing techniques that use both a stent retriever and a distal reperfusion catheter to maximize recanalization for patients with large vessel occlusions.IntroductionStroke is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide.1 The advent of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) heralded a new age in the treatment of large vessel ischemic stroke. With a pooled number needed to treat of 2.6,2 large randomized controlled trials that utilized stent retrievers (SR) have shown indubitable benefit in functional outcomes for patients in the intervention arm compared to those who only received best medical management.3,4,5,6,7 Results of the DAWN trial have expanded the treatment window to 24 hours for patients with radiologic evidence of salvageable brain tissue—more than four times the 4.5-hour golden period required for medical reperfusion with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.8 The efficacy of contact aspiration (CA) for large vessel occlusion (LVO) has also recently been shown to be non-inferior to stent retrievers in terms of both clinical and radiologic outcomes.9The process of EVT for stroke is not without complications. As the SR with an embedded clot is navigated into a proximal catheter there is a risk of thrombus fragmentation especially for long thrombi.10 These small breakaway clots can cause persistent main trunk occlusion, distal territory emboli or even new territory emboli.6,11 To circumvent this phenomenon, the use of adjunct devices and the combined use of reperfusion devices have been utilized. The use of a balloon guide catheter (BGC) to arrest flow in the internal carotid artery (ICA) during clot retrieval has been associated with superior recanalization rates and clinical outcomes.12 Various techniques utilizing both CA devices and SRs have been published with the basic principle of using aspiration devices for additional flow control and clot suction during retrieval with a stent.13-16 Apart from improving radiologic outcomes, some of these maneuvers have also shown faster or equivalent time to recanalization compared to conventional stent retrieval or aspiration.14,17Our center has incorporated the use of a BGC, aspiration catheter, and SR to improve the outcomes of EVT. The previously described PROTECT Plus (PRoximal balloon Occlusion TogEther with direCt Thrombus aspiration during stent retriever thrombectomy) technique,18,19 incorporates a step that involves advancing the reperfusion catheter over the deployed proximal SR wire adjacent to the beginning of the clot until the pump drip rate slows. This step ensures a tight seal between the aspiration catheter and the clot just before the whole system is pulled down with the SR under flow arrest. We believe that this technique can minimize distal emboli from clot fragmentation and improve reperfusion. A similar technique, the Aspiration Retriever Technique for Stroke (ARTS) also uses a BGC, aspiration catheter and SR, but does not emphasize the crucial step we outlined above.13The aim of our study is to detail a strategy for mechanical reperfusion that may be used as a first-line or rescue maneuver when SRs or aspiration catheters used independently fail to attain reperfusion. Furthermore, we seek to compare radiologic reperfusion outcomes and time to reperfusion of PROTECT to the conventional SR method (non-PROTECT) and to validate this previously described technique.MethodsPatient selection and study designA retrospective review of all patients undergoing EVT for LVOs at a comprehensive stroke center from May 2011 to April 2020 was undertaken. Baseline characteristics, which included both clinical and angiographic parameters, were collected. A board-certified neurologist determined the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score while fully trained interventional neuroradiologists ascertained all radiologic parameters. Inclusion criteria were: age ≥18 years, procedure done with the use of BGC and SR, start of EVT within 24 hours from last known well time, and occlusion involving the intracranial ICA and middle cerebral artery (MCA; M1 and proximal M2 segments). EVT for distal territories (M2 and beyond), ACA and PCA, and those that did not utilize BGC were excluded from the study. All those who met the inclusion criteria were divided between the PROTECT Plus and non-PROTECT. Those in the PROTECT Plus group utilized a BGC, SR, and CA while those in the non-PROTECT group used only a BGC and SR (Figure 1). These two groups were then compared according to their baseline characteristics and predetermined outcomes of the study.Figure 1. The PROTECT Plus technique. (A) The tip of the balloon guide catheter (BGC) (arrow) is positioned in the proximal internal carotid artery. (B) The reperfusion catheter (arrow) is positioned close to but not to the face of the clot. (C) The microcatheter and microwire cross the clot (arrow). (D) The microwire is removed and a stent retriever (arrow) is deployed into the clot. After waiting for a few minutes, the reperfusion catheter is slowly advanced under suction until arrest of flow at the pump confirms that it is at the face of the clot. The BGC is inflated (arrowhead) while stent retriever and the reperfusion catheter are slowly pulled out of the system. Throughout the pull, we take special care to ensure that the stent retriever is not pulled fully into the reperfusion catheter. The BGC is deflated and we perform an angiographic run to determine if the pull was successful.The primary outcome of the study was the final radiologic outcome after EVT. This was judged based on the modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale.20 Reperfusion with TICI ≥ 2B was considered a successful outcome. First pass successful reperfusion rate, total procedural time, post-EVT symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate (sICH), discharge outcomes, in-hospital mortality rate, and procedural complication rate were analyzed as secondary outcomes. Favorable discharge outcomes were defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of ≤2. Total procedural time was based on the groin puncture to final reperfusion time. We used the original National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) definition of sICH which classifies all patients with any clinical deterioration associated with any hemorrhage on plain cranial CT as sICH.21 Procedural complications included: groin complications, intracranial and extracranial vascular damage, and stent-related complications.Routine procedural technique: Protect plusArterial femoral access is obtained through a 9 French 80 cm Arrow sheath (Teleflex, Morrisville, North Carolina, USA) or regular short femoral sheath (9 French by 11 cm). A 9 French 92 cm Cello BGC (Medtronic, Irvine, California, USA) or an 8 French 85 cm Flowgate BGC (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA) is then navigated to the appropriate ICA over a 180 cm Advantage Glidewire (Terumo, Somerset, New Jersey). After placing the BGC into the proximal ICA, the Advantage Glidewire is removed. An ACE 68 distal aspiration catheter (Penumbra, Alameda, California, USA) is then brought up into the ICA over a Fathom 14 microwire (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts, USA) and Velocity microcatheter (Penumbra, Alameda, California, USA). Next, both microcatheter and microwire are navigated across the occlusion in the carotid terminus or M1 segment of the MCA. At that point, a gentle injection is done through the microcatheter to confirm that the system is indeed past the occlusion.The microwire is then removed and replaced with an SR device: Trevo (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA) or Solitaire (Medtronic, Irvine, California, USA). The stent is then deployed over the occlusion and allowed to sit for 3–7 minutes. The microcatheter is then pulled out of the system. Afterwards, the distal aspiration catheter, connected to a continuous aspiration pump, is advanced towards the clot until complete flow arrest or minimal drip is seen on the pump, signifying direct contact of the catheter with the clot. Finally, the balloon is inflated for flow arrest and the whole system, including the distal aspiration catheter (still connected to a continuous pump system) with the SR in tow, is slowly pulled under flow arrest from the inflated balloon. A routine angiogram is then done to check for adequacy of reperfusion. The procedure is repeated if reperfusion (TICI ≥ 2B) is not achieved.Statistical analysisData analysis was performed using SPSS version 26 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA). Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or number (percentage). For skewed variables, data are presented as median (interquartile range). Independent t tests were used to analyze continuous variables, while Chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests were used to analyze categorical variables. Skewed data were analyzed after natural log transformation.Logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to determine the effect of the PROTECT Plus on patient outcomes. In logistic regression, data are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Also, we further adjusted for potential confounding factors in multivariable regression models, including history of coronary artery disease, prior antiplatelets use, Alberta stroke program early CT score (ASPECTS), ICA occlusion and tandem occlusion. A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Ethics approvalThe study was approved by our institutional research ethics board (18–397). The retrospective nature of the study precluded informed consent from the patients.ResultsBaseline clinical characteristics and procedural detailsWithin the study period, a total of 334 patients were brought to the angiosuite for EVT. Of these, only 234 (70%) met our inclusion criteria (see Supplemental Figure 1). PROTECT Plus was performed in 167 patients (71.4%). The non-PROTECT arm had 67 patients (28.6%).Mean age at treatment was 67.3 ± 13.8 years (ranged from 31 to 95) and 51.7% were male. The mean NIHSS score on presentation was 14.7 ± 5.9. Baseline clinical characteristics and procedural details are summarized in Table 1. History of coronary artery disease (p = 0.027), lower ASPECTS (p = 0.003), ICA occlusion (p = 0.016), and tandem occlusion (p = 0.012) were all significantly higher in the PROTECT Plus group. While prior antiplatelet therapy use (p = 0.024) was higher in the non-PROTECT group. There were no other statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics, cerebrovascular risk factors and procedural factors between the two groups. Despite the need for another step in the PROTECT Plus with the use of CA, there was no significant increase in the groin to reperfusion time compared to non-PROTECT: 55.0 min (interquartile range: 40.0–79.0) vs. 49.5 min (interquartile range: 28.5–85.3) (p = 0.34).Table 1.

There was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients with successful reperfusion (mTICI ≥ 2b) between the PROTECT Plus and non-PROTECT groups (85.0% vs 82.1%; p = 0.58). The PROTECT Plus group had lower rates of mRS ≤2 at discharge (40.1% vs 57.6%; p = 0.016) (Table 2). Further supporting these associations, multivariable logistic regression showed that the PROTECT Plus group had 0.48 times (95% CI: 0.26–0.90, p = 0.023) lower odds of having mRS ≤2 at discharge, after adjusting for identified confounders.Table 2.

There were no reported events of vessel rupture. There was an overall 12.0% mortality rate at discharge, and no vessel rupture or stent-related events. Although the PROTECT Plus group had a lower rate of sICH (9.7%) compared to the non-PROTECT group (10.4%) using NINDS definition, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.86). Likewise, the rate of sICH was comparable between the PROTECT Plus group (7.2%) and the non-PROTECT group (3.0%) using the Safe Implementation of Treatment in Stroke definition (p = 0.35).DiscussionIn contrast to previously published data, our results suggest that the PROTECT Plus is similar to non-PROTECT with respect to successful recanalization.18,19 However, compared to the HERMES collaboration, which pooled data from the initial landmark EVT trials, PROTECT Plus resulted in a higher overall recanalization rate (83.3% vs. 71%). Despite having an additional device in play, the reperfusion catheter, PROTECT Plus did not result in a significant increase in overall complication rate and groin to reperfusion time.Several techniques utilizing supplementary devices in addition to stent retrievers have been previously described. These have been summarized in Table 3. The requirement of a BGC sets the PROTECT Plus apart from other techniques. A systematic review done on the use of BGCs showed superior recanalization rates and clinical outcomes with the addition of this device.12 All of the overall recanalization rates of the techniques described are higher than that of the landmark EVT trials (>71%). The recent COMPASS trial solidified the position of aspiration thrombectomy as non-inferior to SRs.9 All the techniques reviewed including PROTECT Plus also had higher overall reperfusion rates (> 76%) compared to the COMPASS aspiration arm.Table 3.

Several possibilities may account for this result. First, the bulk of non-PROTECT procedures were done in earlier time periods even before EVT was considered standard of care in 2015. PROTECT Plus accounted for 7.5% of patients from 2011–2015 and 90.1% of patients from 2016–2020. (See Supplemental Table 1) Thus, a selection bias may be at play. The neurointerventionalists of our center were likely taking on harder cases using PROTECT Plus in the later cases (2016–2020). This is evidenced by the higher proportions of the more technically demanding tandem occlusions found in the PROTECT Plus group. However, it is worth noting that despite having more tandem occlusions in the PROTECT Plus arm, there was no significant difference in the overall rate reperfusion, rate of first pass TICI 3 and groin to reperfusion time. It is also possible that the operators were choosing PROTECT Plus for more challenging lesions because the technique intuitively should be more effective at recanalization. Second, both groups utilized a BGC. It would be interesting to do a comparison between the PROTECT Plus and a standard EVT group that includes even those that do not use a BGC. The lower rate of discharge mRS ≤2 in the PROTECT Plus group may be accounted for the statistically significant higher rate of coronary artery disease and lower ASPECTS found in this group.The results of the ASTER 2 trial, which randomized patients into a BGC with combined SR and CA arm, and a BGC with SR arm only, show that the combined arm did not result in a statistically significant increase (64.5% vs 57.9%; p = 0.17) in near complete to complete reperfusion (mTICI 2c/3) or in successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b/2c/3; 90.2 vs 85.6%; p = 0.13).22 These results are consistent with the findings of our study that show no statistically significant difference for this outcome. PROTECT Plus may also have a role in salvage EVT for those who fail first-pass CA. A recent series found that a second or third pass combined SR and CA for those who fail first pass CA resulted in superior recanalization rates compared to performing CA repeatedly. They also suggest that clots in the ICA region may benefit from an initial combined CA and SR approach.23 While we are enabled aspiration only at the moment before engagement, others have reported a successful version of this technique where aspiration is enabled for the entire intracranial catheter navigation.24This study has several limitations. First is the aforementioned selection bias because of the retrospective nature of the study. The higher rate of tandem occlusions, and coronary artery disease and the lower ASPECTS in the PROTECT Plus population are likely to have significantly affected our radiologic and clinical outcomes. Second, the great majority of the non-PROTECT patients were treated in earlier years while those from the PROTECT Plus group were treated later as the technique became favored. An institutional learning curve may be responsible for the trend of lower recanalization rate in the traditional group rather than a true benefit of PROTECT PLUS. Furthermore, we are a training institution with senior fellows frequently taking the lead in stroke cases. The PROTECT Plus technique has a steeper learning curve which may have resulted in the finding of no statistical significance between the two techniques. Lastly, we utilized discharge mRS as 90-day mRS was not consistently available. We eagerly await the publication of the ASTER 2 trial. More studies geared towards identifying situations (salvage maneuver, occlusion morphology, and stroke etiology) where PROTECT Plus may result in superior recanalization rate should be done.ConclusionsThe PROTECT Plus technique using a BGC, distal reperfusion catheter, and SR is a feasible technique for recanalization of LVOs but our study does not demonstrate superiority of the technique over conventional mechanical thrombectomy. Successful recanalization, first-pass recanalization, and complication rates were similar in both groups despite a greater proportion of tandem occlusions in the PROTECT Plus group. This study adds to an existing body of literature detailing techniques that use both a SR and distal reperfusion catheter to maximize recanalization for patients with LVOs.Ethical approvalThe study was performed in compliance with the World Medical association’s Declaration of Helsinki.

Staab/AFP via Getty Images)By Zachary Stieber9/7/2020Updated: 9/7/2020PrintPolice officers in Pittsburgh are investigating videos that show violence during demonstrations that took place over the weekend, a police official confirmed to The Epoch Times on Sept. 7.One video shows a demonstrator shoving a megaphone into the face of another man, who was holding a bicycle. The man holding the bike swatted the megaphone. Then another demonstrator smacked the man in the head with a skateboard.Another clip shows the man with the megaphone using it to shout at people dining at outdoor tables at a restaurant.“You are an embarrassment,” the man shouted as other people in the crowd jeered.Another man went up to two diners and told them, “[Expletive] the white people that built” something, before calling a man a derogatory term.That’s when a woman wearing a “Nazi Lives Don’t Matter” shirt strode up to the diners’ table, grabbed a beverage, and drank it.In the background, demonstrators could be heard chanting “No justice, no peace,” a common Black Lives Matter slogan.The videos circulated widely on social media. One accrued more than 3 million views on Twitter alone.No arrests have been made.In this still image from video, a ""Black Lives Matter"" sign is seen in Portland, Ore., on Sept. 3, 2020. (Roman Balmakov/The Epoch Times)A police official confirmed that officers are investigating, before referring The Epoch Times to the Department of Public Safety for more information.The department didn’t respond to a request for comment.Harassment of diners has become an increasingly popular tactic during protests and riots. The tactic was seen during recent unrest in Rochester, New York, and Washington, D.C.Seven percent of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that took place between May 24 and Aug. 22 were violent, according to a recent report.The protest in Pittsburgh was organized by Black Lives Matter activists, local media reported.Demonstrators later marched to the home of Mayor Bill Peduto, a Democrat. Police officers stood outside the front door as people chanted.Peduto wrote on Twitter early Sept. 6: “Tonight at my home—private property. The 1st Amendment doesn’t protect you to close down streets, without a permit. Yes, we have granted extra rights to assure free speech. But, continual denial of law, will end up in arrests. Actions have consequences.”Peduto said the police were at his home “because twice protestors tried to enter through the front door.” He said people threatened to attack his house.“Same protection that would be given to any resident under similar threats,” he wrote.

Chiu/Shutterstock)By Louise Chambers4/17/2020Updated: 4/18/2020PrintWarning: This article includes content some readers may find disturbingThe parents of a critically ill 6-month-old baby girl battling the CCP virus are urging people to take social distancing measures even more seriously.When baby Erin Bates was born in October 2019, she had a complication with her windpipe, as well as a heart condition that required surgery, reported the Daily Mail. In January 2020, Erin suffered potentially fatal complications arising from a respiratory syncytial virus.The strong baby girl was on the road to recovery when, on April 10, 2020, her parents received heartbreaking news. At Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool, England, Erin tested positive for the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, commonly known as the novel coronavirus.“It’s all very hard to digest now,” Erin’s father, Wayne, 32, told the Lancashire Telegraph. “It doesn’t really feel like it’s happening to us, it feels more like I’m just watching this all as it happens to someone else.”Upon learning of his baby girl’s diagnosis, Wayne was instructed to self-isolate at the family home in Bury, Greater Manchester, while his wife, Emma, stayed with the couple’s daughter in the hospital.Shortly after Erin’s diagnosis, Emma, 29, released a distressing photo of her daughter according to BBC. In it, Erin lies in her hospital bed hooked up to a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine with numerous wires and tubes attached to her tiny body.The main entrance of Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, northwest England (PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty Images)Emma revealed that her continued support of her baby daughter relies upon her not getting sick herself. “If I show any symptoms I will then be taken to another hospital and Erin will be here alone,” she said. “This alone breaks my heart.”The couple is lauding the incredible efforts of the NHS in caring for their daughter but remain outraged by the not-insignificant fraction of people who are not taking the United Kingdom’s lockdown regulations seriously.“[It] upsets me,” Wayne explained, according to the Daily Mail. “I take it personally.” The father then regaled seeing a picture of a queue beside an ice cream vendor on the beach, and described public flouting of social distancing regulations as “horrific.”“People cannot continue to walk around still thinking that they will not get it,” Wayne told the Lancashire Telegraph, further urging people to take social distancing measures seriously. “People need to stay at home, it is the easiest thing ever that we are being asked to do.”(Illustration - C. Vanrintel/Shutterstock)Emma and Wayne were once told they might never conceive naturally. Upon Erin’s arrival, after a decade of trying to get pregnant, the couple was “over the moon” to welcome their baby girl into the world.As of April 13, 2020, Wayne maintains that his daughter is only alive due to the sterling efforts of the staff at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital. “All of the doctors and nurses have been really incredible and both Emma and I want to thank them from the bottom of our hearts for all they have done for Erin,” said Wayne.A pharmacy shows signs reminding us of social distancing on March 23, 2020 in London, England. (Julian Finney/Getty Images)“Never could we have wished for more kind and caring people to be looking after our baby,” the father continued. “They are all putting their own lives at risk for little reward. We are eternally grateful to them.”Wayne described the months leading up to baby Erin’s CCP virus diagnosis as “the lowest of the low,” adding that he and Emma had become accustomed to hearing that they may lose their daughter.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)By The Associated Press12/12/2016Updated: 12/12/2016PrintThe Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee are joining with Democrats in calling for an examination of reports that Russia interfered in the presidential election.Chairman John McCain, incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and others said in a joint statement Sunday that the CIA’s report of Russia’s efforts in the election “should alarm every American.”“I can’t reach that conclusion yet, which is why we need a bipartisan effort to uncover the whole situation,” said McCain on “CBS This Morning.”“It’s all part of the larger issue of the cyber threat that we face from Russia, China and other countries. It’s another form of warfare,” he added. “It’s a threat to our national security.”Sen. Chuck Schumer refers to a map while touring Washington Lake area in Newburgh on Aug. 9, 2016. (Yvonne Marcotte/Epoch Times)The leaders said they will push “to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security.” Russia was the only country mentioned in the statement.“This is serious stuff---when a foreign power tries to intervene to influence an election,” Schumer said, adding that he doesn’t want the investigation to become politicized. “It’s gotten worse and a bipartisan investigation that’s not aimed at one specific instance but looks at the broad scope of this is just what’s needed.”President Barack Obama ordered a full review of campaign-season cyberattacks to be completed before he leaves office. President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA’s assessment that Russia powered his defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton.Epoch Times contributed to this report Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowThe Associated PressAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesWorld Shares Follow Wall Street Higher as Japan’s Nikkei Nears Record HighFeb 16, 2024Lyme Disease Case Counts in the US Rose by Almost 70 Percent in 2022 Due to a Change in How It’s ReportedFeb 15, 2024Power Outages Hit Boston Transit System During Morning Rush Hour, Stranding ThousandsFeb 15, 20242 Chinese Fishermen Drown After Chase With Taiwan’s Coast Guard, Which Alleges TrespassingFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

Riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to clear protesters from the square as Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned he would show 'no more tolerance' for the unrelenting mass demonstrations against his government. (Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images) By Emel Akan6/11/2013Updated: 6/11/2013PrintISTANBUL—It’s the smoke of the tear gas, the smoldering fires, the burned out barricades, and the marks left by gasoline bombs scattered on the ground that make Istanbul’s Taksim square look like a battlefield.On Tuesday hundreds of police descended on the square in central Istanbul to clear it of protesters. It was the greatest show of force in one and a half weeks, after protests sparked by police intervention in protests against the construction of a shopping mall on a park on Taksim Square.Police actions continued into the night. Around midnight protesters, some holding banners, could still be seen gathered on the park grounds on the square with a hundreds of police present on the square, occasionally firing tear gas. Bulldozers started to remove some of the barricades.“Out of the blue, we heard a loud banging noise and subsequently, gas surrounded us. In fact, they fired them at our escape route, trapping us with gas. The woman behind me was crying “I’m dying, I’m dying”. Your lungs burn so badly that you feel like they are bleeding,” said one of the protesters present on Taksim square at the time of the police intervention, who wished to remain anonymous for safety reasons.“Police fired tear gas bombs at the crowd at Gezi Park indiscriminately. There were people of all ages,” the protester said.Istanbul Mayor Huseyin Avni Mutlu said in a televised announcement Tuesday that “we will continue our measures in an unremitting manner, whether day or night, until marginal elements are cleared and the square is open to the people,” according to Reuters.Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said earlier in the day, “What were we supposed to do? Kneel in front of these people and ask them remove the banners? How would those illegal rags be removed from public buildings?” according to Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily.Erdogan called on protesters to “see the big picture, understand the plot, and withdraw from the streets.”Some of the protesters could be seen hurling gasoline bombs and stones at police earlier in the day.Other protesters say they distance themselves from those actions, and insist they want to have a peaceful protest.Earlier in the day police arrested 49 lawyers who had gathered at the Caglayan courthouse in Istanbul, all of them were released after being taken to the police office.The ongoing protests reveal discontent among parts of Turkish society with Erdogan, and resemble similar protests that swept across the Arab nations in 2011. Turkey was then seen as a role model for some of the young democracies in the region.But protesters say that Erdogan has become increasingly authoritarian and conservative in his decade long rule, citing limitations on the sale of alcohol and restrictions on free speech.Additional reporting by Jasper Fakkert Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowEmel AkanAuthor (reporter)FollowEmel Akan is a senior White House correspondent for The Epoch Times, where she covers the Biden administration.

Rapid onset, severe hyponatraemia has been reported with proton-pump inhibitor therapy in non-pregnant individuals. Gastro-oesophageal reflux is very common during pregnancy, and proton-pump inhibitors are available without a prescription in many countries. A case of severe maternal hyponatraemia in the setting of recent omeprazole therapy is presented. Health professionals should be aware of this complication given the availability of proton-pump inhibitors without prescription and high rates of gestational gastro-oesophageal reflux.IntroductionIn normal pregnancy, serum sodium (Na+) falls by 3–5 mmol/L and average plasma osmolality by 5–10 mmol/L due to a reduction in osmotic threshold at which antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release and thirst stimulus occur.1 Pregnancy outcomes in the setting of maternal hyponatraemia depend on both the rate of decline of serum Na + levels and absolute serum Na + concentration.2 Clinical practice guidelines define mild hyponatraemia in non-pregnant individuals as serum Na + of 130–135 mmol/L, moderate 125–129 mmol/L, and severe less than 125 mmol/L as measured by an ion-specific electrode.3 Values defining the severity of hyponatraemia in pregnancy have not been delineated taking into account the physiological change in serum Na +. Complications of hyponatraemia include headache, nausea, seizures and cerebral oedema. Equilibration of serum sodium across the placenta results in neonatal hyponatraemia, with potential complications of neonatal jaundice, tachypnoea, vomiting, weakness, seizures and increased risk of neonatal intensive care admission. Measurement of neonatal serum sodium is important particularly as seizures have been reported in the neonates of asymptomatic women with hyponatraemia.4 A wide array of conditions is associated with hyponatraemia in pregnancy, hyperemesis gravidarum and preeclampsia the most common causes in the first and second half of pregnancy, respectively.5 Treatment options for severe hyponatraemia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) include fluid restriction, oral urea, hypertonic saline, oral salt tablets and vasopressin receptor antagonists. There is no safety data regarding the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists during pregnancy or breast feeding. Correction of maternal hyponatraemia must be undertaken judiciously given the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if serum Na + rises too rapidly.Case reportA 41-year-old woman presented for a booked induction of labour at 38 weeks of gestation. Her past history was significant for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy 3 years earlier. The woman’s preconception body mass index was 20.6 kg/m2. Routine pathology tests were collected and dinoprostone was administered at 0820 h. Labour was established at 1500 h. The laboratory subsequently reported the woman’s serum sodium had been 122 mmol/L (normal 130–145) on the pathology tests taken prior to induction. A review of previous results showed the woman’s serum sodium had been 134 mmol/L at 20 weeks of gestation. Repeat serum sodium at 1540 h was 119 mmol/L. The woman was asymptomatic and proceeded to deliver a healthy female infant birthweight 2922 g at 1650 h. The woman denied excessive intake of fluids. She initially claimed no pharmacotherapy, however on specific questioning had been taking omeprazole 20 mg once daily for several days per week over the previous month for gastro-oesophageal reflux, the medication obtained over the counter without a prescription. She denied the use of herbal or complementary therapy. There were no symptoms or signs of preeclampsia, and the woman was clinically euvolaemic. Glucose, lipids, immunoglobulins, thyroid, adrenal and renal function were normal. Urine sodium and osmolality were 54 mmol/L and 218 mOsm/kg, respectively, and serum urate was 0.23 mmol/L (normal range 0.15–0.45), consistent with SIADH. A fluid restriction of 750 mL/day was initiated. The following morning serum sodium had risen to 131 mmol/L, improving further to 134 mmol/L on the second postpartum day. The woman’s new-born had Apgar scores of 9 at 1 min and 10 at 5 min. The new born’s serum sodium was 123 mmol/L and established breastfeeding within 2 h of delivery without signs of hyponatraemia.DiscussionA review of maternal hyponatraemia in a tertiary referral hospital over a 10-year period found the prevalence of serum Na + less than 130 mmol/L after 20 weeks of gestation to be 4.1 cases per 1000 deliveries.6 Preeclampsia was the cause in 66.5% of cases other major causes including infection (13.4%), diabetes mellitus (3.1%) and acute fatty liver of pregnancy (2%). No cause was identified in 9.3% of cases. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in preeclampsia is 9–10%.6 Additional causes of gestational hyponatraemia described in the literature include water intoxication during labour, prolonged labour, caesarean section, cortisol deficiency (due to Sheehan’s syndrome, hypophysitis, Addison’s disease) and medications (oxytocin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, thiazide diuretics).A primary care database study found the point prevalence of prescription of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the United Kingdom was 7.7% in 2014.7 Rates of PPI prescription during pregnancy are not known, although up to 80% of women are affected by gestational gastro-oesophageal reflux.8 The possible association between pregnancy, hyponatraemia and PPI use has not been previously reported. PPI-associated hyponatraemia can be rapid-onset after commencing medication and may be associated with severe hyponatraemia with rapid recovery after cessation of therapy. Most cases occurred within 11 days of commencing therapy. One case report described a fall in serum sodium from 138 mmol/L (prior to therapy) to 117 mmol/L over a 36 h period.9 The clinical and biochemical findings in case reports are consistent with SIADH as the mechanism of hyponatraemia. A population-based case-control study found adjusted odds ratios for hospitalisation due to hyponatraemia for newly initiated PPIs were omeprazole 2.67, pantoprazole 2.06, esomeprazole 2.89 and any PPI 2.78.10 Two other studies found odds ratios indicating the association between PPI use and elderly patients with severe (OR 2.6) and moderate hyponatraemia (OR 4.4).11,12 A study of 97 children and adolescents showed a significant increase in the frequency of decreased serum sodium following initiation of omeprazole therapy, with 17.5% developing serum sodium less than 135 mmol/L.13In conclusion, proton-pump inhibitor therapy may be associated with the rapid onset of severe hyponatraemia. Health professionals involved in the care of pregnant women should be aware of this side-effect, particularly given the availability of PPIs without prescription.Ethical approvalEthical approval exemption by Mater Health Human Research and Ethics Committee.Declaration of conflicting interestsThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.FundingThe author received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.ORCID iDAdam Morton https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9887-714XReferences1.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)By Emel Akan9/24/2019Updated: 9/24/2019PrintNEW YORK—President Donald Trump warned world leaders about the “specter of socialism,” calling it one of the most serious challenges facing the nations.“It’s the wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies,” Trump said on Sept. 24 in his address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York.“Events in Venezuela remind us all that socialism and communism are not about justice, they are not about equality, they are not about lifting up the poor. And they are certainly not about the good of the nation,” he said.“Socialism and communism are about one thing only: power for the ruling class.”Leaders of countries around the world have gathered this week in New York for the 74th session of the UNGA. In his address, Trump repeated his pledge that the United States would “never be a socialist country.”Trump has repeatedly criticized Democrats for embracing “radical socialism” in the United States. He denounced a wide range of proposals by Democrats, such as open borders, Medicare for All, and the Green New Deal, calling them an “extreme, destructive, and dangerous agenda.”At a closed-door Republican annual conference on Sept. 12, Trump urged GOP lawmakers “to fight like hell” to win the 2020 election and defeat rising socialism in the United States.Trump said in his speech to the UNGA that socialism and communism killed 100 million people in the last century, and he condemned the “brutal oppression” of people in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela today.“The dictator Maduro is a Cuban puppet, protected by Cuban bodyguards, hiding from his own people,” he said.“These totalitarian ideologies combined with modern technology have the power to exercise new and disturbing forms of suppression and domination,” Trump said, defending the recent U.S. policy that requires increased screening of foreign technology and investment in the United States.‘History, Culture, and Heritage’Trump also pointed a finger at social media giants, media, and academic institutions.He accused social media companies of acquiring immense power and silencing people.“A small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense power over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say,” he said. “Media and academic institutions push flat-out assaults on our histories, traditions, and values.”Trump defended traditions and customs and asked the leaders to cherish the “history, culture, and heritage” of their countries.“The free world must embrace its national foundations. It must not attempt to erase them or replace them,” he said.“If you want freedom, take pride in your country. If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty. And if you want peace, love your nation.”Religious FreedomAt this year’s UNGA, Trump has made the protection of religious freedom a key focus. He hosted an event on Sept. 23 called “Global Call to Protect Religious Freedom,” which sought to gain international support for protecting religious leaders and religious freedom in the wake of increasing persecution around the world.“Today, with one clear voice, the United States of America calls upon the nations of the world to end religious persecution,” Trump said on Sept. 23.Trump drew criticism for scheduling his meeting on religious freedom during a climate change summit hosted by the U.N. secretary-general on Sept. 23.He attended the climate summit for 15 minutes before leaving for his own meeting booked at a separate conference room at the UN headquarters.Pastors and a number of Christian nongovernmental organizations throughout the country praised Trump for addressing the “real problem” of religious persecution.“It is a remarkable thing that this president would skip a UN climate change summit on an imaginary problem to address the very real problem of global persecution of believers,” Robert Jeffress, an American Southern Baptist pastor, told Fox & Friends.Almost 83 percent of the world’s population live in countries with high or very high religious restrictions, according to a 2018 study by Pew Research Center.

This DIY is a couple of months in the making and I hope that it is worth the wait. Before we get into the project, I would like to take a minute to tell you all about the paint that I used for this project — Country Chic Paint. This paint is amazing! Their colors are so crisp and bright. The paint is easy to work with and the finish is phenomenal! So, if you are need of some great paint, check them out! http://www.countrychicpaint.ca/ So this table that I made over belonged to my Auntie Grace, who was my great-great aunt. My Auntie Grace was the center of our family and we all loved her very dearly. We just couldn’t toss away her table, so we hung on to it, but is was pretty beat up. My mother and I decided that it was time to refinish it. Since, I already have a table that I am pretty fond of, I thought I would do this one up for my grandma’s basement. There is a little apartment down there and I am going to renovate it… so there will be lots of great projects and pictures to come! Since I am starting with a blank slate and no one lives down there I took this opportunity to have some fun and do something totally different — something out of my comfort zone. I picked colors from Country Chic that I would normally not ever even pick up. Take a look and see what I did! This is what I started with. Time to sand! I love sanding… I find it so relaxing. Very important to remember: after you are done sanding, make sure you ALWAYS wipe your furniture down really well before you bring out your paint. Now the fun part! Time to get out the paint!! For the table top and the tops of the chairs I used “Dark Roast” I don’t know if it is the lighting in the basement, but this paint looked like it had a navy tinge to it after I painted it on. It could also be an effect from the furniture that I was painting, too. It is weird because in the can it is a chestnut, dark brown. I allowed this to dry for two days before applying a coat of “Tough Coat”, which is also from Country Chic This top coat is amazing and really protects the wood and your furniture. Time for the legs! First, I painted all the legs in “Simplicity”. A most perfect shade of white. After all the legs were painted white, I let them dry fully. Now this is where I broke out of my comfort zone… Enter the most perfect shade of pink you have ever seen. It almost kind of looks like pink Pepto- stomach stuff. LOL But I fell in love with it. And normally I don’t throw a shade of pink like this in my decor because it seems like it is more for a kid’s room or something. But again, I wanted to break out of my comfort zone. I did a dry brush technique over top of the white legs. After the legs had dried for 24 hours, I applied some Pearl wax, which gave the legs a beautiful “pearl” like finish. All that was left was to put the look together! Since we are getting close to Christmas, I thought I would do up a nice Christmas table. I hung up this piece on the wall…. that I love and just had to share a close up! I picked this up off the side of the road… I didn’t do anything to it other than add the poinsettias and snowy greens. Isn’t it wonderful? And then my two favorites… these deer. Cute, right? Let me know what you think of this makeover!! And be sure to pick up some Country Chic Paint for your next project — you will LOVE it! There are tons more pictures on my blog, so head over and check out the full opist! Enjoyed the project?

(Courtesy of Jay Taylor)By Joshua Philipp7/13/2010Updated: 7/13/2010PrintStories of heroism often become nightmares—haunting memories, which many veterans struggle to cope with. Vietnam veteran Jay Taylor still recalls an ambush he and his partners set at a river crossing during the war. They killed eight people that day, and the action won Taylor a Bronze Star. The medal has now become a “stressor”—proof that Taylor is eligible for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatment. “The one thing about PTSD is you’re never cured from it,” said Taylor over the phone on July 13. “It’s just a matter of how well you learn to live with it, and then control it.” Taylor, like thousands of other suffers from PTSD. He spent 13 months in Vietnam as an elite member of the 7th Marine Scout Sniper Platoon Bravo Company. He spent another 40 years reliving the horrors of war through memories, which few could shake. Now living in his old hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico, Taylor has learned to cope. He spends his time as a thoroughbred racehorse breeder, and is the author of “Point of Aim Point of Impact,” which recounts his two tours in Vietnam, and the battle he endured following his return home. “It’s more retirement age, when your mind is not busy anymore, when some of that stuff can come back and impact you,” Taylor said. Although Taylor has been able to get treatment for PTSD, thousands of other veterans have been rejected. Until recently, in order to get PTSD treatment, veterans needed to have documented proof of their “stressors”—incidents, which would make them eligible. The policy was only changed just this week. During his July 10 weekly address, President Barack Obama announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will no longer require a confirmed stressor in order for veterans to be diagnosed with PTSD. The decision will now be on VA psychiatrists and psychologists, who will determine if a veteran’s experience supports a PTSD diagnosis, and whether the veteran’s symptoms result from the incidents. Obama said that the practice of requiring veterans to give evidence of the incident which caused their PTSD “... has kept the vast majority of those with PTSD who served in noncombat roles, but who still waged war, from getting the care they need.” Taylor agrees, and shared his belief that the new policy is “going to be a benefit to a lot of veterans who have had difficulty getting help with PTSD.” Roadblocks to Treatment For some occupations, stressors were a given. As a scout sniper, “I have plenty of documentation of stressors,” said Taylor. He added that others—such as gunners on choppers—also had an easy time proving their stressors. While leaving a hot landing zone, and firing at the enemy, “They’d see their machine guns cut them down, and then they see the wounded and the maimed getting on the choppers,” said Taylor. For others, it hasn’t been so easy. Military doctors and nurses are among those who have traditionally had trouble getting treatment. Taylor said he knew a man in the Navy who was on a helicopter near a ship during Vietnam. The helicopter malfunctioned and crashed into the ocean. He was the only survivor, and was never eligible for PTSD treatment since he was not in a combat zone. Even for those who saw combat, being diagnosed wasn’t always easy. The need to provide evidence of a stressor is sometimes a block even for veterans who were in combat. “Those details may be forever burned into our minds, but we often don’t come away with hard copy proof of what occurred,” said Tammy Duckworth, assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs at the Department of Veterans Affairs, in a July 12 post on the White House blog. “The previous arrangement is neither fair, nor sustainable,” Duckworth said. “This is especially true in the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan where there are no static front lines and the combat zone is everywhere.” Even with the new standards in place, however, Taylor shared that veterans may still face problems getting treatment—not from any government body, but rather from themselves. “One thing that I think everybody needs to understand—families, relatives, and the returning veterans—is you cannot go through something like that and not be affected by it,” said Taylor. “That’s normal, and they tend to think that after they come back, that there’s something wrong with them if they’re affected by it.” “What we’re really afraid of is how we will be judged if we do talk about it,” said Taylor.

AV graft failure is often due to stenosis of the feeding artery, graft, or draining vein. We report four cases of AV graft dysfunction and failure rarely caused by graft delamination and dissection. Two males and two females aged 47–67 years had been on chronic hemodialysis. Ultrasound examination detected graft delamination and dissection between 1 and 33 months after Acuseal AV graft implantation. Two cases were successfully treated with stenting and partial graft replacement, respectively. False lumen volume reduction by fluid withdrawal failed to salvage the delaminated graft in one of the patients. The delamination and dissection of another case spontaneously resolved 5 months later. Graft delamination and dissection should be considered as a possible cause for AV graft dysfunction and failure. Stenting and graft replacement may be recommended to treat AV graft dissection and delamination.IntroductionAlthough arteriovenous (AV) fistulas are preferred vascular access for chronic hemodialysis, AV grafts may be necessary if fistulas have failed.1 AV grafts have higher risk of failure, which is often due to stenotic or thrombotic lesions in the feeding arteries, grafts, artery-graft/vein-graft anastomoses, or draining veins.2 In this case study, we report four cases of AV graft dysfunction and failure due to graft delamination and dissection. AV graft delamination or dissection is a recently identified, uncommon cause of graft failure. A few cases of graft delamination have been reported last year.3–5 However, the clinical characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of AV graft delamination and dissection are largely unknown probably due to inadequate clinical observation and limited case reports. Moreover, the treatment of graft delamination or dissection has not been standardized. In this case report, we describe four cases with Acuseal graft delamination and dissection and their responses to different types of treatments.Case presentationThe main clinical characteristics of these four cases are summarized in Table 1.Table 1. Clinical characteristics of the reported cases.Case1234GenderFemaleMaleMaleFemaleAge (years)47605367Graft typesBrachial-cephalicBrachial-basilicSuperficial femoral-great saphenousRadial-basilicTime to delamination (months)133237CanulizationNoYesYesYesLocationNonpuncture siteNonpuncture siteNonpuncture siteNonpuncture siteTreatmentObservationStentingRadial-basilicPartial replacementCase report 1A 47-year-old female with end-stage renal disease had been on hemodialysis using a radial-cephalic fistula in the right arm and a brachial-cephalic fistula in the left arm for 3.5 years. Eight months ago, a brachial-cephalic loop Acuseal graft (6 mm, W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was implanted in the left forearm below the elbow joint. The AV graft was never punctured or canalized for hemodialysis. The patient was not on anti-platelet or anti-coagulation medications. At 1-month postoperative visit, ultrasound examination detected delamination and dissection in the graft segment below the elbow joint located 5 cm away from the venous anastomosis (Figure 1(a)). The delamination resulted in a luminal narrowing with the luminal diameter of 1.7 mm and a filling defect shown in color Doppler ultrasonography (Figure 1(b)). The brachial arterial blood flow was 2227 mL/min, and the resistance index was 0.34. The delamination and dissection were untreated and left for regular follow-up surveillance. Five months later, the AV graft delamination and dissection disappeared (Figure 1(c)) and the graft blood flow restored spontaneously (Figure 1(d)).Figure 1. Ultrasound imaging of case 1.

Three years ago, a brachial-basilic loop Acuseal graft (6 mm) was implanted across the elbow joint in the left arm for hemodialysis. Since then, the graft had been punctured for regular hemodialysis. The patient was not on anti-platelet or anti-coagulation therapy. Seven months ago, the time required for routine hemostasis was remarkably prolonged due to increased venous pressure. Ultrasound examination found dissection and delamination in the graft which was located in the upper arm and 5 cm away from the venous anastomosis (Figure 2(a)). The diameter of the graft was narrowed to 2.2 mm with a significant filling defect (Figure 2(b)). The brachial arterial blood flow was 345 mL/min, and the resistance index was 0.62. The delaminated and narrowed graft was dilated using a high-pressure balloon (6 mm × 40 mm, Conquest, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and a covered stent (Viabahn endoprosthesis, 6 mm × 5 cm, W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was placed. The graft narrowing was resolved by the stenting (Figure 2(c)), and the blood flow was restored (Figure 2(d)). After the procedure, the brachial arterial blood flow was 1563 mL/min, and the resistance index was 0.42.Figure 2. Ultrasound imaging of case 2. (a) Dissection and delamination of the Acuseal graft.

Two years ago, a loop Acuseal graft (6 mm, inflow, superficial femoral artery; outflow, great saphenous vein) was implanted in the left lower extremity below the inguinal region for hemodialysis. Then, the graft had been punctured for regular hemodialysis. Since the procedure, the patient had been on oral aspirin (100 mg/d) but not on anti-coagulation therapy. Eighteen months ago, the venous pressure was significantly increased during hemodialysis. Ultrasound examination detected a graft dissection and delamination located 3 cm away from the venous anastomosis below the inguinal region (Figure 3(a)). The luminal diameter was significantly decreased to 2.2 mm. The superficial femoral arterial blood flow was 201 mL/min, and the resistance index was 0.66. We punctured the false lumen of the dissected graft and withdrew 2.8 mL blood. After the procedure, the graft dissection and delamination were partially resolved, and the luminal diameter was increased to 3.9 mm (Figure 3(b) and (c)). The superficial femoral arterial blood flow was restored to 1652 mL/min, and the resistance index was 0.33. Since then, the graft continued to be used for hemodialysis without puncturing the dissected and delaminated segment. Eight months ago, ultrasound examination found multiple dissections with luminal thrombus formation in the graft (Figure 3(d)). The dissected graft might be able to be rescued by implanting multiple covered stents, which could largely reduce the region for future punctures. Therefore, the graft was then abandoned.Figure 3.

Ultrasound (b) and color Doppler image (c) after false lumen volume reduction by fluid withdrawal. (d) Ultrasound imaging shows multiple dissections with luminal thrombus formation 10 months later.Case report 4A 67-year-old female was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease. Eight months ago, a radial-basilic straight Acuseal graft (6 mm) was implanted across the elbow joint in the right arm since the AV fistula access failed. The AV graft was used for hemodialysis 48 h after implantation. The patient did not receive anti-platelet or anti-coagulation medications. One month ago, the venous pressure started to increase during hemodialysis. One day prior to admission, the thrill over the AV graft disappeared. Ultrasound examination found graft thrombosis with a dissection and delamination in the graft segment above the elbow joint (Figure 4(a)). A procedure was performed to remove the dissected graft segment. Dark color indicated dissection of the posterior wall of the Acuseal graft (Figure 4(b)). The dissected segment of the Acuseal graft was removed. Dissection of the posterior graft wall was confirmed, and stagnant blood was found in the false lumen (Figure 4(c) and (d)). A Stretch vascular graft (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was used to connect the remaining segment of the Acuseal graft and the basilic vein (Figure 4(e)). At 1 month follow-up, ultrasound examination showed no dissection or delamination in the grafts and no stenosis at the anastomosis of the two grafts (Figure 4(f)).Figure 4.

With the previous reported cases,3–5 there are 12 cases of Acuseal graft dissection and delamination. In addition, there is a case report that described a dissection of a Hybrid AV graft.3 However, the delamination and dissection rate of the Acuseal grafts remains unknown. All four cases in the present report are related to the Acuseal graft. The Acuseal graft is a tri-layer vascular conduit consisting of an elastomeric middle layer and the inner and outer expanded polytetrafluoroethylene layers, which can be used for hemodialysis almost immediately after implant.6 It is possible that the tri-layer design makes the Acuseal graft prone to delaminate. The Hybrid graft is a monolayer graft. At present, it is not clear whether the Acuseal graft has higher risk of delamination and dissection than the Hybrid graft. It is no doubt that many cases of graft dissection or delamination are undetected since regular ultrasound examination is not used on the surveillance in all centers.Cannulization may be a possible trigger for graft delamination and dissection. The separation occurs between the middle silicone layer and the outer polytetrafluoroethylene layer of the Acuseal graft. If the adhesion between these two layers is relatively weak, cannulization may provide a tear point for the blood flow to dissect the graft. However, the dissection and delamination of all four cases were not located at the canulization site. Moreover, the graft of case 1 was never punctured before graft delamination occurred. The grafts did not receive any percutaneous transluminal interventions before the dissection and delamination were detected. Therefore, there might be some other unknown factors that contribute to Acuseal graft delamination and dissection. A previous study demonstrated that two cases of the delamination occurred at the elbow joint, suggesting that the delamination might be due to the repeated movement of the elbow.5 However, none of the delamination and dissections in the present study occurred at any joints. In the present study, the patients did not receive anti-platelet, anti-coagulation, or thrombolytic therapies except that only one patient was on aspirin treatment. Therefore, the graft delamination and dissection were unlikely attributed to anti-thrombotic medications. In general, graft dissection and delamination can occur at puncture sites or nonpuncture sites in grafts with or without previous canulization. Problems of adhesion among the three layers in the Acuseal graft might contribute to cannulation-unrelated graft dissection and delamination.There is no standard treatment for graft delamination and dissection. Stenting and observation without intervention have been used in previous studies.4,5 The four cases in the present report were managed with observation, stenting, false lumen volume reduction, and graft replacement, respectively. From the limited data and experience, covered stents and graft replacement or partial replacement are preferred treatment for graft delamination and dissection. False lumen volume reduction by fluid withdrawal failed to salvage the graft, so it is not recommended. Interestingly, the graft dissection and delamination in case 1 subsided spontaneously without intervention 5 months later. This suggests some graft dissections and delamination may be self-limited. However, the mechanism underlying the self-restoration remains elusive. In a previous study, three cases with graft delamination had been under observation without intervention for 3–5 months, but self-restoration was not observed.5 Therefore, whether the graft dissection and delamination need intervention warrants further investigation.ConclusionTaken together, graft dissection and delamination should be considered as a possible cause for AV graft dysfunction or failure. Stenting and graft replacement may be recommended to treat graft dissection and delamination. In the future, head-to-head clinical trials comparing the Acuseal graft with other grafts will be needed to conclude whether the Acuseal graft has higher risk of dissection and delamination than others.Informed consentInformed consent for patient information to be published was provided by all individuals in this study.

(Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images)By Ivan Pentchoukov6/17/2020Updated: 6/17/2020PrintLeaders in the Orthodox Jewish community are outraged by the apparent double standard exhibited by New York City authorities in the enforcement of lockdown measures.They say Mayor Bill de Blasio has singled out the Jewish community as part of his effort to stop the spread of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus.The double standard came into full focus on June 13, when de Blasio allowed thousands of people to attend a densely packed rally for “trans black lives” in Brooklyn. Days earlier, videos posted on social media showed city authorities welding shut the gates of a popular playground in one of the largest Jewish communities in the same borough.“Unfortunately, it’s very sadly familiar—the fact that Bill de Blasio called out the Jewish community in a way that he wouldn’t call out any other community,” Rabbi Yaakov Menken, managing director for the Coalition for Jewish Values, told The Epoch Times.Menken says pandemic data shows the spread of the virus in the Jewish community is no different from any of the others in New York City.“The statistics say one thing, and the narrative coming out of the government says something else. And there’s complete tolerance—good tolerance—for peaceful protesters who are violating social distancing rules as they march together,” Menken said. “Yet, Jewish kids playing on a playground, who are at extremely low risk from this virus, are at the same time being singled out.”The “trans black lives” rally in Brooklyn was the latest in a series of protests and riots that swept the country in the wake of the police-custody death in Minneapolis of George Floyd. De Blasio spoke at one of the protests, facing a crowd not practicing the social distancing guidelines and not wearing a mask himself.“I think the problem starts out when government officials make rules, and then decide to make an exception to their own rules and join in on this exception,” Yossi Gestetner, co-founder of the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council, told The Epoch Times.“If you set policy and then you make an exception to the rules, on your own choice, you’re a dictator. And that’s not how freedom and liberties work in the United States.”Gestetner noted that African Americans are statistically more vulnerable to adverse outcomes from the CCP virus. Yet the city’s leaders allowed a mass protest without the familiar reminders about social distancing and wearing masks.“Why are you subjecting a minority community to an outbreak in the name of helping the same community? It’s diabolical,” Gestetner said.Rabbi Joseph Potasnik, executive vice president of the New York Board of Rabbis, told The Epoch Times that his organization is actively consulting with several prominent epidemiologists about the precautions needed to reopen houses of worship. The scientists the board spoke to all concur that New York’s limitations on congregations are reasonable and necessary.“You don’t have any disagreement amongst the health professionals, that we shouldn’t be lenient when it comes to opening these houses of worship,” Posatnik said. “I understand the stringency, I just don’t understand why we’re not enforcing that kind of standard on protesters.” Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowIvan PentchoukovAuthor FollowIvan is the national editor of The Epoch Times.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

The Vikings benched Peterson for Sunday's game after his attorney said he had been indicted by a Texas grand jury on a charge of child abuse. Attorney Rusty Hardin says the charge accuses Peterson of using a branch, or switch, to spank his son. He says Peterson has cooperated with authorities and ""used his judgment as a parent to discipline his son."" Hardin says Peterson regrets the incident but never intended to harm the boy. (AP Photo/Tom Gannam, File)By Jack Phillips9/16/2014Updated: 9/16/2014PrintMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson’s booking on a child abuse charge Saturday has created another crisis for the embattled NFL, already derided for not responding strongly enough to acts of domestic violence by its players.It also has touched off a national debate about the role of corporal punishment in parenting.In the eyes of a Texas grand jury, Peterson crossed the line when he repeatedly struck his son with a tree branch, or switch, in May. Peterson’s attorney has said he has never run from what happened — and thatPeterson was inflicting the same discipline he endured as a child.“Obviously, parents are entitled to discipline their children as they see fit, except when that discipline exceeds what the community would say is reasonable,” Montgomery County Prosecutor Phil Grant said about 12 hours after Peterson was booked and released from jail on $15,000 bond. He is charged with causing injury to a child age 14 or younger.Peterson, one of the NFL’s most popular players and widely considered one of the best running backs to ever play, flew from Minnesota to Houston in the early morning hours after authorities indicted him on Friday evening. He has a home in both locations.The Vikings almost immediately decided to deactivate him for Sunday’s game against the New England Patriots, and NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said on Saturday that Peterson’s case “will be reviewed under the NFL’s personal conduct policy.”The situation comes as the NFL proceeds with a self-commissioned investigation by a former FBI director into how it handled the case of Ray Rice, who knocked his then-fiancee unconscious in an Atlantic City elevator. Rice was released Monday from the Baltimore Ravens after a video surfaced that showed the violence. The NFL said it hadn’t seen the video before then, but a law enforcement source told the AP it was sent to a league executive’s office in April and provided a voice mail confirming it was received.Unlike Rice’s situation, Peterson’s case is complicated by his stance that he meant his son no harm but rather was applying the same discipline he experienced growing up.“Adrian is a loving father who used his judgment as a parent to discipline his son. He used the same kind of discipline with his child that he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas,” Peterson’s attorney, Rusty Hardin, said.Steve Eudey, who coached Peterson as a young boy in Palestine, Texas, and has remained a family friend, said he has heard stories from Peterson about his father Nelson “being a firm disciplinarian.”“Some of the things his dad did to him was to make him tough,” Eudey told The Associated Press.Eudey said he had yet to speak to Peterson since his arrest, but said his actions were consistent with the type of upbringing he had.“I will go to my grave defending Adrian, but at the same time you can’t harm a child, either,” Eudey said. “I know that was never his intent.”Grant, the Texas prosecutor, said the grand jury felt the charge was warranted after spending several weeks reviewing “lots of evidence.”It’s not unusual for people subjected to physical discipline as children to use corporal punishment against their own children, experts say, and courts will sometimes consider that as a mitigating factor when sentencing an abuser. Peterson faces up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine if found guilty.News of Peterson’s charges led several prominent athletes to tweet about their experiences with corporal punishment when they were children.“Am I the only one that got hit with a switch? I had to go outside and pick my own switch. It taught values, respect (and) accountability,” former NBA star Tracy McGrady said. But he later qualified those remarks, tweeting, “Disciplining a child is vital. Of course any early physical punishment should be within reason, not overboard, and inside certain boundaries.”While the legal process plays out, the NFL is facing a potential test case for the tougher penalties it declared last month for players involved with domestic violence.Commissioner Roger Goodell announced an initial offense will draw a six-week suspension without pay, though “more severe discipline will be imposed if there are aggravating circumstances such as the presence or use of a weapon, choking, repeated striking, or when the act is committed against a pregnant woman or in the presence of a child.”It is not clear if Peterson’s case will invoke those penalties.Corporal punishment is legal in Texas, and the law spells out that non-deadly force against a child by a parent or guardian is permissible.But the punishment is abusive if it causes injury. While a blow that causes a red mark that fades in an hour is not likely to be judged abusive, a blow that leaves a bruise, welt, or swelling, or requires medical attention, could be judged abusive. The child’s injuries will likely be under scrutiny as the case proceeds.The guidelines also say while spanking with the bare, open hand is least likely to be abusive, use of an instrument “is cause for concern.”The Vikings jumped ahead of the NFL and the legal system by shelving Peterson for the game Sunday. Two other teams — Carolina and San Francisco — have taken heat for allowing players involved in alleged recent domestic violence incidents to continue to play.The team — and the league — will likely face scrutiny as they decide whether Peterson returns to the field as the legal process plays out. As of Saturday, no decision had been made about his outlook this season, and no court date had been set in Texas.

The census is conducted every 10 years. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)By Matthew Vadum2/12/2019Updated: 2/13/2019PrintA federal judge has rejected an activist group’s request to prevent the Trump administration from asking 2020 Census respondents if they are U.S. citizens.In recent decades, Democrats and Republicans have fought bitterly over how the decennial, constitutionally mandated head count is carried out.The Obama administration tried to wrest control over the census from the U.S. Department of Commerce but backed down. At the time, then-Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) called the move a “naked political power grab.”The Clinton administration wanted to use statistical modeling or sampling to produce census figures, but that move was ruled unconstitutional in 1999 by the Supreme Court. The Republicans of the day said Democrats were trying to inflate the count in their big-city strongholds to manipulate the congressional apportionment process to benefit their side.The legal victory for the Trump administration came Feb. 8, when Judge Dabney Friedrich of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia threw out an application for a preliminary injunction filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center.The group argued that the government should have conducted a privacy impact assessment (PIA) before adding the citizenship question.The court disagreed. The U.S. Census Bureau did not violate the law when it decided “to collect citizenship data before conducting, reviewing, or releasing a PIA addressing that decision,” Friedrich wrote in her ruling.The Electronic Privacy Information Center vowed to move forward with its lawsuit, despite the setback. The lawsuit is one of about a half-dozen challenging the Trump administration’s plans for next year’s census. In New York, a federal judge ordered the citizenship question be taken out of the census. That case is expected to be heard by the Supreme Court.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is expected to testify before Congress in March about how he decided to include the question. Ross said the Department of Justice asked for the question to be added, but Democrats say emails showed he discussed the issue with White House officials before that.The Commerce Department, which houses the Census Bureau, announced the inclusion of a citizenship question in the upcoming census last year. One of the reasons given for adding the question, which until the 1950s was a staple of the census, was to help identify possible violations of the Voting Rights Act.More recently, the question has been included in the smaller, more detailed study, the Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey, which is sent to about 3.5 million households annually.Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, has applauded the addition of the citizenship question. “The public has a right to expect that the government will do everything in its power to get as accurate a picture as possible of the American body politic,” he said.But last year, Democratic politicians vehemently denounced putting the question in the census, accusing the Trump administration of having sinister ulterior motives.Chair of the Democratic National Committee Tom Perez said the move was “a craven attack on our democracy and a transparent attempt to intimidate immigrant communities.” The census is not supposed to be “a political tool for Donald Trump to push his agenda and disempower Latinos and other people of color.”Perez said restoring the citizenship question stokes “fear” that makes immigrant communities “invisible.” In reality, they are “guaranteeing an inaccurate count that lays the groundwork for sustained racial gerrymandering and jeopardizes critical resources for communities across the country.”Timothy Olson, associate director for field operations at the U.S. Census Bureau, said he hopes the legal dispute is resolved soon because his agency faces a “hard deadline in June” for finalizing the questions that will be printed on the questionnaires.“We will conduct the census with or without the citizenship question,” Olson said, according to the Albuquerque Journal.“My job, and all of my peers’ job, is to make sure the census is as accurate as possible. We’re just waiting for a final decision to go to print. If the decision is delayed, that presents new challenges for us. We’re hopeful that firm direction will be provided, so we know which version to print.”Olson said more than $675 billion in federal funding is at stake. That money is allocated to states, counties, cities, and Indian tribes each year, according to census findings.

(Reuters/Mariana Bazo)“As of this Saturday the government will require that anyone entering Ecuador present his or her passport,” Ecuador’s Interior Minister Mauro Toscanini said. The Foreign Ministry later said it would apply specifically to Venezuelans.Ecuador declared a state of emergency in three provinces this month after a spike in Venezuelan migrants crossing the Ecuadorean-Colombian border high in the Andean mountains.Authorities said up to 4,500 Venezuelans were crossing daily, compared with around 500 to 1,000 previously.An official at Ecuador’s Foreign Ministry told local radio that some 600,000 Venezuelans had entered the country so far this year, with around 109,000 staying on.Unable to afford flights and often earning a minimum wage of just a few dollars a month, Venezuelans have been taking days-long bus rides across South America, many passing through Ecuador on their way south to Peru or Chile.Venezuelan migrants wait at the Interpol headquarters to get paperwork needed for a temporary residency permit, in Lima, Peru, August 16, 2018. (Reuters/Mariana Bazo)Peru is also planning to require passports from Venezuelans soon, two government sources said on condition of anonymity ahead of a pending announcement.Immigration officials estimated that there are nearly 400,000 Venezuelans in Peru, most of whom entered this year.About 20 percent of Venezuelans enter Peru without a passport, Peru’s interior minister said earlier this week.Venezuelan migrants wait at the Interpol headquarters to get paperwork needed for a temporary residency permit in Lima, Peru, August 16, 2018. (Reuters/Mariana Bazo)Venezuelans selling food or knick-knacks on the streets have become a common sight in Lima and Quito, raising fears among locals that the migrants could take their jobs and increase crime.Ecuador’s President Lenin Moreno is left-wing like his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro, but he has distanced himself from Caracas since taking office last year.Centrist Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra took office in March after his predecessor, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a vocal critic of Maduro, resigned in a scandal.Reporting by Mitra Taj Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowReutersAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesDollar on Track for 5th Straight Weekly Gain, Yen FragileFeb 16, 2024Oil Slips as Weaker IEA Demand Outlook Offsets Rate Cut HopesFeb 16, 20242 Fans Came to See Kansas City Chiefs; They Stopped Suspected ShooterFeb 15, 2024Wall Street Opens Flat After Mixed Economic DataFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsVenezuelaPerumigrationCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)By The Associated Press11/25/2015Updated: 11/25/2015PrintBRUSSELS—After a four-day shutdown prompted by a threat alert across Brussels, schools are reopening their doors with the help of beefed up security, including police armed with machine guns.Though the Belgian capital continues to be under the highest-level threat alert, meaning that an attack is serious and imminent, schools and subways began reopening across the city on Wednesday. That is restoring a sense of normality to the city, parts of which have been deserted since the alert was first raised to the top level in the capital on Saturday.The threat level is expected to be in place until at least Monday unless there are significant developments, like the capturing of suspects linked to the Paris attacks on Nov. 13.At Brussels’ College Saint-Jean-Berchmans, some parents gave their children a quick kiss before dropping them off, while several police officers guarded the entrance, including one with a visible machine gun. Among the students at the school is Belgium’s Princess Eleonore.“I’m concerned, but I think that life must go on,” said Dimitri De Cra Yencour, a father of four. “Even if something happens in Paris or in Brussels, they have to go back to school,” he said, adding he had instructed his children be extra attentive and to tell their teachers if they saw anything unusual.READ MOREBrussels Extends High Alert, Citing ‘Imminent’ ThreatBrussels to Stay on Highest Threat Alert Into MondayAt other schools in the region, officials sent parents letters and emails explaining security measures being taken under police orders, like limiting access to the school and not allowing children to play or gather in large spaces like courtyards.Some children looked visibly worried as they arrived at the upscale Brussels school but most gave a friendly handshake to a burly school official guarding the entrance alongside the police officers.Father Didier Nkoy Balengola said he had explained to his children that “there are some bad men who for no reason want to hurt innocent people” but he had confidence in the police.Others said that after the terror-sparked school vacation this week, it was definitely time for classes to re-start.READ MOREBelgium Terror Threat: Grote Markt, Radisson, Rue du Midi Closed in Brussels - Live Updates“It was like Christmas come early for the children,” said Annalaure Leger, a mother of two. “They stayed at home and played with the neighbors’ kids.” Leger said their family lives partly in Paris and that the children are very aware of what’s happening both there and in Belgium. She said that Wednesday’s school drop-off wasn’t much different from any other day, except for the presence of camera crews snapping their arrival.Leger said that neither she nor her children were too concerned about an imminent attack.“It would be better if the police had caught the terrorists, but the children know they are trying to do that so that everyone is safe.” Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowThe Associated PressAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesWorld Shares Follow Wall Street Higher as Japan’s Nikkei Nears Record HighFeb 16, 2024Lyme Disease Case Counts in the US Rose by Almost 70 Percent in 2022 Due to a Change in How It’s ReportedFeb 15, 2024Power Outages Hit Boston Transit System During Morning Rush Hour, Stranding ThousandsFeb 15, 20242 Chinese Fishermen Drown After Chase With Taiwan’s Coast Guard, Which Alleges TrespassingFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsParisEuropeterrorismBelgiumschoolsextremistsattacksBrusselsISISalertCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

(Manan Vatsyayana/AFP/Getty Images)By Ivan Pentchoukov6/21/2017Updated: 6/21/2017PrintUnites States satellites have detected activity at a North Korean nuclear test site for the first time in several weeks, two officials told CNN.The movement was detected near an entrance to an underground tunnel. U.S. officials are aware that the site can be used for an underground test, but can not yet tell if a sixth nuclear test is imminent. There is concern that the North may conduct a test during a Wednesday visit by senior Chinese diplomats and military officials.The military options for the United States in case of a North Korean nuclear test have recently been updated, the officials told CNN, but it is still unclear if any action will be taken.President Trump said in a Twitter message on Tuesday that although he appreciates “the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!”China is North Korea’s sole trading partner. Trump reached an accord with China’s leader Xi Jinping regarding North Korea when the two met in Florida. The Chinese have blocked North Korean coal shipments, tightened border controls, and in at least one high-profile investigation, taken down a businesswoman found to be aiding the Kim regime’s nuclear weapons development.Trump’s message came on the day after the death of Otto Warmbier, who arrived in the United States in a coma after being imprisoned in North Korea. The U.S. state department issued a statement on Monday blaming North Korea for Warbier’s unjust imprisonment.South Korea also confirmed on Tuesday, June 20, that a crashed drone it discovered earlier this month was North Korean and photographs recovered from the drone show proof of its route from North Korea into South Korea. South Korea described the drone as a “grave provocation” that violated the Korean War truce.A small aircraft, which South Korea's Military says is a drone from North Korea, is seen at the Defense Ministry in Seoul, South Korea, June 21, 2017. (Lee Jung-hoon/Yonhap via Reuters)The drone had been found with roughly 550 photographs and the military assessed it aimed to collect information on South Korean military bases and the anti-missile Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system located in Seongju, South Korea, 217 km (135 miles) south of Seoul.Leo Timm and Reuters contributed to this report.

Friends Read FreeWith Baron Davis out the Knicks may ask either Jeremy Lin (L) or Carmelo Anthony to play a few minutes at point guard. (Chris Trotman/Getty Images)By Dave Martin5/7/2012Updated: 10/1/2015PrintThe Knicks are in a bit of a quandary for Wednesday’s Game 5 against Miami. Not only are they facing their second straight elimination game, down 3–1 in the series; they'll be without the services of injured point guard Baron Davis. Davis left Sunday’s game with a dislocated right patella. Knicks coach Mike Woodson has already announced that veteran guard Mike Bibby will get the start in Davis’s absence, but Bibby certainly can’t play the whole game. During the regular season the soon-to-be 34-year-old broke the 30-minute barrier just twice during the regular season in averaging just 2.6 points and 2.1 assists per game—far and away career lows for someone who was one of the best in the league at his position a decade ago. Fortunately for the Knicks, Bibby is at his best in the clutch. The Arizona-alum led the underdog Wildcats to the National Championship in 1997, as a freshman. Five years later his fearless play against the vaunted Lakers in the conference finals officially put him on the map of the NBA’s best point guards. When he’s not on the floor though, or if he can’t turn back the clock against the Heat, here are the Knicks’ options: 1. Play Toney Douglas, if healthy. Douglas has not played at all this series, partly because of an unspecified illness and partly because Davis, Bibby, and Jeremy Lin had passed him on the depth chart. Pros: Douglas is quicker and a better defensive player than the slower Bibby. If healthy he should be well-rested since he hasn’t seen the court since April 20. Cons: Douglas is not a great offensive player. He hit just 32.4 percent of his field goal attempts on the season, and that includes playing meaningful minutes in December and January. Also his prolonged absence from the court might mean he’s fresh, but there should be plenty of rust as well. 2. Rush Jeremy Lin back into action. Lin has been out since March 24 and is recovering from knee surgery. Pros: When healthy he’s the best point guard on the roster after his breakout season this year. His play-making skills especially would come in handy in a series where the Knicks offense has often looked stale. In addition, the energy he brings to the court would nice change of pace for Mike Woodson’s club. Cons: There is a school of thought that says anytime you bring a player from a prolonged absence back into a team’s regular rotation—no matter how good they are—it requires an adjustment period before the team gels together again. Lin, who has missed 21 of the 28 games that Mike Woodson has been coach would definitely require an adjustment period. In addition, with the team just one loss away from a first-round playoff exit, it may not be wise to test his surgically repaired knee at this time. If they were in the finals, that would be another thing. 3. Put Carmelo Anthony at the point. Pros: Woodson already wants the ball in Anthony’s hands as the offense goes through him anyway. Plus his height (6‘8“) at the position would create matchup problems for the Heat defensively. The Knicks could put him alongside J.R. Smith (6’6”) or Landry Fields (6‘7“) at shooting guard with Steve Novak (6’10”) and Amar‘e Stoudemire (6’10“) at the forward positions and Tyson Chandler (7'1”) at center. The lack of quickness would be mitigated by their rebounding advantage and the likelihood to be able find a favorable post-up opportunity at nearly every individual matchup on the floor. Cons: Having Carmelo at the point is not a lineup the Knicks have put on the floor this season and might require a little adjustment for the team to get used to. The Heat would also have an opportunity to speed up the pace of the game with a smaller lineup. What will happen: Bibby will go for about 35 minutes, Douglas will give him a 5-minute breather, and Mike Woodson will try Carmelo (and maybe even J.R. Smith) at the point the rest of the time, while Lin continues to rehab.The Epoch Times publishes in 35 countries and in 19 languages. Subscribe to our e-newsletter.

Garlic powder spiked with talc is just one of the many examples of food fraud. (The Canadian Press/AP-Chinatopix, China Out)By Jared Gnam4/12/2017Updated: 4/23/2017PrintFrom wood pulp found in grated Parmesan cheese, to garlic powder spiked with talc, to the recent massive case of adulterated or spoiled meat products from leading exporter Brazil, food fraud is a widespread problem and is garnering attention among consumers whose health could be put at risk.Recent estimates put the cost of food fraud at around US$40 billion worldwide, according to research from Michigan State University. It includes everything from mislabelling the country of origin or using “organic” labels when the item is not organic, to changing expiry dates, counterfeiting products, and adulterating or substituting ingredients.“A good fraudster is someone who technically hides very well his game,” said Samuel Godefroy, a leading expert in food risk analysis at Laval University. “We’re not supposed to discover the issue, but when it turns badly and when the fraud is done by people that have no scruples in what they are doing, it can even lead to tragic consequences.”A case in point, he said, was the 2008 Chinese milk scandal where 300,000 people were made ill when melamine, a chemical used to produce plastic, was added to milk powder. The powder caused the deaths of four children.Godefroy, who was a keynote speaker at an international food fraud conference held in Quebec City last week, noted that the food supply chain is becoming increasingly complex in today’s globalized world, with many middlemen and handlers from farm to plate. And countries like Canada and the United States need to step up measures to become more proactive rather than reactive, he said.“An important measure is beefing up traceability measures. Food ingredients are sourced from all over the planet but that doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be the right traceability to prevent food fraud from occurring.”Food ingredients are sourced from all over the planet but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be the right traceability to prevent food fraud from occurring. — Samuel Godefroy, Laval UniversityGodefroy said the conference was a great opportunity for academics, government regulators, and industry to get together to increase focus on preventative measures.Instead of reactive measures such as fines for fraudsters, he said there needs to be more resources for random checks of food samples to test food items such as olive oil, honey, and maple syrup, which have all been found to be adulterated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). They are among the 70 cases of food suppliers’ non-compliance with labelling laws on average per year in the last five years in Canada, which the agency publishes on its website. That number is low, however, compared to how widespread food fraud is.Seafood substitution and mislabelling is common in many countries, including Canada and the United States. In Canada, a CBC Marketplace study found that 34 of 153 fish samples from grocery stores were mislabelled. Seafood substitution occurs when a lower-priced fish is labelled as a higher priced fish in order to sell the lower-priced fish for more.New Technologies HelpingLeading food fraud experts and regulators are turning to new technologies to also combat food fraud. Blockchain technology is being applied to improve traceability and avoid counterfeiting food items. In Canada, Walmart and Loblaws are already putting such technology to use.According to the CFIA, Canada is the world leader in DNA barcoding technology, which can be used to identify food fraud by testing exactly the makeup of the food item on a molecular level, whether it is organic, and its geographical origin.Currently the DNA analysis technology is slow and costly, but according to Sylvain Charlebois, a leading researcher of food fraud at Dalhousie University, in the future Canadians could have access to affordable hand-held DNA analysis devices the size of smartphones to detect food fraud in the supermarket or at home.“I think essentially you’re dealing with the future of food.” Charlebois said. “If you don’t have trust from the consumers, it becomes very difficult to add any value and grow the food business.”Charlebois noted the University of Guelph is teaming up with the CFIA to work on making the DNA analysis technology more simple and cost-effective and eventually accessible to the public.And this is important, he added, considering 63 percent of Canadians are worried the foods they’re buying are not what the labels are claiming, especially those with health conditions, according to an online survey conducted by a research team he led at Dalhousie.Charlebois said that in developed countries like Canada, the food fraud that took place in Brazil—the largest exporter of meat products in the world—is less likely to happen because of the amount of corruption involved with Brazilian government regulators. He called it “one of the worst food fraud scandals in modern times.”In the scandal, cheaper animal parts were substituted for more expensive ingredients or products, with suspicious odours disguised by using acid. In addition, it is alleged that health inspectors allowed expired meat to be sold, turning a blind eye in exchange for bribes.But Charlebois added that more transparency within the CFIA would be helpful to inform the public more regarding its inspection process and results.The CFIA, which also took part in the global food fraud conference, said consumers are starting to ask more questions and become more aware of food fraud, which is an important tool in fighting it. But it’s such a widespread issue that all players, from industry to government to academia, have to work together to mitigate food fraud.“We have to remember the people conducting the fraud are interested in making money,” said Aline Dimitri, the CFIA’s deputy chief food safety officer.“But sometimes it’s in ways that we haven’t anticipated so it’s important to exchange information and make sure all the players in the system have open channels of communication in order to address this critical issue.”Jared Gnam is a freelance reporter based in Vancouver.

(Melanie Sun/The Epoch Times)By Keng Onn Wong12/21/2021Updated: 12/21/2021PrintSingapore authorities released 40-year-old Dickson Yeo after detaining him for close to a year for investigations. He was picked up when he arrived back in Singapore after serving a 14-month prison sentence in the United States for covertly collecting intelligence for the Chinese regime.On Dec. 14, Singapore’s Internal Security Department (ISD) announced in a press release it had completed its investigations into Singaporean Jun Wei Yeo, also known as Dickson Yeo.It established that Yeo “did not manage [to] obtain and pass on any classified information about Singapore to his foreign handlers.”“The threat that Yeo poses as a foreign agent is assessed to be effectively neutralized,” the ISD said.“As such, he does not pose a security threat that warrants continued detention.”Yeo was released through a “Suspension Direction” (SD) given by the Minister of Home Affairs, K. Shanmugam, which suspends the detention order made under Singapore’s Internal Security Act that is currently enforced on Yeo.While the detention order is still in force, if Yeo does not comply with any of the conditions of the SD, the minister may revoke it and have Yeo re-detained.Internal Security ActThe ISD arrested Yeo under the Internal Security Act (ISA) on Dec. 30, 2020, the day he arrived back in Singapore.In a statement made on the same day, the ISD said it would “interview Yeo to establish if he had engaged in activities prejudicial to Singapore’s security,” as Yeo had revealed to U.S. investigators his intelligence gathering included other countries aside from the United States.Under the ISA (pdf), a person can be detained without appearing in court for a period of up to two years, but it is used only “as a last resort” and for security threats such as “international terrorism, foreign subversion, espionage, and acts of violence or hatred using race.”In its statement announcing Yeo’s release, the ISD said its investigations had established that Yeo had knowingly and covertly worked for a foreign state to gather intelligence from 2016 to 2019.Yeo was first approached through an online professional network site. Then he was invited to an overseas academic symposium where he was requested to write reports for his handlers.He was paid “substantial amounts” for his reports, which were mainly on “global and regional geo-political issues and developments, including issues related to Singapore.”Yeo sought “privileged information” on those issues and approached people he thought had access to such information. He also set up a company and placed employment advertisements online. When asked, he said the reports were “research topics” for foreign clients.Yeo’s strategy was similar to what he did later in the United States, as previously reported by The Epoch Times.In addition, the ISD said: “On the direction of his handlers, Yeo had also applied for sensitive government positions in order to enrich his reports with privileged policy insights and classified information.“However, his attempts to secure employment in the public sector were unsuccessful.”Recruiting Spies Through Social MediaIn its statement, the ISD warned social media “has made it easier for foreign intelligence services to talent-spot, groom, and cultivate potential agents, even from abroad.”Likely targets are “retired/serving civil servants and individuals in the private sector with access to classified or sensitive information.”“Singaporeans must therefore remain vigilant to such dangers posed by foreign agents,” the ISD said.These agents may “offer attractive business or career opportunities, or even try to obtain sensitive information.”The “foreign state” mentioned in the ISD’s press release was not named.Yeo did not respond to The Epoch Times’s request for comments.

(Evan Vucci/AP Photo)By The Associated Press7/6/2022Updated: 7/6/2022PrintX 10:00WASHINGTON—President Joe Biden on Tuesday bestowed the nation’s highest military honor to four Army soldiers for heroism during the Vietnam War, bravery that he said had not diminished even with the passage of time.Biden presented the Medal of Honor to Staff Sgt. Edward N. Kaneshiro, Spc. Five Dwight W. Birdwell, Spc. Five Dennis M. Fujii, and retired Maj. John J. Duffy. Speaking at a ceremony in the White House East Room, Biden praised their heroism, noting that many like them don’t receive “the full recognition they deserve.”“Today, we’re setting the record straight. We’re upgrading the awards of four soldiers who performed acts of incredible heroism during the Vietnam conflict,” Biden said.“It’s just astounding when you hear what each of them have done,” he said. “They went far above and beyond the call of duty. It’s a phrase always used but ... it takes on life when you see these men.”Addressing the three living soldiers and relatives of Kaneshiro, who is deceased, the president said, “I’m proud to finally award our highest military recognition, the Medal of Honor, to each of you.”Biden noted that more than 50 years had passed “since the jungles of Vietnam where, as young men, these soldiers first proved their mettle. But time has not diminished their astonishing bravery, their selflessness in putting the lives of others ahead of their own, and the gratitude that we as a nation owe them.”President Joe Biden speaks during a Medal of Honor ceremony in the East Room of the White House on July 5, 2022. (Evan Vucci/AP Photo)Kaneshiro, killed in action by hostile gunfire in Vietnam in 1967, received his honor posthumously for a Dec. 1, 1966, raid where his unit came under fire by North Vietnamese troops. His actions were credited with helping his unit withdraw from the village where they were fighting. Kaneshiro was born and raised in Hawaii, a son of Japanese immigrants.Birdwell was honored for actions helping to head off an assault and evacuate wounded at Tan Son Nhut Airbase near Saigon on Jan. 31, 1968, despite injuries to his torso and face, during an opening salvo in what is known as the Tet Offensive, an especially bloody period of the war.Birdwell, a member of the Cherokee Nation and a lawyer in Oklahoma City, had received a Silver Star for his actions. Biden said it took Birdwell’s commanding officer decades to realize that Birdwell had not received the proper recognition and took steps, even in retirement, to “make this day possible.”“At long last, long last, your story is being honored as it should have been always,” Biden told Birdwell.Fujii received a Medal of Honor for actions over four days in February 1971 treating wounded and directing air strikes against enemy positions after his air ambulance was forced to crash land.Duffy was recognized for leading troops who came under ambush after their commander was killed in action, repelling attackers and evacuating wounded, despite his own injuries. Duffy went on to become an author and once was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for poetry.“He is the definition of a warrior poet,” Biden said.By Darlene Superville Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowThe Associated PressAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesWorld Shares Follow Wall Street Higher as Japan’s Nikkei Nears Record HighFeb 16, 2024Lyme Disease Case Counts in the US Rose by Almost 70 Percent in 2022 Due to a Change in How It’s ReportedFeb 15, 2024Power Outages Hit Boston Transit System During Morning Rush Hour, Stranding ThousandsFeb 15, 20242 Chinese Fishermen Drown After Chase With Taiwan’s Coast Guard, Which Alleges TrespassingFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsVietnam WarPulitzer PrizeJoe BidenMedal of HonorheroismCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

I know those young people yesterday were just trying to get good television and they did. But that doesn't mean I was most effective in answering it.— Bill ClintonThe former president is referring to a heated exchange that came up when protesters kept interrupting Clinton during his speech, protesting a 1994 crime bill that cracked down on gang crime.Clinton defended the bill and his wife, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, saying: “I don’t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack, and sent them out in the streets to murder other African-American children,” the former president said. “Maybe you thought they were good citizens—she didn’t.”READ MOREBill Clinton Spars With ‘Black Lives Matter’ ProtestersClinton continued, saying he was vigorously defending his wife, but upon reflection realized he was just talking past the protester: “I realized I was talking past her the way she was talking past me,” Clinton said of one of the female protesters. “I know those young people yesterday were just trying to get good television and they did. But that doesn’t mean I was most effective in answering it.”He also said in the speech that aspects of his 1994 crime bill “cannot be justified,” citing longer prison sentences imposed by the bill.

Today the typical candidate for BTHR is more likely to receive cementless implants. We present the experience of BTHR at our institution using cemented stems combined with cemented and uncemented sockets and, to our knowledge, the largest prospective single-centre series.Patients and methods:This cohort study reviews all patients (319 patients: 638 hips) having BTHR at our institution between December 1977 and December 2015. No case was lost to follow-up. Data were collected prospectively but reviewed retrospectively. Length of stay and complication rates were included, and data were compared with Hospital Episode Statistics figures for operations carried out between March 2005 and June 2014 to confirm local database validity. Patient experience and Oxford Hip Scores were obtained for a subgroup of this cohort, comparing them with patients who underwent bilateral staged operations performed within 1 year.Results:The rates for mortality, deep vein thrombosis, non-fatal myocardial infarction within 6 months were each 0.3% (1 episode) and non-fatal pulmonary embolism 0.6% (2 episodes). There were no intraoperative periprosthetic fractures or readmissions within 30 days.Conclusions:Our study shows a low risk of complications when using cemented and hybrid BTHRs for selected patients and the risk of complications compares favourably with published results. Available functional scores compared favourably to a comparison group of patients undergoing bilateral staged procedures, and a positive impression on treatment experience from a subgroup of interviewed BTHR patients was noticeable.Get full access to this articleView all access and purchase options for this article.Get AccessReferences1.

Falun Gong spokesperson Mr. Erping Zhang was interviewed and answered several questions about the announcement.Reporter: The Falun Dafa Association recently published an important announcement. Could you please tell our readers what its main contents are, what its purpose is, and why it was published at this time? Mr. Erping Zhang: As most people know, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been persecuting 100 million Falun Gong practitioners in China since the summer of 1999. According to the incomplete statistics of several human rights organizations, hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been imprisoned, thousands have been sent to psychiatric institutions, and 2,754 deaths due to torture have been verified. Many people were expelled from school, lost their jobs, suffered break-ups within the family, and were even forced to become homeless to avoid harassment, merely because they practiced Falun Gong. Jiang Zemin and his followers, who used the government's media monopoly and propaganda organs both in China and abroad in order to eliminate Falun Gong physically as well as to defame the reputation of the practice, instigated this shocking genocide. Such a persecution is unprecedented in terms of its size and cruelty. Facing such persecution, Falun Gong practitioners have held firmly to Falun Gong's core principles of “Truth, Compassion and Forbearance,” and they have clarified the truth peacefully all over the world; these benevolent and steadfast acts have won sympathy and support from many people both inside China and elsewhere.Concurrently, Falun Gong practitioners have successfully and effectively filed civil and criminal lawsuits against many of the key figures involved in the persecution, with the result that Jiang Zemin and other perpetrators are facing court cases in many countries. “Good deeds will result in good consequences and bad deeds will receive retribution” is truly the guiding rule of the world. So at this critical moment when the CCP is collapsing, the Falun Dafa Association has provided the CCP and its officials with one more chance, hoping that they will immediately stop the persecution of Falun Gong. If they have committed crimes against Falun Gong and now want to make amends, they can submit a letter of repentance, and/or a guarantee statement that they will no longer persist in their misdeeds, to Minghui Net (English version is Clearwisdom.net) or to any regional Falun Dafa Association to be archived. We will not investigate the various crimes of those who are determined to correct their mistakes, but we will continue to monitor their actions. As a matter of fact, there are many people of conscience in all levels of the Chinese government who are against this persecution, and they have been resisting the maltreatment of Falun Gong in different ways.Reporter: Last year's publication of “Nine Commentaries on the Chinese Communist Party” by The Epoch Times started the trend of withdrawing from the CCP and its related organizations. There are currently over 5 million people who have resigned from the Party. Would you like to comment on this?Mr. Zhang: The “Nine Commentaries” exposed the CCP's vile nature and bloody history. The voluntary withdrawal of so many people, even while the CCP is still in power, is unprecedented in the history of the Communist movement. This indicates that the CCP has lost the loyalty of the Chinese people and it is only a matter of time until the CCP collapses.Falun Gong has upheld its principle of not getting involved in politics and we use peaceful means that rely on “Truth, Compassion and Forbearance” to oppose the persecution. The Falun Gong teachings and exercises provide a way of cultivation, helping people to improve both spiritually and physically, and to return to their true selves, which are kind and considerate. Falun Gong could bring goodness to the people of any country, anywhere. Reporter: News reports have stated that since Falun Gong sued many high-level officials of the CCP, others who have committed crimes in the persecution are afraid to travel abroad. Would you please tell us more about this and also about your future plans?Mr. Zhang: It is true that several of those who committed wrongdoings in the persecution received monetary and political incentives to participate and also planned to move abroad at the earliest opportunity. However, such wrongdoings will not be considered legal by international law and will be tried and judged accordingly in the law courts of various countries. Furthermore, after the CCP collapses in the near future, the Chinese people will bring the officials who persecuted their own people to trial. There is an international organization that specializes in investigating the leaders and others who persecute Falun Gong. The lawsuits against the Minister of Information Industry, Wang Xudong, Minister of Commerce, Bo Xilai, former CCP Beijing City Secretary, Jia Qinglin, CCP Anhui Province Secretary, Wang Tuihua, Dalian Mayor, Xia Deren, CCP Beijing City Secretary, Liu Qi, and Guandong Province Governor, Huang Huahua, all indicated our determination to investigate and pursue any and all criminals involved in the persecution of Falun Gong, until the day justice is achieved.Reporter: It was recently reported that a scramble for power inside the CCP has been escalating; Jiang's followers, Zeng Qinghong and Luo Gan, intensified the persecution of Falun Gong in order to force Hu Jintao to be complicit in such an illegal act. Can you comment on this?Mr. Zhang: Most of the people in China under the CCP's control are against the persecution; so the party is facing a critical impasse. We observed that in the past two years under the leadership of Hu and Wen, Zeng Qinghong and Luo Gan did not stop the persecution, but rather intensified it behind the scenes. Their goal was to drag Hu and Wen into participating in the persecution. We believe that morality in China is deteriorating and that the CCP faces collapse and will have no future. We hope that Hu and Wen make good use of the limited time remaining to stop the persecution for the good of the nation. The final judgment of Jiang's regime and his followers is just around the corner.

But according to OCD UK, around 750,000 people in the UK are thought to be living with severe, debilitating obsessive compulsive disorder - a mental health condition in which a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours. Last updated by Lydia Smith Peer reviewed by Dr Krishna Vakharia Last updated 30 Aug 2023 5 mins readSara McQueen, 24, was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder - a severe form of premenstrual syndrome also known as PMDD -earlier this year.""My brain hung on to things - litter in the road, strangers sneezing too close on public transport. It's like the brain can't let anything go. It compulsively taunts itself with awful thoughts,"" she says.""It's a little like I'm searching for things which align perfectly with standards that I don't have. I stopped eating because I could never find the 'right' food. I didn't want to leave the house in case I saw something I didn't like to see, and those things ranged from anything from crying children to dirty light switches.""McQueen says she has become suicidal in the past and turned to alcohol. ""I was hungry, thirsty but unable to sort out those things because the OCD told me that the food would turn to dirt in my mouth, that the water was rancid and that if I left my room to go to the bathroom, I would never be able to get back in again,"" she says.OCD also caused her to pick at her skin. ""I search for marks, spots, hairs, anything that I can remove, and cause a lot of damage to my skin,"" she says. Sara is now taking medication and having therapy.What is OCD?Craig Shirley, a therapist and co-founder of the OCD Treatment Centre, says OCD often means experiencing severe anxiety around the things that we care about.""This often leads the person to become afraid of their thoughts, or environmental triggers that make them feel anxious. They then perform behaviours known as rituals to control their anxious symptoms, which in turn only serves to give more meaning and importance to the thoughts,"" he adds.""The person then gets more intrusive thoughts and increasingly feels the need to switch these feelings off more often, which eventually can become a debilitating cycle of thoughts, feelings and behaviours.""Unlike those who don’t suffer from OCD - who have thoughts they can ignore - someone with the condition will focus on the thought and begin to perform rituals to ensure the thought doesn’t come true, Shirley explains.OCD goes far beyond the common perception of handwashing - and it can be extremely debilitating and disrupt all aspects of someone's life, from work to friendships and relationships. Simple tasks such as eating, cooking, washing or taking the rubbish out can become impossible.""Also, OCD can leave people feeling depressed as well as having low self-esteem, in which case these can also be factors for a person struggling to have a normal lifestyle,"" Shirley says.

Although we may occasionally have intrusive thoughts, have feelings of anxiety or be superstitious, it is not the same as having the condition.Carrie Wheeler, 40, has OCD as well as other mental health conditions and multiple sclerosis. She says another misconception is that people with OCD are only obsessive regarding cleaning, but the condition can actually manifest in many different ways.""I think the biggest misconception I know of is that all people with OCD are clean freaks. We do not all furiously clean our house or have an extreme fear of germs and wash our hands continuously,"" she says.For Wheeler, OCD affects her home life and the way she eats, as her food must be prepared in a certain order. ""If I lose something, I spend hours looking for it, staying awake until I find whatever it is - often keeping my husband awake while looking around in my bedroom for what it is,"" she says.Whether someone develops OCD depends on a number of factors, including personality, genetics or life events. Although it is a long term (chronic) and debilitating condition, many people overcome OCD with treatment and support - or are able to reduce the impact it has on their lives.How to treat or manage OCDTherapy""There are many ways that a person can get treatment for OCD,"" Shirley says. ""The most common would be to visit your GP in order to explain your symptoms, before being referred to a specialist service such as a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) therapist.""With talking therapy, such as CBT, a person with OCD can learn to manage symptoms to regain an improved quality of life.Shirley says CBT can be successful in the treatment of OCD, but other anxiety management tools can help alongside the therapy: ""Often other principles, such as mindfulness and awareness of thoughts, education around the condition and the brain’s role in it, as well as a well-constructed relapse prevention programme for the person to follow once they finish therapy.""A therapy called exposure and response prevention can also be included as a part of CBT. This involves encouraging someone to face their fears and let obsessive thoughts happen without following them up with compulsions to 'fix' them.MedicationYour doctor or a specialist may recommend taking certain medication, as well as therapy.SupportGetting advice, information and support from organisations which specialise in OCD can help you understand more about the condition and how it can be treated, such as the charity OCD-UK. They can also help prevent isolation and offer a chance to socialise with others.""Other options include contacting OCD Action or Mind, two very good mental health charities who can help to put you in the right direction,"" says Shirley.""It also helps to seek out a therapist who has had experience of treating the condition or who has experienced it themselves, as we find that many of our clients explain that this makes a big difference and helps them to feel understood whilst recovering from the condition.""Further readingOCD UK: Occurrences of OCD.Read nextWhat you need to know about intrusive thoughts and OCD Coping with OCD as lockdown easesAre you protected against flu?See if you are eligible for a free NHS flu jab today.Check nowJoin our weekly wellness digestfrom the best health experts in the businessEnter your email Join now Please enter a valid email address.

(Saurabh Das/AFP/Getty Images)By Venus Upadhayaya12/17/2013Updated: 12/17/2013PrintStruggling through the withdrawal of most NATO forces, the upcoming presidential elections in April 2014, and lingering economic instability, Afghanistan now looks toward India for enhanced multidimensional cooperation.Afghan President Hamid Karzai, during his four-day work visit to India from December 12–15, met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid, and other Indian officials to discuss ways to enhance bilateral relations and cooperation in trade, defense, and security.According to a joint press release, the two countries agreed on deepening defense and security cooperation, through enhancement in training and meeting the equipment and infrastructure needs of Afghanistan National Security and Defense Forces that would increase their operational capabilities and mobility. The two leaders also agreed to expand opportunities for higher military education in India for Afghan officers.A report by Press Trust of India (PTI) highlights that Karzai asked India for stepping up military aid, including lethal and non-lethal weapons. There are indications that the Indian government is not averse to Karzai’s demands. Officials of Indian External affairs Ministry said the demands are being considered as they need to consider many factors like surpluses and licensing from other countries.Meanwhile, analysts are of the view that this cooperation is to address India’s own security concerns. Manoj Rai, the director of the Society for Participatory Research in Asia said, “There seems to great uncertainty around post-2014 Afghanistan scenario after withdrawal of NATO forces in 2014.”“The delay in the signing of the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) between the U.S. and Afghanistan, coupled with Obama’s zero-option dictate has further deepened suspense on the future of Afghanistan’s security, democracy, and development. Whatever it may be, uncertainty and/or suspense, Indian policy makers and international strategists know it well that India’s own security concerns are bound to rise,” Rai said.While the security scenario bothers both countries, Afghanistan is also gravely concerned by the impact of the lurking instability on its economy.Mirweis Azizi, an economist from Kandhar who has worked with various international NGOs in Afghanistan said, “There is already a decline in Afghan business by six positions from last year’s business ranking, and the situation is likely to worsen after NATO withdraws and instability increases.” He said that the Afghan common man wants that India must support Afghanistan in trade and creating employment in the country.Azizi, who is a part of the local youth movement called “Afghanistan Forward,” said that according to the World Bank’s 2012 report, no concrete plans have been formulated for the economic stability of the country yet, which Afghanistan ranks at 160th out of 183 economies for the ease of doing business. “This situation is likely to worsen after the withdrawal on account of instability,” he said.Since the war-torn country is going for presidential elections next year, the concerns have become graver as Karzai has already served for two maximum terms. Azizi said there are at least six serious candidates with a chance of winning. “Whoever wins, will face the acute problem of development of the country as whole and guarding against the utilization of country’s natural resources, while simultaneously ensuring that corruption, factional conflict, and imbalance is curtailed.”Rai points out that incidentally as Afghanistan moves into the presidential elections, India will be facing national general elections for a new government in New Delhi next year; but so far India’s responses to future possibilities in Afghanistan have been business as usual. However, Rai said that NATO withdrawal, fear of Afghan’s turbulent next year’s elections, and the political developments in Maldives, Bangladesh and Nepal coupled with “not so positive so far” responses from new Pakistan government can put India in a difficult situation.According to Rai, India should help Afghanistan in conducting free and fair elections. “Make investment in deepening democracy there specially strengthening local government there—a pact was signed between 2 governments in this regard but unfortunately not realized,” he said.While Azizi believes that India should build up ways for mutual trade and provide free route to Afghanis for health care. He said that Afghan people hope that the relation between Pakistan and India improve soon so Pakistan stops interference in Afghanistan internal matters and becomes less skeptic about Afghanistan-India strong brotherhood relationship.Furthermore, Aziz stressed that Afghan Youth needs the greatest support and attention, as more than 65 percent of Afghan’s population is youth, it’s future. “If tomorrow we have strong educated people in power, it will automatically give us a strong nation, and a strong nation is in the benefits of all countries in Asia and for the whole world,” he said.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) announced on Tuesday evening a plan for the federal government to buy troubled mortgages and refinance them at lower interest rates for homeowners.Friends Read FreeBy Frank Yu10/8/2008Updated: 5/26/2010PrintRepublican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) announced on Tuesday evening a plan for the federal government to buy troubled mortgages and refinance them at lower interest rates for homeowners.McCain proposed the Homeownership Resurgence Plan during the presidential debate, which gives the federal government power to purchase $300 billion worth of troubled mortgages.Eligible homeowners must already be in default—or close to being in default—to qualify for refinancing. They must also currently live in the home, and demonstrate an ability to pay, in the form of credit rating and proof of income, at the time of purchase. The government would purchase such failed mortgages and convert them into Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured loans. Under the initiative, homeowners would be able to renegotiate their mortgage rates to around 5 percent. Sen. McCain said in Tuesday night’s debate, “I would order the Secretary of Treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes, at the diminished values of those homes, and let people make those—be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.”Analyzing the PlanUnder Sen. McCain’s proposal, a mortgage would be refinanced down to 100 percent of the home’s current value. Homeowners will make payments based on the terms of the new mortgage contract, which is guaranteed by the U.S. government.Hope for Homeowners, a housing rescue bill passed in July, calls for mortgage lenders to write down mortgages to 90 percent of current home values. In that plan, lenders would take the loss between the current home value and its original mortgage balance. McCain’s proposal would essentially shift the risk of loss to the U.S. government—and ultimately, taxpayers—by having the FHA buy the mortgage loans from the lenders.The Obama Campaign responded in a statement: “John McCain wants the government to massively overpay for mortgages in a plan that would guarantee taxpayers lose money, and put them at risk of losing even more if home values don’t recover.” Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowFrank YuAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesChina Wrestles With Runaway Commodity PricesMay 22, 2021Telegram’s $1.7 Billion Token Sale Dwarfs Year’s Biggest Tech IPOApr 13, 2018The Marketing Corner: Social Media PracticesJan 29, 2017Tackling the NFL on Taxes Dec 30, 2013Related TopicsMcCaintreasuryCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

She recounted tearing up when volunteer Jamil Tucker gave each man a tie. The men then taught the kids how to tie a tie.“I started crying behind my camera,” she recalled. “The back of my camera was fogging up.”“This turnout is a testament to show [what happens] when a school and a community come together,” Principal Tracie Washington told the Dallas News.Kristina Dove, who helped organize the event, posted on Facebook that she was inspired by what unfolded.“All honor goes to those 600 men who showed up on that day to give America and the world hope for the future,” she wrote. “It’s because of your time, service and intentionality that we have been able to shine an international spotlight on the goodness and care for others that the majority of mankind possesses.”People responding to her post also praised the men, and Dove for her help in organizing the breakfast.“This gives me hope we are going to have a very good year! Thank you from a little girl who didn’t grow up with her dad. I was lucky enough to find him in my 40’s, so I have the perspective to have this story imprint onto my heart,” one Facebook user wrote.Recommended Video:Dishwasher Ensures 500 Foster Kids Have Toys for ChristmasFrom NTD.tv Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowZachary StieberAuthor (Reporter)FollowZachary Stieber is a senior reporter for The Epoch Times based in Maryland.

He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to Escondido police.Mr. Romero was arrested a few days later.A motive for the killing was not disclosed, but at Mr. Romero’s arraignment in late 2020, a prosecutor alleged the men had a dispute over property that was left behind at the residence.Related Stories8 US Marines Remain in a Hospital After a Fiery Aircraft Crash Killed 3 During Drills in Australia8/28/2023Woman, 22, Electrocuted After Car Crashes Into Electrical Box in San Diego8/26/2023 Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowCity News ServiceAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesSmall Plane Crashes at John Wayne Airport, 2 InjuredFeb 11, 2024Academy Announces New Oscar Category for Film CastingFeb 11, 20244 Suspects Arrested in Burglary of Marijuana DispensaryFeb 11, 2024UCLA Alum to Start at Center for 49ers in Super Bowl LVIIIFeb 11, 2024Related TopicsSan DiegoEscondidoCalifornia crimeCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

The star represents the earthquake's epicenter. (USGS)By Melanie Sun12/6/2017Updated: 12/7/2017PrintA 4.0 magnitude earthquake was felt across many areas of San Diego County on Wednesday, Dec. 6, at 4:33 p.m.The epicentre of the earthquake was 10 miles deep in the San Felipe Hills – about 8 miles northeast of Julian, California, which is just more than an hour’s drive from downtown San Diego.There was a preliminary magnitude 2.6 quake at 4:29 p.m, which was followed by the 4.0 quake, which was downgraded from a 4.2 by the USGS.At 4:38 p.m., the USGS registered another 3.1 aftershock in the same location.According to the USGS, the rumblings were felt in Julian, Warner Springs, Del Mar, Poway, Alpine, La Jolla, Ramona, Escondido, and El Cajon.“This was probably on the Earthquake Valley fault, which is a parallel strand to the Elsinore system,” Tom Rockwell, a seismologist at San Diego State University, told The San Diego Union-Tribune. “ It has about the same slip rate as the Elsinore,” Rockwell said.“It can produce large earthquakes, and might have produced the historical 1890 earthquake, which was 6.3 or close to that.”The Earthquake Valley fault is one of the most active fault lines in Southern California.Kerri Uglik, a clerk at the Julian Cider Mill in Julian, said the tremors nudged a small jar of mustard off a shelf in the shop but otherwise, there were no big disturbances, reported the Times of San Diego. There were no reports of structural damage or injuries.Think your friends may not know about this?

(Minh Hoang/Pool via Reuters/File Photo)By Reuters9/21/2018Updated: 12/3/2018PrintHANOI—Vietnam’s President Tran Dai Quang, a former chief of internal security who became one of the most high-profile leaders in the communist-ruled country, died on Sept. 21, after an illness, state media said.Quang’s rise, at a time of growing dissent on social media and challenges to the party’s authority, signaled limits to Vietnam’s liberal agenda, despite a growing openness to social change and sweeping economic reform, experts say.Quang, 61, died in a military hospital in Hanoi of a “serious illness despite efforts by domestic and international doctors and professors,” Vietnam Television said.He had hosted a reception for China’s Supreme Court chief on Sept. 19, state-owned newspaper Vietnam News said.Quang had been ill for months, said former health minister Nguyen Quoc Trieu, who now oversees healthcare for high-ranking officials.“He began showing symptoms of illness in June last year and has been treated in Japan six times since,” Trieu told Reuters.“He suffered from a kind of highly virulent virus, for which there has not been any efficient treatment.”Vietnam has no paramount ruler and is officially led by four “pillars”: its president, prime minister, the chief of its Communist Party and the national assembly chair.Myanmar's State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi (L) meets Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang at the Presidential Palace during the World Economic Forum on ASEAN in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Sept. 13, 2018. (Kham/Pool/Reuters)The president has a more ceremonial role, although he sits on the powerful decision-making politburo.Before his April 2016 appointment as president, Quang had been minister of public security, heading an organization with broad powers responsible for intelligence gathering and thwarting domestic and foreign threats to the party.Illness RumorsPosts about the death of Quang, once tipped by some analysts as a potential general secretary, spread quickly on Facebook before state media took the rare step of announcing it within two hours of the event.Rumors of his illness had circulated on social media for months, and there was no significant reaction in Vietnam’s benchmark index.At one of Quang’s last appearances, during a visit to Hanoi by Indonesian President Joko Widodo on September 11, the president appeared visibly unwell and stumbled as he stepped on to a platform to inspect a guard of honor.Quang hailed from a small farming community 115 km (70 miles) south of Hanoi, rising through party ranks to become a police general and Politburo member.Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) shakes hands with Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang (R) at the Presidential Palace in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Nov. 13, 2017. (Luong Thai Linh/Pool/Fuile Photo/Reuters)“We are saddened to hear the news that the president has died,” said Bui Duc Phi, council chairman of the village where he was born.Vietnam’s constitution provides for the vice president to perform the president’s duties should he be unable to work.“Vice president Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh will handle his duties until the National Assembly elects a new president,” said prominent lawyer Tran Vu Hai.The national assembly is set to meet in late October, but the date could be brought forward, he added.By Khanh Vu and James Pearson Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowReutersAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesDollar on Track for 5th Straight Weekly Gain, Yen FragileFeb 16, 2024Oil Slips as Weaker IEA Demand Outlook Offsets Rate Cut HopesFeb 16, 20242 Fans Came to See Kansas City Chiefs; They Stopped Suspected ShooterFeb 15, 2024Wall Street Opens Flat After Mixed Economic DataFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

(CSABA SEGESVARI/AFP/Getty Images)By The Associated Press9/7/2015Updated: 9/7/2015PrintROSZKE, Hungary— Several hundred Arabs, Asians and Africans tired of waiting for buses broke through Hungarian police lines near the Serbian border Monday and marched north on the main highway to Budapest as authorities once again demonstrated an inability to control the human tide passing through Hungary.Police repeatedly tried to form lines blocking roadways around a migrant holding center near the border village of Roszke, but the asylum seekers vastly outnumbered police and were easily able to outflank the lines of officers, jogging through farm fields to reach the M5 motorway linking Hungary to Serbia.Traffic was halted in both directions as backpack-clad asylum seekers walked briskly on the edge of the highway, groups of police walking alongside them but not trying to stop them. A lone police helicopter monitored their progress at sunset.As the lead marchers passed media filming their progress from a highway overpass, dozens raised their arms in celebration and chanted “Germany! Germany!”A migrant family is pushed down from the road by police on the M5 highway near Roszke village at the Hungarian-Serbian border on September 7, 2015. (AFP PHOTO / CSABA SEGESVARI)The move mirrored last week’s surge of migrants west from the capital, Budapest, toward Austria in mass protests that forced Hungarian authorities to relent on security grounds and move thousands in a fleet of buses to the Austrian border. Hungary also has stopped checking foreigners for travel visas at train stations, making it easier for the newcomers to leave Hungary for the wealthier West, particularly Germany.Monday’s renewed trouble underscored the growing sense across the continent that the 28-nation European Union must reach a continent-wide agreement on sharing responsibility for sheltering more of the estimated 340,000 asylum seekers who have arrived in the 28-nation bloc already this year.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, reflecting on “a moving, in some parts breathtaking weekend behind us,” said all EU countries should help to accommodate those trying find a refuge from war in Europe.Further south on the migrants' epic, meandering path to Germany, the situation remained fraught with fear and anger.French President Francois Hollande announced his country would welcome 24,000 refugees, while he and Merkel had agreed on a formula for spreading the migrant load across Europe.But Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, said he wasn’t prepared to pitch in and questioned how any EU quota system based on current figures could resolve the real issue of unrelenting immigration.Even as calm returned Monday to the main Austria-Hungary border crossing where more than 15,000 people crossed over the weekend en route to Germany, Hungary’s leader hit back at European partners who blamed his country for stoking the chaos.READ MOREMerkel Demands EU Partners Share Burden of Migrant InfluxMerkel told reporters in Berlin that Germany would ensure that those who need protection receive it, but those who stand no chance of getting asylum would be swiftly returned to their homelands. Germany is preparing to receive by far the largest number of immigrants, an estimated 800,000 by the end of the year, and Merkel said other EU nations should take some.Outside the EU, British Prime Minister David Cameron said the U.K. will resettle up to 20,000 Syrians from camps in Turkey, Jordan and Syria over the next five years. Announcing the vast expansion of Britain’s refugee program, he told Parliament that Britain has a moral responsibility to act. Cameron said vulnerable children and orphans would be given priority.Orban mocked the European Union’s efforts to distribute migrants through a quota system and compared Hungary to a “black sheep” representing a voice of reason in the EU flock.He said Europe first must focus on security measures designed to force travelers from troubled lands to seek asylum in neighboring countries, not travel thousands of miles (kilometers) into the heart of Europe. He said the current discussions on a new quota to handle 120,000 migrants soon would lead to discussions on hosting millions more.“We represent the position of what the Americans call ‘first things first,’” Orban told Hungarian ambassadors meeting in Budapest. “As long as we are unable to defend Europe’s external borders, it makes no sense to talk about the fate of the immigrants.”In a related development, Hungarian Defense Minister Csaba Hende resigned Monday. The statement from Orban’s government didn’t explicitly blame him for Hungary’s failure to complete the building of a fence along Hungary’s 175-kilometer (110-mile) border with Serbia, but it was supposed to be completed last month and remains largely unfinished.Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann and other EU leaders have blamed Orban for bungling Hungary’s intake of migrants so badly that it left Austria and Germany no choice but to open their borders Saturday to thousands who had complained of neglect and human rights violations in Hungary and refused to stay in refugee camps there.Migrants who have just crossed into Hungary wait for buses to take them to a reception camp on September 7, 2015 in Roszke, Hungary. As the migrant crisis in Europe continues, an estimated 18000 people arrived in Germany over the weekend with thousands more following in their wake along the Balkan route. (Matt Cardy/Getty Images)Hans Peter Doskozil, police chief of Burgenland in eastern Austria, said more than 15,000 people crossed from Hungary by foot, bus, train and car over the weekend. Austria ordinarily would require all asylum seekers to register there, but in an exceptional gesture permitted all to travel onward chiefly by train to Germany, their overwhelming destination of choice.Austria said Monday it intended to stop providing special trains for more migrant loads because of dissipating demand.“The situation is under control,” Austrian Railways spokesman Michael Braun said after three special trains for migrants left Vienna’s Westbahnhof for the southern German city of Munich earlier Monday.But further south on the migrants’ epic, meandering path to Germany, the situation remained fraught with fear and anger.Police near Hungary’s southern border with non-EU member Serbia tried to block hundreds of new arrivals from walking out of a field that serves as the first holding center for migrants walking across the border through a police-supervised hole in its border razor-wire defenses.READ MOREMigrants in the Balkans: Everyone Wants to Be SyrianTempers flared as the people, chiefly identifying themselves as Syrian, demanded to be allowed to walk away rather than wait hours for infrequent bus service that would take them to a nearby Hungarian registration camp. Police, some donning surgical masks and gloves in fear that the foreigners might have infectious diseases, pushed them back to the side of the road and insisted they must wait for buses.But the migrant numbers soon overwhelmed police, who could not stop the foreigners from reaching the M5 motorway linking the Serbian capital, Belgrade, to Budapest some 175 kilometers (110 miles) to the north.Soon, as happened Friday when thousands walked west from Budapest on the M1 motorway, hundreds were walking along the side of the two-lane road while police were reduced to blocking traffic and walking alongside the migrants.Near the village of Idomeni on Greece’s northern border with Macedonia, scuffles broke out early Monday between police and people waiting to cross, as the crowd grew to nearly 2,000. Tensions eased after authorities, who had been allowing only small groups to cross every half hour, began moving people more quickly. Eventually the crowd thinned, with an estimated 1,000 crossing by midday.Macedonian policemen scuffle with refugees and migrants as they wait to pass the borders from the northern Greek village of Idomeni, to southern Macedonia, Monday, Sept. 7, 2015. (AP Photo/Giannis Papanikos)Greece’s migration minister, Yiannis Mouzalas, estimated that at least two thirds of the more than 15,000 travelers stranded on the eastern Aegean island of Lesbos would be ferried to mainland Greece in the next five days. Lesbos bears the brunt of the refugee influx from nearby Turkey, with more than 1,000 arriving daily on small boats in often dangerous conditions.In a late-night meeting that lasted until early Monday in Berlin, the German government agreed to spend 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) next year to support asylum seekers. It also decided to make it easier to deport those from countries considered stable nations such as Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania.The government’s reformed aid package will include less cash in hand for asylum seekers but better non-cash benefits, including improved housing and language classes.Merkel’s deputy, Sigmar Gabriel, said integrating the migrants into society would require confronting the fears of native Germans.“I say this quite openly, there will be conflicts,” the economy minister told reporters. “The more openly we talk about the fact that people are worried, that there’s fear in the country and that there may be conflicts, will I think help us deal with this realistically and confront reality.”German media reported that five asylum seekers were injured in a fire Monday in Rottenburg in southwest Germany. Three were injured when they jumped from the burning house, while two others were treated for smoke inhalation.German officials specified no cause of the fire, though right-wing militants in Germany have set fire to other properties earmarked for asylum seekers in recent weeks.___Associated Press reporters Pablo Gorondi and Alexander Kuli in Budapest, Marko Drobnjakovic in Roszke, Hungary; Lori Hinnant in Paris, Kirsten Grieshaber and Frank Jordans in Berlin, Gregory Katz in London, George Jahn in Vienna and Giannis Papanikos in Idomeni, Greece, contributed to this report.

(Emmerson Resources)By Nina Nguyen2/11/2024Updated: 2/11/2024PrintX 10:00Australia will inject $399 million (US$260 million) into the development of next-generation drones in a bid to boost the country’s military aerospace capabilities.Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy on Feb. 9 announced extra funding for the autonomous Ghost Bat programme, which would secure more than 350 jobs across the nation and support the local defence industry.This is built on a preview investment of $600 million on the top secret drone project with eight aircrafts for prototype testing, bringing the total spend to almost $1 billion.The Ghost Bat is the first military aircraft to be designed, engineered, and manufactured in Australia in more than 50 years, Mr. Conroy said.“This … underscores the depth of innovation and expertise in our defence industry,” he said in a press release.“That’s why giving our Air Force the critical capabilities it needs to protect Australians and their interests is paramount.”Related StoriesAUKUS Scientists Test Autonomous Military Vehicles in South Australia2/9/2024Australia Joins US-Japan Military Exercise for the 1st Time2/4/2024The government said the new technology is designed to “act as a loyal wingman” that will protect and support Australia’s military assets and pilots. It would also undertake a wide range of activities across large distances, including performing combat roles.The funding boost is expected to enable a focus on developing sensor and mission payloads, an integrated combat system and autonomous systems.Mr. Conroy added that more than 200 Australian companies have already contributed to the MQ-28A program, including more than 50 small and medium enterprises within the supply chain.“This project demonstrates that with the appropriate support from government, Australia’s defence industry can continue to be a world leader and a key source of jobs,” he said.“The prosperity and security of our nation and will always be a top priority for the Albanese government. That’s why giving our Air Force the critical capabilities it needs to protect Australians, and their interests, is paramount.”The move came after the Albanese government agreed that it would collaborate with the United States on technology sharing.The next phase of the Ghost Bat program will aim to develop technology that will allow drones to work together and with other crewed aircraft, including the Super Hornet or Wedgetail, to complete missions as one team.Mr. Conroy said he expected the drones to be tested at a demonstration exercise next year.The Coalition threw support behind the move, with Opposition Leader Peter Dutton calling the investment “a great outcome.”“There’s not only sort of a domestic benefit but this will enhance our global reputation,” he told Nine’s Today.“It’s a great outcome and we support it very much.”Under an agreement with the U.S., technology will be shared between the two countries to help fast-track the aircraft’s manufacture.AAP contributed to this report.

(Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)By Katabella Roberts7/10/2020Updated: 7/10/2020PrintA Pennsylvania police officer who was seen on video kicking a protestor in Erie sitting on the street during clashes on May 30 will not face criminal charges, Erie County District Attorney Jack Daneri announced on Thursday.Speaking at a news conference, Daneri said the officer’s actions did not warrant prosecution. He added that the officer, who has not been identified by city officials, had the right to use that kind of force under the circumstances.The protestor, 21-year-old Hannah Silbaugh, will also not face charges from the incident.The altercation occurred shortly before midnight on May 30 amid nationwide demonstrations following the killing of George Floyd, an African-American man who died in police custody on May 25.Pennsylvania police said several hundred people descended on City Hall at night and began spray painting the building, breaking windows, pulling parking meters out of the ground, vandalizing shops and restaurants, and throwing objects at local police. Officers used tear gas as they tried to disperse the crowd.Video footage shared on Twitter shows the officer approaching Silbaugh as she sat on the ground in the middle of the street with her hands held against her face.The officer then aggressively kicked her in the chest and she falls over. Silbaugh filed an internal affairs complaint alleging that the officer assaulted her by kicking her.Daneri said that at the time Silbaugh was kicked, police and a law enforcement vehicle needed to get past a line of protesters to attend to more serious violence in the area.In a June 15 press conference, Erie Mayor Joe Schember said an investigation into the matter concluded that the officer followed approved procedures and his use of force was technically justified.Schember called the officer a veteran of the force “who has no prior complaints and has never exhibited any kind of behavior that warranted disciplinary action.”However, the mayor said the officer’s actions on this occasion did warrant action, and announced that he would be suspended for three days without pay and placed on desk duty until completing sensitivity training.The mayor also noted that similar training would be required for the entire police department.Daneri said the protesters could have been charged with failure to disperse, but his office declined to file those charges because of the facts and in the interest of moving forward.Silbaugh’s lawyer, Timothy McNair, has taken legal steps toward filing a lawsuit.With reporting from The Associated Press.

It is a diminutive of the name Adelheid, which is the German and Dutch form of the German name Adalheidis, meaning ‘noble birth’ or ‘nobility.’ It is also linked with other German names such as Heidemarie, Heidelinde, and Heidrun.According to legend, the Swiss people developed a liking for the name when Johanna Spyri, an author, released her novel “Heidi” between 1880 and 1881. The story features Heidi, an orphan who lives with her grandfather and enjoys various adventures in the Swiss Alps. She marvels at the vastness of the mountains and celebrates their serenity. Her actual name is Adelheid, but her aunt fondly calls her Heidi, which increases the name’s popularity.Since the name is associated with nobility, it can also be referred to as a virtue name, like Hope, Patience, Honor, and Grace. If you prefer a nickname for your little girl, refreshing versions of the name include Heid, Heidi-ho, Di, or Di di, and Dee. These names also embody the essence of Heidi and can instill a sense of nobility in your child’s character.Interestingly, Heide (a variant of the name used in Germany) is also the name of a town in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Additionally, a theme park in Lower Saxony, Germany, is named Heidi. Germans love to honor the name by keeping it alive in their naming traditions.Johanna Spyri’s novel sparked an interest in this unique name, and many writers have since taken a liking to it. In the popular teen book series by Stephenie Myers, Twilight, the Volturi have a vampire guard named Heidi, who is known for her ethereal beauty. Moreover, the main character in the 1980 film “The Competition,” played by award-winning American actress Amy Irving, is named Heidi Joan Schoonover.Given Heidi’s popularity, it may be one of the best names for your baby in modern times, connecting her with traditional roots.Heidi Meaning Noble birth; Nobility Gender Girl Religion Judaism Origin German Lucky Number 8 Syllables Two Length 1 word, 5 letters, 3 vowels, 2 consonants Type Short and easy to pronounce How To Pronounce Heidi?Pronounced as hei-deeThe way you pronounce a name can make all the difference.Listen to the sound of the name Heidi in German.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images) R: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) makes a statement about a coronavirus aid package, on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 13, 2020. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo)By Jack Phillips12/28/2020Updated: 12/28/2020PrintHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said President Donald Trump should call on GOP members of Congress to “immediately” stop an “obstruction” to the $2,000 stimulus payments he sought.Pelosi was reacting to Trump’s signing of the $900 billion stimulus package that was tied to a larger omnibus bill. The package authorized direct payments and checks for up to $600.“The signing of the bipartisan, bicameral coronavirus relief legislation is welcome news for the fourteen million Americans who just lost the lifeline of unemployment benefits on Christmas Weekend, and for the millions more struggling to stay afloat during this historic pandemic and economic crisis,” Pelosi wrote in a statement on her website.But Trump should “immediately call on Congressional Republicans to end their obstruction and to join him and Democrats in support of our stand-alone legislation to increase direct payment checks to $2,000,” the speaker added, remarking that the measure will be brought to the House floor on Monday.In her statement, Pelosi seemingly attempted to put pressure on Republicans ahead of the Jan. 5 runoff election in Georgia, where two Senate seats are up for grabs.“Every Republican vote against this bill is a vote to deny the financial hardship that families face and to deny the American people the relief they need,” she said.Some GOP legislators have expressed concerns about how the stimulus payments would be funded.“If we went to $2,000 per person, the additional borrowing would be up to almost $500 billion,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said, according to KUTV. “Someone’s got to pay for that. We can’t just have free money.”Romney qualified his remarks by saying that he opposes $600 payments as well.After Pelosi said she would call a House session to vote on $2,000 stimulus payments on Monday, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that Democrats are ignoring other concerns expressed by Trump. He pointed to Trump’s video last week where he said the stimulus bill contained too many unneeded provisions such as foreign aid programs.House Democrats “have conveniently ignored the concerns expressed by the president, and shared by our constituents, that we ought to reexamine how our tax dollars are spent overseas while so many of our neighbors at home are struggling to make ends meet,” McCarthy said in a statement last week.“Thus, Republicans will offer a unanimous consent request to revisit the state and foreign operations title of the omnibus so that we can fully address the concerns at hand. It will be up to Speaker Pelosi to decide if she wants to act on behalf of the American people,” he remarked.

Rumors of Duchess of Cambridge Going to Have Twins Likely a HoaxFriends Read FreePippa Middleton and Prince Harry will be an aunt an uncle, respectively, as Prince William and Kate have announced baby No. 2. This is a Thursday, Dec. 6, 2012 file photo of Britain's Prince William stand next to his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge as she leaves the King Edward VII hospital in central London. Jurors at Britain's phone hacking trial have heard transcripts Thursday Dec. 19, 2013 of intercepted messages left by Prince William on Kate Middleton's phone, in which he calls her ""babykins"" and jokes about almost being shot during a military training exercise. The messages from 2006 were found among the belongings of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who has been convicted of hacking the phones of aides to William and Prince Harry. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant, File)By Jack Phillips6/17/2014Updated: 7/18/2015PrintRumors saying Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, is pregnant are probably a just hoax.“Star” magazine claimed that Middleton was going to have two children.The U.K. monarchy has not issued a statement confirming that she’s pregnant, meaning the whole thing is probably a hoax.Star claimed that Middleton has already gathered up Prince George’s clothes to use for her new babies.To fuel the rumors even more, an unnamed source spoke with OK Magazine, saying “Kate has always wanted a daughter, and she’s talked about it so much that William did too. Kate’s upbringing with Pippa [Middleton] was idyllic and she always wanted to have girls of her own to carry on the legacy of strong, happy women. Plus, she thinks George having sisters will be tremendously good for his character.”Also, recent photos of Middleton show that she’s clearly not pregnant.And two weeks ago, she was spotted taking shots of whiskey with her husband Prince William, suggesting even more that’s she isn’t pregnant.The rumors appear to be perpetuated by a few tabloids and gossip rags. However, one website is claiming that Middleton herself is behind the rumors.As Celebrity Dirty Laundry notes, “Honestly, enough pregnancy rumours would probably do the trick as well, so don’t be surprised if we keep hearing about how Kate and Will are trying for another child right now, or are planning to announce another pregnancy over the summer. Baby watch is the best PR move there is, and celebrities prove that all the time.” THE ASSOCIATED PRESS UK update: Jury mulls verdicts at UK phone hacking trial LONDON (AP) — The jury at Britain’s phone hacking trial has retired to consider verdicts against seven defendants charged with wrongdoing at Rupert Murdoch’s British tabloids.The panel of eight women and three men will decide whether to convict or acquit ex-News of the World editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, and five others.The trial began in October and ran for 130 days. It was spawned by revelations that the tabloid had eavesdropped on the voicemails of celebrities, politicians and others.Judge John Saunders told jurors Wednesday they could take as long as they needed to reach verdicts.All seven defendants deny the charges, which include phone hacking, paying officials for information and obstructing a police investigation.The phone hacking scandal led Murdoch to shut down the 168-year-old tabloid in 2011.

(REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino)By Reuters5/8/2019Updated: 5/8/2019PrintVenezuelan interim president Juan Guaidó said on Wednesday that intelligence agents had detained his deputy, the first arrest of a lawmaker since Guaidó tried to spark a military uprising last week to bring down socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro’s regime.Edgar Zambrano, vice president of the nation’s duly elected National Assembly National Assembly, said on Twitter that agents from the SEBIN intelligence agency were using a tow truck to drag his vehicle, with him inside, to one of their Caracas bases.On Tuesday, the Venezuelan Constituent Assembly, which was called into existence by Maduro to rewrite the country’s 18-year-old constitution, ruled to strip Zambrano and six other lawmakers, of their parliamentary immunity to allow their future prosecution.The Supreme Court, which is criticized for being stacked with Maduro’s supporters, had earlier accused the lawmakers of conspiracy, rebellion, and treason, and on Wednesday accused three other pro-Guaidó legislators of the same crimes. The U.S. government this week threatened to sanction all Supreme Court members.Venezuela's Supreme Court President Maikel Moreno reads a statement in Caracas, Venezuela, on Jan. 22, 2018. (REUTERS/Marco Bello)Guaidó lead more mass protests last week, calling for the people of Venezuela to kick Maduro out and return the country to the people. The United States also announced more sanctions against the Maduro regime. Maduro decried the events as an attempted coup.“One of the principal conspirators of the coup has just been arrested,” Diosdado Cabello, head of Maduro’s Constituent Assembly, said in comments broadcast on state television. “They will have to pay before the courts for the failed coup that they attempted,” he said.Zambrano said on Twitter that SEBIN agents had surrounded his vehicle by the headquarters of his Democratic Action party in Caracas’ La Florida district.“We were surprised by the SEBIN, and after refusing to let us leave our vehicle, they used a tow truck to forcibly transfer us directly to the (SEBIN headquarters) Helicoide,” he said. It was not yet clear if Zambrano was already at the Helicoide.“The regime has kidnapped the first vice president,” Guaidó said on Twitter.Guaidó in January invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, denouncing Maduro as illegitimate after he secured re-election last year in a vote widely viewed as fraudulent. The Constituent Assembly removed Guaidó’s parliamentary immunity in early April, but authorities have not tried to arrest him since then.Earlier on Wednesday, the Supreme Court’s head, Maikel Moreno, rebuffed the U.S. government’s threats to sanction his court’s members if they did not reject Maduro’s government and Guaidó.The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions in 2017 on Moreno and the seven principal members of the court’s constitutional chamber for rulings that “usurped the authority” of the National Assembly.U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the Trump administration would soon sanction the 25 remaining members of the court. Pence said on Tuesday that the United States was lifting economic sanctions on a former Venezuelan general who turned against Maduro in order to encourage other Maduro allies to follow suit.

Our recent studies reveal a tangible link between the brain’s electrical activity and the heart’s rhythm, exemplifying the mind-body synergy. This chapter covers topics that Yoga integrates breath and posture to unify mind, body, and the environment; and furthermore, Zen/Chan meditation directly aims to dismantle all conceptual illusions, including those of self and universe, sharpening the practitioner’s mental acuity, and challenging their perception of reality. This chapter explores the mind-body nexus and contrasts various meditative disciplines, primarily focusing on the nuances between Yoga and Zen/Chan meditation.

Introduction1.1 The concept of mind-body unity in Yoga philosophyYoga originated in ancient India, and it is grounded in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali [1]. This holistic philosophy posits the unity of the body, mind, and spirit in humans. The practice of Yoga can lead to spiritual liberation or enlightenment, which is a pure state of consciousness and an Elysian spiritual state. A unity of the mind and body is emphasized in Yoga philosophy, extending to unity with other beings and our surroundings, and ultimately, a reunion of the self with the universe. The Yoga concept of Advaita, akin to nondualism, states that the true nature of the self mirrors the essence of the universe. However, due to avidya or ignorance, secular individuals harbor an illusion of separation between the self and others [2].The dispelling of this illusion or avidya can be achieved only through the practice of Yoga, which includes physical postures (asanas), breathing exercises (pranayama), meditation, and other spiritual practices [3, 4]. Why is spiritual liberation pursued through physical and breathing training, rather than philosophical thinking and logical deduction? This stems from the ancient law of cause and effect, which asserts that all substantive actions entail consequences [5], and physical action can have a more practical effect than pure philosophical thinking. Moreover, the physical state of the body is intertwined with, if not determinative of, the mental state [6, 7]. Therefore, the practice of Yoga seeks to purify the body and mind simultaneously, foster positive causal effects, and facilitate the attainment of greater physical happiness and spiritual growth.Once the physical aspect of the body is well-trained and largely purified, the focus of practice moves on to spiritual exercises and purification. The philosophy of Yoga places particular emphasis on moral behavior and character, referred to as yamas and niyamas. Yamas incorporate principles such as non-violence, sincerity, and non-theft, while niyamas include principles such as cleanliness, contentment, and self-discipline [8]. Adhering to these moral standards is an inevitable manifestation of their practical implementation in real life. If practitioners genuinely embrace Advaita’s “non-two” or “nondualism,” they recognize that the self and the universe are not independent entities but interdependent and unified. There is no need for deception or theft as these acts are inappropriate and unnecessary [9].Following the rule of causality, only the practice of Yoga with substantial action, including both the physical and mental training, can help us purify them as a unity. Training of either the body or the mind alone cannot overcome the illusion of dualistic separation. The combined physical and mental practice of Yoga helps the practitioner cultivate a sense of unity with all existence. Eventually, consciousness of the true nature of the self and the universe will appear and merge as the ultimate reality. This non-dualistic philosophy is closely related to the concept of Brahman as the source of existence and the cosmos. It is assumed that the true nature of the self is identical to the nature of Brahman. The ultimate goal of human existence is to realize this universal truth and achieve liberation and enlightenment [10].Over thousands of years of development, yoga training has formed an integrated system that includes body posture (asanas), breath control (pranayama), sensory withdrawal (pratyahara), focused attention(dharana), deep meditation (dhyana), the highest state of absorption or superconsciousness (samadhi). There is ethical guidance all through the Yoga practices. Yoga’s body movements are designed to balance different aspects of the practitioner’s physiology, promote physical health and vitality, and prepare for meditation. Breathing training plays a particularly important role in the systematic training of yoga, where the practice of breathing in and out harmonizes the flow of life force (prana), calms the mind, and regulates emotional states [11]. Both yoga and the modern fashionable mindfulness place a special emphasis on breathing [12, 13]. From a neuroscientific point of view, breathing training lies in the effectiveness of any mental training, especially with its profound physiological basis (Figure 1).Figure 1.The nervous control on respiratory activities.Breath training, or “pranayama,” as respiratory activity can act as a bridge, spanning the chasm between the conscious and unconscious realms, uniting them into a harmonious existence. The Sanskrit term “pranayama” combines “prana,” representing life energy or breath and “ayama,” denoting expansion or extension. Thus, pranayama encompasses the essence of breath control in yoga practice, serving as a critical element in yoga training. In yoga, conscious control of breathing can be considered a conduit, linking the conscious mind with physiological processes typically unconscious [14, 15]. This unique interaction can serve as a direct reminder of our innate ability to influence our physiological states through mindfulness observation. The continual inflow and outflow of breath provide a flexible and vivid phenomenon for observation, much like focused attention meditation, thereby helping to anchor our attention in the present moment and with our physical body [16, 17]. This focus on the breath can serve as a robust defense against the mental wandering or even storm in our brain that occasionally arises in our minds, granting us calmness. The relationship between physiological and psychological processes is characterized by distinct temporal dynamics. Cognitive functions generally operate at a more rapid pace compared to somatic responses, which are inherently slower and exhibit a finite range of adaptability. For instance, the human mind is capable of swiftly traversing a broad spectrum of thoughts and imaginings, often detaching from the present moment and engaging with abstract concepts or hypothetical scenarios. In contrast, the physical body is anchored here and now, constrained by the temporal and spatial limitations inherent to biological processes. By consciously coordinating breath and movement in yoga practice, we can gradually cultivate mind-body coherence. This resonance of physical and mental activities can guide the harmonious operation of our life energy, ultimately enabling our minds to become more focused, balanced, and harmonious [18].Conscious breathing training can eventually make the mind to be more coherent with the natural rhythm of the biological body. It harmonizes psychological and physiological activities and achieves a state of effortless mastery. Once the mind can freely collide with and utilize this primal force, the union of mind and body can bring forth enduring spiritual power. When breath and consciousness are in tune, we become aware of the natural flow of our inner life force and experience how subjective consciousness can influence the physical state [19]. This “homecoming” simulates the process of our spirit returning to its roots, where the mind can release deeper insights and peace. Therefore, breath training can provide us with a journey back home—through the mind returning to the origin of the breath, ultimately retrieving our original intention [20]. This “homecoming” journey is realized through mindfulness-style breath training, bringing tranquility, unity, and joy [20]. By continuously practicing mindful breathing in yoga and cultivation, we can explore the operation of life energy within the body and establish harmonious interaction between physiological structure and subjective conscious experience. Pranayama provides us with a path to our inner rhythm [21].Long-term practice of Pranayama and mindful breathing will increase the practitioner’s interoception on the subtle interpenetration and merge between the physiological and psychological structures of human beings [22]. During the process, breathing is the bridge that can connect the conscious mind with the unconscious body. They have different rhythms by nature. Thus, breath can connect the primary physiological force of life and voluntary psychological control. With continuous practice, the boundary between the mind and body will gradually dissolve and be replaced by a macroscopic sense of unity. By deepening this cross-boundary link, we can touch upon the deeper layers of the self and experience the possibility of the self-transcending the mundane. The mind-body bridge established through the practice of mindful breathing is a solid starting point for exploring the inner realm and many other yogic practices. It closely joins the consciousness with the life force, endowing us with a transcendent form of existence [23]. Through it, we can strengthen the growth of the wisdom within the living body, and through this wisdom, return to the embrace of the supreme source of existence. Advertisement 2. Brain-heart connection and neuroscienceMuch of yoga’s discourse has been fully described in other chapters of this book. This chapter will focus on the issue of mind-body unity based on the above discussion, especially from this novel perspective of modern neuroscience. The final part of the chapter will discuss other spiritual training, especially Zen Buddhism’s, and their implication for yoga training and philosophical elicitation in terms of spirituality and enlightenment.The interconnection between mind and body is a fundamental premise of various Eastern philosophies and practices, extending beyond yoga to include traditions such as Buddhism, qigong, tai chi, and traditional Chinese medicine. These systems all underline the inseparability of physical, mental, and spiritual wellness [24]. Till to date, these concepts largely resided within the realm of philosophical discourse and personal anecdote, lacking empirical validation. While practitioners and scholars spoke of the profound effects of these mind-body practices, objective evidence remain scarce. The emergence of modern neuroscience has started to shed light on the potential mechanisms underlying these age-old wisdom. With sophisticated tools to investigate brain processes and their relationships with bodily function, it is now possible to explore these concepts with scientific rigor [25].Mind-body problem is the hard problem for philosophers and scientists. Nonetheless, the complexity of mind-body relationship can be partially elucidated through the relationship between the brain and the heart. Mind can be best researched upon the brain’s responsibility. The heart, as a crucial organ, exemplifies the body’s dynamic nature. Cardiac rhythm and strength continually adjust in response to bodily demands, and cessation of cardiac activity is the gold standard for the diagnosis of death in clinics. On the other hand, psychological measurement is complex, involving both subjective experiences and objective observations of brain activity. Although we cannot directly equate the electrical activity of the brain to mental processes, these electrical patterns are currently our closest approximation of mental activity [26, 27, 28]. For instance, stimulation of the brain’s somatosensory and motor regions can elicit corresponding sensory and motor responses and subjective experience. Similarly, stimulating the temporal lobe can trigger patients to recall past events and even complex images. The seizures experienced by individuals with epilepsy provide compelling evidence for the relationship between brain electrical activity and psychological states [29]. Even though we cannot yet fully equate electrical brain activity with mental processes and acknowledging that various factors, such as neurotransmitters, continually influence brain activity, neuroimaging remains the most objective measure of mental activity so far [30, 31]. As neuroscience continues to advance, we expect that the accuracy and immediacy of these measurements will improve, opening up extensive opportunities for further exploration and measurement of mind and its interaction with the physical body.Early stages of our neuroscience research discovered that heart-brain synchronicity is enhanced during mindfulness breathing exercises [32]. Mindfulness meditation, along with other Eastern traditions that include yoga, places emphasis on both mind-body training and the aspiration to achieve unity between mind and body. Two observable aspects of the mental training are trait and state, terms familiar within psychological theory. Trait refers to the long-term changes in one’s temperament after practice, while state describes temporary changes occurring at the time of practice.Our early studies found that mindfulness training can cause temporary state changes, including synergistic alterations in heart activity and brain activity during mindful breathing. These changes primarily reflect a harmonization of the activity and cardiac activity entropy in relevant areas. However, no difference was observed before and after an 8-week training period, indicating that while state-related physical and mental changes were identified, trait-related changes were not [32]. As analytical techniques continues to advance, subsequent research found that changes in alpha wave peaks and cardiac synergy metrics increased after 8 weeks of training. This implies that 8 weeks of mindfulness training can also yield long-term benefits on traits, dominated by a change in brain-heart interaction, measured by the correlation between the peak of the frontal alpha wave and heart coherence. Brain-heart connection may be more a sensitive index to monitor mental practice [13]. This suggests that short-term mindfulness breathing exercises can immediately alter the state of physical control in the human brain, while long-term mindfulness training effects changes in the frontal lobe, the control area of human brain cognition. This corroborates the age-old wisdom that immediate adjustments can alter the physical behavior of the body, but changing mental behavior requires a more prolonged experience (Figure 2).Figure 2.Illustrates the brain-heart connections through maps. The connection strength (R-value) was determined by calculating the correlation between alpha peak frequency and heart coherence (left column), as well as the correlation between alpha coherence and heart coherence (right column). The upper row displays the normal rest control condition before and after an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training, while the lower row represents the mindful breathing condition before and after MBSR training. The color indicates the differences in R-values before and after MBSR training. The black dots indicate electrodes with significant differences before and after MBSR training (p < 0.05, uncorrected) https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2023.1008490.Meanwhile, medical research and neuroscience also increasingly recognize the significance of mind-body integration, affirming the intricate interconnections between the brain and the heart. These interactions significantly influence cognitive function, emotions, and physiological processes [33, 34]. Also, our research probes into the potential links between our brain and heart, the fascinating dynamic rhythm they perform together in our physiology and psychology, and why the harmony between them matters so much to our health. Understanding these essential facts would spark fresh ideas on how one can bolster the coordination between the brain and heart through individual training, such as yoga and other meditation routines (Figure 3).Figure 3.Depicts the correlation between the entropy of whole brain EEG and the entropy of heart rate during MBSR practice (red line), contrasting with the absence of such correlation during normal rest (blue line). The small dots represent channels with significant correlation between HR entropy and each EEG channel. For a more detailed understanding of the color references in this figure legend, please refer to the web version of this article. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2016.01.001.The brain and heart both have electrical activity. For example, brain has different electrical waveforms and exhibits different cognitive-emotional and arousal states. Mental concentration is accompanied by fast waves such as beta and gamma waves, and the relaxed awake state is accompanied to alpha waves. The heart generates its own electrical rhythm, which is further refined by signals from the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, two-way communication is achieved mainly through the autonomic nervous system (ANS) connection [35]. The vagus nerve is the main channel for information transmission, which transmits perceptual data about the state of the cardiovascular system through neural pathways to brain regions such as the brainstem, amygdala, and insular cortex. Cortical structures, in turn, regulate heart rate and heart function through vagus output [36]. This rate and pattern of information transmission produces rhythmic oscillations that synchronize brain and heart activity, referred to as neuropsychological coordination phenomena.In humans, the nervous system is divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the human brain and spinal cord. The PNS is made up of the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary skeletal muscles, and the autonomic nervous system, which controls the heart muscle, smooth muscle, and glands [37]. The autonomic nervous system is further divided into the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) for fight or flight responses and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) for rest and digestion. The main communication channel between the brain and the heart is via the vagus nerve, which belongs to the PNS. However, other neural pathways exist while play minor roles in brain-heart connection [38].The heart itself contains complex networks of clusters of nerve cells (ganglionated plexi or GP) on the outer surfaces of the atria and ventricles. These networks, located within the epicardial fat pads, constitute the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system. This system consists of interconnected GP, ganglia, and nerve fibers [39]. It interacts with the extrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system, which originates from the brain. The intrinsic GP nerve networks likely function as integrative hubs that coordinate complex autonomic signals between the extrinsic and intrinsic cardiac nervous systems, allowing sophisticated control over cardiac functions [39].These nerves establish extensive neural connections for bidirectional information transmission and feedback between the brain and heart. These anatomical structures serve as interfaces linking the central and autonomous nervous systems and participate in the sympathetic regulation of cardiovascular and abdominal organs. The sensory nerves of the cardiovascular system and the heart convey information about blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, and oxygenation to the brainstem area via the vagus nerve, including the subnuclear area. This area integrates these visceral sensory data and sends them to brain regions, such as the amygdala and the insular cortex. Conversely, the brain regulates heart function through the vagal motor pathway, originating in the medulla oblongata. The circular respiratory center including subnuclear area can further integrate the visceral sensory data and send them to other brain regions, such as the amygdala and the insular cortex [40]. The latter is related to emotion and can influence cognition eventually.When EEG and ECG rhythms are synchronized and maintain a stable phase relationship, this is known as neurocardiac synchronization. It is characterized by the frequency of heart rate variability matching the EEG alpha waves. Neurocardiac synchronization forms the foundation of the brain-heart connection and significantly impacts physiological and psychological health [41]. The level of synchronization reflects the functional state of stress-related pathways. Different psychological states exhibit variations in synchronization with positive emotions and relaxed states showing higher harmony, while stress and anxiety are associated with dysregulation. As an indicator of overall resilience and adaptability, neurocardiac synchronization positively correlates with emotional stability and cognitive function [42].Neuropsychological coordination aids in achieving emotional stability and the recovery from negative emotions. The extent of coordination can indicate how effectively the cerebral dopaminergic prefrontal lobe regulates the amygdala’s emotional responses. Individuals with higher coordination levels experience lower anxiety and more robust positive emotions. Interestingly, in high-stress situations, such as combat training, individuals with greater neurocardiac coordination exhibit a reduced heart rate response and quicker recovery, indicating enhanced physiological resilience to stress [43]. A lack of brain-heart coordination often signals a poor clinical prognosis for conditions, such as depression.Coordination between brain-heart rhythms positively correlates with emotional stability, cognitive enhancement, and increased physiological resilience. For instance, the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic influences in heart rate variability affects emotional states with lower HRV in stress and depression [44]. Brain-heart connectivity significantly influences health, with ongoing studies revealing its impact on cognition, emotion, resilience, and clinical outcomes [45]. Higher cognitive readiness and capabilities are found to have a direct correlation with the index on synchronization of brain EEG alpha waves and heart rate variability with [46]. Enhanced brain-heart coordination is associated with improved performance in cognitive tasks, such as attention and memory, and this coordination is related to neurobiology of consciousness [47].The disciplines of meditation and yoga always emphasize mind-body training that can confer benefits by optimizing neuropsychological coordination. This harmonization is considered one of the pivotal mechanisms contributing to their psychological and physiological advantages. Meditation, particularly the yoga practices is for cultivation of a synchronized relationship between the brain and the heart, which is believed to be crucial for deepening the mind-body connection. Generally, meditation practices are known to enhance the synergy between respiratory and circulatory rhythms, leading to a more coherent physiological state that supports overall well-being [48]. This improved synergy can result in a more efficient oxygen exchange and a calmer more rhythmic heartbeat, which together promote a state of relaxation and mental clarity [49]. Furthermore, the focused attention and mindfulness inherent in yoga and Zen meditation practices are instrumental in heightening inner awareness and interoception. This heightened awareness allows for a greater understanding of the body’s internal signals, fostering a deeper connection with one’s physiological states and emotional landscape [50]. Through these practices, individuals can develop a refined attunement to their internal experiences, contributing to improved self-regulation and presence. Advertisement 3. Differences between Yoga and Zen meditation traditionsAlthough Zen and yoga both aim to foster mind-body integration and enlightenment, they adopt distinct methodologies and prioritize different aspects of the experience [50]. Nowadays, yoga often means training physical postures, but traditional yoga training involves much more on meditation and ethical living. The ultimate objective of yoga training is to merge individual consciousness with universal consciousness, and Yogis refers this as self-realization or enlightenment. Zen Buddhism, a unique branch of Mahayana Buddhism that appeared in China and later spread to Japan and other East Asian regions, diverges from this approach. Zen mainly focuses on practice known as “zazen” or seated meditation, and more uniquely Can-Hua-Tou, the inquiry meditation [51]. This form of meditation is central to Zen practice and is aimed at achieving deep states of absorption and insight.The core practice of Zen Buddhism revolves around cultivating “mushin,” a state of pure consciousness devoid of conceptual thought. Zen practitioners often employ short stories or paradoxical anecdotes known as koans to trigger this state and to illustrate the nonconceptual essence of reality [52]. Zen Buddhism prioritizes the attainment of direct experiential insight, downplaying the value of theoretical knowledge and eschewing superfluous and elaborate religious ceremonies. The ultimate aim of Zen is satori, a sudden flash of profound realization or awakening. This moment of enlightenment unveils the “true nature” of reality and the self, affirming that ordinary life itself embodies enlightenment. Zen and yoga, while distinct in their practices, both seek to engage practitioners into a direct yet profound experience of reality and self-awareness that transcends daily thought patterns. Both of the practices encourage and cultivate the virtues of mindfulness, discipline, and ethical living, both in pursuit of inner serenity and balance. Nevertheless, yoga offers a comprehensive approach that includes physical postures, breathwork, and meditation, whereas Zen mainly focuses on meditation and mindfulness all through the daily living. Despite their different paths, both aim to illuminate the mind and enrich the spirit [53, 54].In addition, Zen meditation, in particular, offers a distinctive cognitive flexibility that yoga practice may not have, also there is intensive mental inquiry. Intuitive inquiry meditation is a specialized Zen technique that employs the cognitive function of doubt to actively and intuitively investigate the concept of self. Our neuroscience research examined the effects of long-term intuitive inquiry meditation of Zen practice on brain responses to self-pattern processing. This research offered intriguing insights into how Zen practice influences self-concept and concept of Buddha belief and doubt [51]. It is a meditative practice characterized by persistent questioning and doubt, fostering deep introspection [55]. This method prompts practitioners to challenge and eventually relinquish all fixed ideas, including those of the Buddha and the self. Research indicates that intuitive inquiry meditation can specifically alter the brain’s reaction to self-related concepts. When presented with images of themselves and the Buddha, seasoned monks exhibited a diminished neural response to their own image during meditation, but not to the image of the Buddha. This implies that for these practitioners, the meditation’s focus has shifted more toward an internal conceptualization of “self,” demonstrating a more flexible approach to processing self-identity [51]. The study’s outcomes suggest that intuitive inquiry meditation (Zen Buddhism) leads to a more adaptable and detached mindset when engaging with the concept of self.Figure, Zen monks show a more flexible brain activity when comparing Zen and normal condition-Fig. 5ERSP data from channel Fz exhibit differences between the two conditions when viewing pictures of the self. Significant differences were found at approximately 200 ms among monks (p < 0.05, FDR corrected). No significant interaction was found using ANOVA (Figure 4).Figure 4.ERSP data from channel Fz indicate differences between the two conditions when viewing self-pictures. Monks showed significant differences around 200 ms (p < 0.05, FDR corrected) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e20075.This aligns with Zen Buddhism’s teachings on the wisdom of nonattachment and the transient nature of existence. It reveals that through prolonged practice, Zen meditators can cultivate a mental state that enables them to swiftly move beyond self-identity, thereby attaining a profound comprehension of selflessness.Zen Buddhism, thus, necessitates continuous meditation to train the mind for direct enlightenment (Satori) through immediate, intuitive understanding of reality’s nature. It emphasizes the practice of meditation (zazen) and mindfulness in daily life to recognize the true essence of self and reality, transcending conceptual and dualistic thought. Enlightenment in Zen is often described as an awareness of one’s own nature or Buddha nature, acknowledging the transience and interconnectivity of all existence, and understanding the fundamental emptiness of all phenomena [56].

cations for health, wellbeing, and self-realizationThis chapter offers valuable insights into the distinct approaches Zen and yoga take toward the concept of self and their potential effects on the brain’s processing of self-patterns. It underscores the importance of further research in this field to enhance our comprehension of these ancient practices and their implications for mental health and well-being. The research also suggests that Zen Buddhism and yoga, while different, are complementary systems within Eastern philosophy, sharing similarities and possessing fundamental differences. Both of Yoga and Zen aim for the elevation of the human spirit and self-transcendence, yet they offer divergent interpretations of the ultimate goal and conceptual understanding. Yoga, stemming from the Sanskrit word “Yuj,” meaning “to join” or “to unite,” aspires to realize the union of the individual self (Atman) with the universal consciousness (Brahman). Through this union, practitioners aim to transcend egocentricity in the process of self-realization, acknowledging the interconnectedness of life and the unity between the individual and the cosmic self. This union is believed to bring about inner peace and equilibrium [57].Conversely, Zen Buddhism’s philosophy is nuanced differently. It underscores the concept of “emptiness” (Sunyata), a central tenet of Mahayana Buddhism and the essence of Zen. In this context, emptiness is not mere “nothingness” or “void,” but a state denoting the absence of inherent or independent existence. It is an appreciation of phenomena that all elements, including the self and the universe, are interdependent and in constant change, devoid of any eternal, and unalterable essence [58]. From this vantage point, the primary distinction between Zen Buddhism and yoga lies in their perception of the end goal. Yoga seeks the “union” of dualities, whereas Zen Buddhism aims to transcend duality, directly experiencing the fundamental emptiness and interrelatedness of all things, leading to a profound realization of the impermanence and dynamic nature of reality. Zen Buddhism advocates for surpassing the final barrier to enter a state of “non-duality” or “absolute reality,” transcending all concepts and illusions [58]. Within the theoretical framework of yoga, the individual self (Atman) and the cosmic self (Brahman) are viewed as distinct entities that can achieve “union.” In contrast, Zen Buddhism emphasizes the inherent emptiness and interdependence of all phenomena, dismissing the notion of an independent, immutable “self” or “universe.” In Zen, the non-dualistic awareness does not involve the fusion of two separate entities but rather a direct apprehension of the fundamental interconnectedness and mutual dependence of all existence.While Zen Buddhism and yoga may seem to chart different paths, at their heart lies a shared quest for oneness, transcending the self-imposed boundaries of the individual ego. Yoga navigates through a dualistic lens seeking unity, whereas Zen Buddhism embraces a non-dualistic view that goes beyond such distinctions. This Zen perspective invites a profound shift in how we perceive our world, urging us to look past the mirage of separation and to appreciate the web of connections that bind everything together [59]. It is not just about grasping the fleeting nature of existence; it is about living in harmony with it finding tranquility in the very transience that defines life.This essence of Zen is palpable in its practices, such as Zazen and Koan, where such non-dualistic truths are not just understood but lived moment to moment [60]. Meanwhile, emerging neurophilosophies have expanded our view beyond the brain-heart dialog to include a network of bodily communications, such as the gut-brain axis and the interplay between our breathing and heartbeat. Yet, even as science delves into the brain-heart connection with a reductive lens, it only scratches the surface of the profound interplay at work in the meditative traditions of Zen and yoga, where the dance of mind and body unfolds in layers far too intricate for simple models to capture.In the practice of Zen Buddhism and yoga, this broader mind-body integration consciousness can only be implicitly recognized. For example, the practice of breath control in yoga, or pranayama, is seen not only as a way to regulate bodily processes but also as a way to achieve mental clarity and emotional calm. The practice of meditation sees a more holistic, systematic interweaving of physiological and cognitive processes, and more importantly, the interaction that collectively shapes our subjective experience. Zen Buddhism places particular emphasis on the direct role of mind consciousness and even enlightenment. Overall, both Zen Buddhism and yoga are effective tools for us to understand the world and the self and achieve self-transcendence. They offer two different but complementary perspectives that help us understand the nature of life and find peace and fulfillment (Ramsden). These philosophies may help modern people cope with the pressures of the multitude of tasks and the dizzying amount of information; after all, there is nothing new information in the world, mediocrity is self-inflicted, and all things are connected according to the philosophy of Yoga and Zen; There is no need of re-connection.They provide complementary perspectives that help us grasp life’s nature and find peace and fulfillment. In a world, where the pressures of numerous tasks and overwhelming information weigh heavily, these ancient practices offer us tremendous mental benefit and health. References 1.

(Toby Melville/WPA Pool/Getty Images)By Reuters12/10/2019Updated: 12/10/2019PrintLONDON—Prime Minister Boris Johnson will bolster his argument on Dec. 10 for leaving the European Union early next year, urging voters to return him to power so Britain can “rip up the EU rule book and write a new one for ourselves.”Just days before Britain votes in an election that he called in order to try to break the deadlock over Brexit, Johnson will repeat his desire to “finally get Brexit done” on a tour of traditionally Labor-supporting areas he hopes to win over.Johnson has put his oft-repeated pledge for a quick Brexit at the heart of his election campaign, hoping to win the backing of those who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.The main opposition Labour Party has also said it will get Brexit “sorted” in six months, but its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has put more emphasis on policies to increase spending on healthcare and education, and increase the role of the state.“If (we) do break free, there’s a bright future waiting for us with all the opportunities of Brexit,” he will say on a campaign trip to Staffordshire in central England, according to excerpts of his speech.“We can literally rip up the EU rule book and write a new one for ourselves ... We can do all this and so much more if we regain our independence—we just need to vote for it, one more time, this Thursday.”Opinion polls put Johnson in the lead before the Dec. 12 vote, but some have shown Labour is catching up, and with so many Britons still undecided, the result is hard to predict.Johnson’s team hopes to break the opposition party’s hold on voters in regions of northern and central England, the country’s so-called red-wall, who have, sometimes for generations, rejected his party’s overtures.The Conservative message is a simple appeal to those Labour supporters who backed Brexit—only Johnson will get it done. Labour says even if Britain leaves at the current deadline of Jan. 31, that would only mean the beginning of what could be lengthy new trade talks with both the EU and other countries.“The stalemate in parliament has held this country back for too long,” Johnson will say. “It’s time to send in the bulldozers and smash through the gridlock.”By Elizabeth Piper Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowReutersAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesDollar on Track for 5th Straight Weekly Gain, Yen FragileFeb 16, 2024Oil Slips as Weaker IEA Demand Outlook Offsets Rate Cut HopesFeb 16, 20242 Fans Came to See Kansas City Chiefs; They Stopped Suspected ShooterFeb 15, 2024Wall Street Opens Flat After Mixed Economic DataFeb 15, 2024Related TopicsBoris JohnsonBrexitCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

Twitter and Instagram photos took forever to appear, and opening a news story in Safari was hanging. I did a speed test using the Ookla app and got an abysmal 0.01 Mbps download and 1.05 Mbps upload. Minutes later, another test jumped up to 4.75 Mbps download and 0.24 upload, but a third test was again at 0.02 Mbps download and 0.76 upload.”Some users could fix the problem via disabling WiFI Networking via Privacy --> Location Services --> System Services.“Did I make a mistake by updating to iOS 8? What’s your experience so far? My iPhone 5 is burning through battery life a little too fast,” one user wrote on Twitter.Said another, “No battery drain fix?”“ Battery life is actually better on iOS 8. Go figure,” wrote another user.“iOS 8 drains my battery much faster and the phone gets hot all the time. Very annoying,” wrote another user.

(Steve Helber/AP Photo)By Zachary Stieber2/3/2024Updated: 2/3/2024PrintUpdated COVID-19 vaccines did not confer any protection upon people who were already vaccinated and had a history of infection, according to a new study.Vaccinated people who took one of the shots actually saw a slight decrease in protection against infection, researchers in Japan found.They compared people who had received at least two doses of the original Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to people who received a bivalent shot on top of at least two doses of the originals.“We did not find sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of bivalent vaccines among previously infected older adults,” the researchers, with the Department of Health Care Administration and Management at Kyushu University and other institutions, said.The paper was published following peer review in BMC Infectious Diseases.The corresponding author for the study did not respond to a request for comment.Related StoriesCOVID Variants Resist Antibodies From 2nd, 3rd COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines2/1/2024Reports of Myocarditis Spiked During First Year of COVID-19 Vaccination: Study1/31/2024“I would interpret the study to mean that in those without previous infection a booster vaccination is more important and valuable [than] in those with previous infection where the impact may be smaller or non-existent,” Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, clinical professor of medicine, population and public health sciences at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, told The Epoch Times via email.In vaccinated people without prior infection, the study estimated a bivalent booster added 18.6 percent protection against infection.When stratifying by time among the entire study population, researchers estimated a bivalent booster initially added 0.6 percent protection. The added protection peaked at 26.5 percent protection and dropped to 21.7 percent protection after 34 days.Limitations of the paper included not examining the long-term protection from the bivalent vaccines. Funding came from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. Authors declared no conflicts of interest.The bivalent vaccines were available in the United States, Japan, and some other countries from the fall of 2022 to the fall of 2023. They were introduced, without clinical trial data, because the original vaccines stopped performing as well against emerging variants of the virus that causes COVID-19.The shots were widely recommended in the United States.The bivalent vaccines have since been replaced by new monovalent shots that target the XBB.1.5 virus subvariant, although that strain has since been displaced in many places.In Japan, the new shots are available to the population but authorities are only recommending them to the elderly and people with underlying health problems.In the United States, officials recommend the new shots for virtually every person aged 6 months or older, regardless of whether they’ve been infected before. Just 22 percent of adults and 11 percent of children have received one of the new shots, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).“We do need nuance in our vaccine recommendations—vaccination has less benefit in younger people, those generally healthy, and in those recovered from infection,” said Dr. Klausner, who was not involved in the research. “Vaccine efforts should be targeted to those most at risk of complications and severe disease like the elderly, those with chronic medical conditions or immunocompromise or in either of those groups without prior infection.”Japan used two versions of the bivalent shots, one targeting the BA.1 subvariant and another based on the BA.4/Ba.5 sublineages. The United States only used the version that targeted the latter.Other New StudiesSeveral other new papers have focused on the bivalent vaccines, including one from South Korea.Researchers there reported that BA.1 bivalent shot recipients with previous infection actually did worse against protection, with adjusted effectiveness pegged at negative 77 percent. For vaccinated people who had a prior infection and received the other bivalent shot, the protection was estimated at 59 percent.Among vaccinated people who did not have prior infection, protection for both versions was estimated to be about 35 percent.“The BA.1-based bivalent vaccine was effective only in individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection,” the researchers said.The study’s limitations included a lack of stratification by vaccine manufacturer, funding came from the Korea University College of Medicine, and no disclosures were listed.European researchers, in another paper, estimated that bivalent vaccines provided strong protection against severe illness initially but that the shielding dropped to near-zero over time.The researchers examined records of adults aged 60 or older who experienced severe acute respiratory infection between February and August 2023. They estimated vaccine effectiveness started at 80 percent against the infection but dropped to 0 percent beyond 269 days.The researchers did not adjust for prior infection, a fact they listed as one of the limitations of the paper. Funding came from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Declared conflicts included sponsorship from Pfizer for one author and payments from Pfizer for another.

Traders are using the current weakness in both the Euro and in regional equity markets to establish long term positions in the early part of the new year. Looking at the sector details, we can see that cyclicals saw some of the most heavy buying activity was directed toward financials, metals and manufacturing companies (all showing a rise of more than 4 percent on the week).Helping support European banking stocks was optimism related to the Long Term Repo Operation (LTRO) as markets begin to view the current ECB strategies with more credibility and with the expectation that the worst of the debt crisis is now behind us. It still remains to be seen how long this optimism can last but with a 12 percent rally in the Greek equity markets, the investment community does seem to be making a strong statement relative to its longer term expectations.The financial sector in the Eurozone will continue to be one of the main focuses, especially with European Banking Authority (EBA) capital requirement deadlines occurring into the end of this month. The other main focus is the earnings season in North America, which so far has produced mixed results but still managing to beat most market estimates.We did see strong results from the four largest US banks but this week, most of the attention will be placed on the technology and consumer staples companies. Some of the bigger releases will come from Apple, Siemens, Conoco Phillips, Johnson & Johnson and Proctor & Gamble. Since Apple tends to get most of the popular headlines, this release will likely cause a great deal of short term volatility, especially given the latest release of the iPhone 4S during the 2011 Christmas season.Another potential event risk will be seen this week with President Obama’s State of the Union speech. Generally, this event doesn’t do much to move markets but given the current economic climate and the budding election season in the US, there is potential here for a market-worthy surprise. Later in the week, we will also have the next Federal Reserve meeting and Ben Bernanke press conference and this will all be concluded on Friday when we will see the first release of US GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 2011. Market estimates are for this number to come in at roughly 3 percent on a quarterly basis.Technical Analysis:The GBP/USD is continuing its impressive hourly rally but we are starting to see some signals suggesting that a turning point is nearby. The MACD reading is rolling back over after hitting the zero line and there is a confluence of resistance levels that will likely hold, at least on first test. The main areas to watch are the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the declines from 1.6160, as this coincides with the 100 day EMA and the daily downtrend line. We look to sell at current levels, with a stop above this resistance targeting a test of the lows at 1.5330.The FTSE 100 is continuing its slow ascent higher but is coming dangerously close to major historical resistance at 5760. We have been watching this level for a while as it represents the top made last October and the previous breakdown point seen in July. This lends to the argument for establishing short positions with stops above 5790, targeting a move at least 200 points lower. An upside break here, however, would be a very bullish signal longer term.

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)By Tom Harris9/26/2016Updated: 9/26/2016PrintOn Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will hear arguments in the litigation over President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan (CPP). If implemented, the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) regulation will require states to develop and bring into force plans to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from existing power plants.The focus for opponents of the CPP will be its questionable legality. However, the ten judges hearing the case should also keep in mind that the rules are pointless. The CPP will have no measurable impact on climate.EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy has repeatedly admitted this before Congressional hearings. She maintains that the CPP is still worthwhile because, to quote from her Sept. 18, 2013 testimony before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power, it “is part of an overall strategy that is positioning the U.S. for leadership in an international discussion, because climate change requires a global effort.”Setting a good example would make sense if it were known that a man-made climate crisis was imminent and developing nations, the source of most of the world’s emissions, were likely to follow our lead.But developing countries have indicated that they have no intention of following us. They will not limit their development for “climate protection” purposes.For example, on July 18, Philippines’ President Rodrigo Duterte said about the Paris climate agreement, “You are trying to stymie [our growth] with an agreement... That’s stupid. I will not honor that.”Duterte can say this with a clear conscience. The United Framework Convention on Climate Change, the foundation of the Paris Agreement, gives an out clause for developing nations. Article 4 of the treaty states, “Economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties.”Actions to significantly reduce CO2 emissions would entail dramatically cutting back on the use of coal, the source of 81 percent of China’s electricity, 71 percent of India’s, and 29 percent of that of the Philippines. As coal is by far the least expensive source of electric power in most of the world, reducing CO2 emissions by restricting coal use would unquestionably interfere with development priorities. So developing countries simply won’t do it.From a climate change perspective, it probably won’t matter. After all, even the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change admits that surface temperature, averaged over the land and ocean, increased only about 1.5 degrees between 1880 to 2012 despite a reputed 36 percent rise in atmospheric CO2 content. And it is well known that the impact of CO2 rise diminishes as the concentration increases.Given also that there has been no general increase in extreme weather or the rate of sea level rise, the primary rationale for actions to restrict CO2 emissions boils down to the possibility of dangerous climate change in the future.Obama summed up this concern in his Sept. 20 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, saying, “If we don’t act boldly [to restrict emissions], the bill that could come due will be mass migrations, and cities submerged and nations displaced, and food supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair.”Obama’s forecasts are based on computer models of future climate states, simulations that have failed in the real world. In his Feb. 2, 2016 testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space & Technology, Dr. John Christy, distinguished professor of atmospheric science at The University of Alabama in Huntsville, said, “These models failed at the simple test of telling us ‘what’ has already happened, and thus would not be in a position to give us a confident answer to ‘what’ may happen in the future and ‘why.’”After polling 9.7 million people from 194 countries, the U.N.’s My World global survey finds that “action taken on climate change” rates dead last out of the 16 suggested priorities for the agency. The judges hearing the CPP case must realize that, in comparison with access to reliable energy, better health care, government honesty, a good education, etc., most people across the world do not care about climate change. They understand that we have real problems to solve.Tom Harris is executive director of the Ottawa, Canada-based International Climate Science Coalition.

A State Department official didn’t dispute that some emails will never be made public.“We continue to process the next set of former Secretary Clinton’s emails for release under the FOIA process and will have more to say about it later,” the official said. “As always, we take seriously our responsibilities to protect sensitive information.”READ MORELilly Ledbetter, Women’s Equal Pay Activist, Endorses Hillary Clinton for President Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowEpoch NewsroomAuthor FollowAuthor’s Selected ArticlesPhoenix Audience Sees Beauty and Wisdom in Shen YunFeb 16, 2024‘The Dancing Is Unbelievable’ Says Phoenix Audience MemberFeb 15, 2024Shen Yun Concludes 4 Sold-Out Performances in SapporoFeb 15, 2024BBC Presenter Says Shen Yun Is ‘Elegance Personified’Feb 15, 2024Related TopicsHillary ClintonemailsecretCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.
