333af076d0e357edbd588597b1531abc,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-01-drug-opioid-surgery.html#!,surgery|patients|NAC|pain|Researchers,,surgery,This article has been reviewed according to Science X's                                                      editorial process\n\nand policies.                                                     Editors have highlighted                                                     the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nResearchers in the Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) have found that an FDA-approved drug may help to decrease pain after surgery. In the pilot study published in Pain Management,,,, the Jerry G. Reves Endowed Chair in Basic Science Anesthesiology Research and a senior author of the published study. Scofield has conducted laboratory research on NAC, an anti-inflammatory drug that is used to treat acetaminophen poisoning, mushroom poisoning and liver damage. Researchers, such as Scofield, have also studied its effects on the nervous system, especially in the areas of addiction and pain perception. Wilson's clinical goals and Scofield's research on NAC made them ideal collaborators.\n\nThis project is really an elegant synthesis of basic science and clinical research, using things we find have efficacy in the laboratory and taking them to the clinic, said Scofield.\n\nWilson believes that partnerships between physicians and basic scientists can spur clinical advances. She credits the supportive environment within the department fostered by Chairman Scott Reeves, M. D., and former College of Medicine Dean Jerry G. Reves, M.D., for making such partnerships possible.\n\nThe research team chose spinal surgery patients for its pilot study because these patients often experience chronic pain before surgery and are more likely to be exposed to higher levels of opioids before, during and after surgery. During surgery, patients received a standard regimen of anesthesia in addition to a dose of NAC or a saline infusion. Information on patients' pain and opioid consumption was then collected.\n\nIn the 48 hours after surgery, patients who were administered NAC via IV infusion (150 mg/kg) received 19% fewer opioid doses on average than patients who received saline. NAC patients also reported lower pain scores and took a longer time to request pain medication after their surgery than the saline patients. The researchers were especially encouraged to see that the beneficial effect seemed to last longer than the NAC was expected to remain in the body.\n\nWe've seen the impact of giving this medication persisting, and I think that's significant, said Wilson. We're not seeing a rebound effect when that medication wears off.\n\nThis extended effect on pain perception mirrored previous findings from Scofield's laboratory research.\n\nFor heroin addiction, we had seen in NAC preclinical studies that protection against relapse vulnerability is long lasting, said Scofield. Certainly, the hope is that it's something that has a long duration.\n\nNext, the research team wants to investigate whether the findings can be translated to other procedures. They are currently enrolling patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomies in a larger trial. As more patients are enrolled, the researchers will be able to conduct more in-depth statistical tests to improve their understanding of the effects of NAC on surgery-associated pain. This will help them to set the stage for future clinical trials of NAC during surgery.\n\nTo change practice, you need many large clinical trials with different settings, different types of surgeries to show that you're going to cause benefit, not harm, said Wilson. We want to show good clinical efficacy," but also safety in that situation.

She said, “You have to style your hair according to what you are wearing (i).” She explains, “When I have a big sweater, I like to push my hair back so that my face is showing. Sometimes I don’t like to braid or ponytail, so I use a headband.”\n\nYou would need the large Velcro rollers to make the rolls in the long hair. Curls on long hair would appear elegant and attractive. The curls would shine if you possess silky and smooth hair. So make sure that the hair is detangled, soft, and shiny before the styling is done.\n\nBangs are famous. Get the cuts and brush them inward with either a side parting or a middle parting. If the hair is naturally straight then the bangs would not be prominent. Don’t forget to apply a good styling product to keep the bangs in place.\n\nTie your long hair the Rapunzel style. This style is a clear signal that all of us can be stylish like the beautiful Disney princesses. Brush the hair properly and then tie the hair in small sections. The sections should be a little puffed to give volume to the pony!\n\nSelena Gomes sports this style very elegantly. This polished side part is easy to achieve. Brush the hair and tuck it behind the ears.\n\nThis look is messy, effortless, and perfect at the same time. Curl the hair into tiny ringlets, make use of a texturizing product and finger comb it to get the messy feel.\n\nLicensed hair stylist, Megan Senner says, “You can control the level of messy depending on the pillowcase you use. For example, if you want it messy but still put together to wear to work, use a silk pillowcase, and if you want an extra messy just-left-the-beach look, then you should sleep on a cotton or fabric pillowcase.”\n\nAfter curling the hair, soften them by brushing them with a boar bristle brush to get these waves and tuck it behind the ear. Wear flashy earrings to compliment this super sexy coif.\n\nSenner adds, “To keep your hair tucked securely behind your ear, use a bobby pin to hold it in place. Consider buying bobby pins that match your hair color, so it blends in and looks invisible.”\n\nCurl your hair and gather it on one side. The bouncy effect is bound to entice away the glare of so many onlookers!\n\nTease it out and pin back those natural curls. Notice the unusual zigzag part this style has, which gives more volume in the front. The bangs are brushed away in a slant manner contouring the forehead.\n\nSection your hair in a middle part and make some natural-looking curls to copy this Sofia Vergara style for your next party! Curls on long hair are always gorgeous. Decorate the hair with a big flower. You are bound to look like a beach babe!\n\nOne of the simplest and unique updos for long hair is to make a bun. A bun is a classic and timeless hairstyle. Braid the front section of your hair and gather the remaining hair into a bun. A bun demonstrates power, authority and experience. Among all this is one such evergreen and unique braided hairstyles for long hair  with a modern twist. You can make it messy , carefree, and a little more chic by adding a ‘French braid’ on one side.\n\nGet that sultry volume; backcomb the roots of your hair and viola! You are ready for a date night! The sexy curl of the bangs near the forehead makes the ultimate cut in the style statement.\n\nBraid from the base of your neck, yes you might need help! Use a good styling product for the style to remain smooth and fresh. Since the style itself is so detailed, the need for accessorizing is reduced. Go simple and let the style flash! To sum it all up just tie everything, the braid, the rest of the hair into a slightly higher than medium knot bun.\n\nTease your hair from the roots and plait it on one side. Check out the wavy bangs, the mildly wavy bangs add to the flowy flair. The unique hairstyle for long hair is very simple but classic; you can wear it with anything you want. Be it a dress or just denims.\n\nGet your hair super straight and use a gel to slick it back. This is an ultra sexy stylish coif. Wear this style to a high end part and you are bound to get applauds!\n\nWrap the hair around a wand iron and spray some hair product and loosen the curls with fingers. The gentle soft waves are subtle yet noticeable.\n\nMake a high pony, braid it in the fish style, and you have the coif for a wild theme. The fishy mane will not only attract attention but also decrease the need to use any accessory. The style is in itself enough to amplify your looks.\n\nSenner gives a pro tip on this hairstyle, “If you have short hair, you can achieve this look by putting your hair into a high ponytail and attaching a ponytail extension clip. You can get these ponytail clips in either synthetic or natural human hair. Synthetic hair is typically cheaper, but human hair looks more natural.”\n\nGive a faux mohawk effect by braiding the one side of the hair. The mini braids enhance both the thick highlighted waves and the wavy bangs.\n\nRoll out the wave and spray the hair styling product on them. It just looks like you have rolled out of bed and got the curls. No effort required.\n\nSport a fish braid and you do not have to fish for compliments. It could be a neat or a messy one, choose whatever suits you and flaunt it with all the confidence you have got. The fishy style is never going to let you down.\n\nSpray salt water on the strands and scrunch from ends to root. Gather all the hair on one side and you are good to go. The texture is tousled but exudes a sexy appeal. The style would be chic with deep kohl rimmed eyes.\n\nThose long locks can get a fresh update with this fringe cut. Wear this style with bright lip color. It complements the style and blends in rather well.\n\nTie and pin up random strands from your hair to give the bob like effect.\n\nMiddle part your hair and tie it up in a low or a high pony.\n\nBring out your flat iron and put on this sleek look.\n\nFlat iron your hair and put some gel on it. Spread it across the strands. Push back the hair backwards and spray aerosol so that the hair does not fall upward.\n\nBraid your hair from the front like a tiara or a headband. The style will look wonderful on long locks. If you choose to open the hair, curl it.\n\nKeep them straight or curl them, caramel highlights always exude sexiness.\n\nYou can tie up the straight strands or leave it open.\n\nLeave your curly locks open and flowing. Apply glow serum to ramp up the style.\n\nFake shorter strands by curling up the hair. Curling shortens hair by two inches.\n\nGather a cute chignon to one side of the head. Part the hair, put in one loose chignon, and leave some strands in the front to give it a tender feel.\n\nWrap your long tresses into a top bun. Keep it loose or tight. Either way it’s sexy!\n\nGet this simple, uncomplicated, and affordable style in a few minutes. A middle parting, leave some strands in the front and puff up from the crown to give that volume.\n\nDamp your hair with some spray and make some soft, interesting waves. Style the hair with a side part or just backcomb.\n\nEasily recreate the dry look by spraying salt spray all over the hair. Remember to go with light makeup and yes, a dark red lipstick to steal the show.\n\nGo bohemian! Take two sections of hair from near your hairline, twist and secure with pins at the back of your head. Curl the rest of the hair using jumbo curlers.\n\nGo for the different layers to amp your style. Chopping longer locks in layers always gives a unique effect.\n\nThis coif is tousled and not kept too tight. Keep this style loose to get the extra edge. The chignon here accentuates the sultriness.\n\nPutting a bold accessory on some part of your head or style can enhance the whole effect. Go for whatever suits you, a simple flower or tiny beads can just accentuate the style.\n\nTease the crown, create a bump and tie up the tail near the nape of your neck. Play with the style by keeping it loose and leaving some strands open.\n\nAdd some shine serum to those straight tresses and get the neat feel.\n\nTake a teasing comb and tease the hair around the crown to give a puff and the tie up a high pony.\n\nBig hair is fun and sexy. Leave the style open or braid the tresses.\n\nNothing looks sexier with long hair other than a high tie up hair.\n\nWeave a simple braid, twist the strand from near the hairline and merge it with the braid. Simple and sexy!\n\nBraids are always sexy on long hair. Try fish braid for an experimental look.\n\nYou would need a hairstylist for this unique long hairstyle. But a good change from the regular bun. The form of these buns appears like a sunflower! But the style is indeed unique. Wear it if you think you can carry it. The long tresses would be tied into various mini buns to get this big bun!\n\nBring out your inner child by wearing your hair in pigtail plaits! These plaits with a zig-zag part and a delicate mini-braid between two main braids are a treat to the eyes. Both the braids are tied at the base of the head and braided again till the end for a unique appearance.\n\nThe rope braid hairstyle involves twisting two separate sections of your hair in one direction and then crossing them over each other in the opposite direction, creating a twisted, rope-like effect. You may also enhance the hairstyle further with the help of accessories such as hairpins and colorful ribbons to it.\n\nIs it unprofessional to have long hair?\n\nNo, long hair by itself is not unprofessional. However, styling it neatly in hairstyles that are suitable for a professional environment is a must. Untied, unkempt, and unmanageable long hair is unprofessional.\n\nWhat do you do with long hair after a shower?\n\nPost wash, pat your hair with a microfiber towel to remove excess water. Use a conditioning serum while your hair is still damp. Detangle your hair when it is dry or damp (70% dry). Let them air dry. If you are in a hurry, use a blow dryer at the lowest setting.\n\nYes.

Importantly, this work advances both the understanding of how HRF contributes to susceptibility of certain individuals in developing allergic disease as well as begins to unravel the mechanisms involved, he said. What is most encouraging is the demonstration that the effect of HRF to enhance allergic responses can be blocked, thus suggesting the possibility of new therapeutic strategies in allergic diseases.\n\nThe research study points to the development of new therapies based on blocking HRF interactions with certain antibody (IgE) molecules, long known to be central causes of allergies. The new study also found two novel peptides (N19 and H3) as strong therapeutic candidates for blocking the HRF and IgE interactions. Peptides are protein pieces which spur various molecular actions. The two peptides inhibit the interactions of the HRF and IgE molecules, thereby stopping the allergic cascade in mouse models.\n\nBased on our preliminary studies, we believe these HRF inhibitors may provide a new, innovative therapeutic avenue for the treatment of asthma and some allergies, said Dr. Kawakami, lead scientist on the study, published online today in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.\n\nHannah Gould, Ph. D., a professor and prominent allergy researcher at King's College in London, said the study advanced scientific understanding in several key ways. The research community has long believed that the histamine releasing factor (HRF) played some role in triggering allergic responses and asthma in certain individuals, she said. However, the identity of the primary binding partner, the HRF receptor, the unique characteristics of the IgE in these individuals, and the mechanisms involved in HRF activity have remained elusive until the present study by Dr. Kawakami and his team.\n\nThese findings suggest a potential treatment for allergy and asthma patients who have HRF reactive IgE, she continued. We can look forward to the future results of pre-clinical and clinical studies in the human system.\n\nThe prevalence of asthma has been dramatically increasing for the last few decades and has reached epidemic proportions in the U. S. and other industrialized countries. Twenty million patients suffer from asthma in the U.S. alone, including nine million children. Meanwhile, 10 to 20 percent of the population of industrialized countries suffers from some form of allergies. Both illnesses are immune system disorders.\n\nThere is a huge need to understand these diseases and to find therapeutic interventions, said Mitchell Kronenberg, Ph. D., president and chief scientific officer of the La Jolla Institute, a world leader in immune system research. Allergies and asthma are a cornerstone of the La Jolla Institute's research activities dating back to our founding scientists, who were the discoverers of the IgE molecule in the 1960s. Dr. Kawakami's latest discovery is in keeping with our history of innovation in allergy research.\n\nAllergic reactions occur when a person's immune system reacts to normally harmless substances in the environment, referred to as allergens. When exposed to an allergen, IgE molecules activate white blood cells called mast cells and basophils. These cells release histamine and other compounds, which produces allergy symptoms that can range from uncomfortable to dangerous. In asthma, inhaled allergens can induce airway inflammation, causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath.\n\nDr. Kawakami said the HRF molecule has been studied for many years and was thought to play some role in the cellular interactions leading to allergies and asthmas. However, its exact purpose and mode of operation was previously not clear. Nasal drainage, skin blister fluids, and some bronchial fluids were found to contain HRF secretions, so the scientific community suspected that HRF was important, but we didn't know why, said Dr. Kawakami.\n\nHRF studies had been limited by several factors over the years, he added, including the inability to model HRF interactions in mice. In addition, Dr. Kawakami said failure to identify the HRF receptor also slowed progress. It's very, very unusual for many years to pass between the discovery of a molecule and the identification of its receptor, he said. In this case, 15 years had passed. Without the receptor, we couldn't understand the role of this protein in asthma and allergies.\n\nDr. Kawakami and his team were the first to solve this mystery in 2007 -- identifying a subset of IgE and IgG molecules as HRF receptors. This information gave Dr. Kawakami's group the critical missing piece of the HRF puzzle and enabled the researchers to map HRF's role in allergy activation.\n\nDr. Kawakami's team also previously discovered that tremendous heterogeneity exists in the IgE molecules. The original work, funded by NIH, provided the foundation for the latest findings on HRF's role in triggering allergies. The differences were big in terms of affecting the activation and survival of mast cells, he said. That's why we got interested in this molecule (HRF). Earlier studies had suggested that HRF does not bind to IgE molecules. But I was not convinced, so I decided to explore this further.\n\nTheir study results showed that 20 to 30 percent of IgE molecules can interact with HRF molecules and produce mast cell activation leading to allergies. We think HRF is important for amplifying allergic reactions initiated by IgE and an allergen, said Dr Kawakami. The findings were published today in a paper entitled," Proinflammatory role of histamine-releasing factor in mouse models of asthma and allergy.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date. There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.\n\nTo know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below. This will give you a glimpse into the world of astrology tailored for your baby.\n\nVedic astrology, also called Jyotisha, provides deep insights into a person’s life based on celestial positions at birth. Rashi and nakshatra, which are an integral part of Jyotisha, are believed to influence an individual’s personality and life events. The following sections give you rashi-related information, such as the associated letters, elements, ruling body, quality, and nakshatra for the name Michell. These details help analyze a person’s characteristics, personality, and behavior. As shown in the following table, each rashi is associated with specific sounds, which are often used as the starting letters of names for newborns in Hindu families. Each rashi is represented by a figure and one of the five elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether (Space). One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth. There are 27 nakshatras, each with its own unique qualities, attributes, and symbolism. Each rashi contains two-and-one-fourth nakshatras in it. For example, Aries contains Ashwini, Bharani, and Krithika nakshatras.\tThe below table provides information on the nakshatras’ degrees on the zodiac circle, their lords and related syllables, for babies born in the Simha (Leo) rashi.

Less than 20 percent of registered voters on average came to the polls in 2013,,,,000 prizes or one hundred $1,000 prizes.\n\nBut there has been criticism of the idea, too.\n\nThe LA Times Editorial Board called it “one of the worst ideas we’ve heard in a long time,” noting that it “fails to address the deeper reasons why people don’t vote,” including apathy, ignorance, or critical personal issues.\n\nOthers are concerned that monetary incentives could skew the outcome of an election by bringing uninformed voters to the polls. But the Ethics Commission says studies show that people who know they are going to vote are more likely to pay attention to the issues.\n\n“If we weren’t dealing with a crisis, we wouldn’t be considering any of this,” Hochman said. “For the people who don’t want voter drawings as an answer, we invite you to come up with some other solution that will drive significant more numbers to the polls.”\n\nGroups such as the Municipal Elections Reform Commission have suggested that changing the dates of city elections from odd- to even-numbered years to coincide with larger elections would help. They also recommend holding fewer special elections to save time and money for the city and voters. Hochman says these changes could take years.\n\nFederal law prohibits paying people to vote, but the Ethics Commission says the federal law would not apply to a purely local election.\n\nCalifornia and Alaska are the only two states that allow incentives for voting," although the money cannot be used to encourage people to vote for a specific candidate or measure.

He has no relatives in the province, and the Canada-U.S. border closure is keeping the brothers apart.\n\n“I don’t know how I’m going to get my sibling up here,” Zahl said in an interview.\n\nPremier Stephen McNeil called the rampage that began Saturday night in the quiet community of Portapique and ended at a gas station in Enfield on Sunday “one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province’s history.”\n\nBut officials reminded Nova Scotians that the community would have to mourn together from a distance to stop the coronavirus from spreading, as cases and deaths from the illness also climbed.\n\nDr. Robert Strang, the province’s chief medical officer of health, acknowledged at his daily news COVID-19 news conference Monday that it would be “hard for people to hear” reminders about the need for physical distancing in the aftermath of the killings.\n\n“COVID-19 is not going to pause because of our pain—we cannot let our guard down,” Strang said.\n\nSimon Sherry, a professor in the department of psychology and neuroscience at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said while social and ritualized aspects of grief are important, they represent only one part of coping with death and dying.\n\n“At an individual level, people can still make meaning and reach acceptance, even amid a pandemic and the heavy weight of a mass shooting,” he said in an interview Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday night, people across Nova Scotia were asked to express their grief by stepping outside at 8:30 p.m. to light a candle or shine some kind of light.\n\nOthers have displayed solidarity by posting photos of sunsets across the province. Toronto-based singing group Choir! Choir! Choir! announced a Facebook live performance of Leonard Cohen’s ‘Hallelujah’ scheduled for Thursday. A virtual vigil is planned for Friday evening, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would attend.\n\nSherry said that kind of new ritual can be an important gesture of solidarity.\n\n“When your community, when your province is suffering through grief like this, it’s important to emphasize a connection to community .... It’s important to refocus on community.”\n\nA memorial with flowers and tributes sprung up outside the RCMP headquarters in Dartmouth this week to honour Const. Heidi Stevenson, who was killed in the line of duty.\n\nBut Stevenson’s funeral will look different from those held for slain officers at other points in Canadian history _ like the regimental funeral for Fredericton police constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns in August 2018 that was attended by hundreds of police officers and first responders from across the continent.\n\n“It’s going to require some out-of-the-box thinking. I really don’t know where they’re even going to begin,” said Brian Sauve, president of the union representing RCMP officers.\n\nHe said such events are always uniquely tragic and challenging, but there are possibilities available during the pandemic, such as livestreaming and inviting guests to park along roadways.\n\n“There are ways in today’s day and age to honour the fallen,” he said. “It’s just in a different format.”\n\nQuentrel Provo, an anti-violence and gun control activist who founded Stop the Violence, Spread the Love in Halifax, led a virtual candlelight vigil Monday night, opening with a prayer, a moment of silence and a reading of victims’ names during a livestream on Facebook.\n\nProvo said it was emotionally tough to lead the event, which he set up to offer some hope as Nova Scotians feel overwhelmed by the pandemic and the violence of the weekend.\n\n“A lot of tears have been shed. I know myself, I’ve cried a lot in the last few days,” he said in a telephone interview Tuesday.\n\n“If we’re hurting, it’s unimaginable the pain the families are going through right now, but we’re trying to come together and be strong and show them support during this time.”\n\nProvo said he plans to pay tribute to the victims by lighting a candle each night for the next 20 days, and he said people should continue to support each other and the families into the future.\n\nSherry said people should be careful not to suppress their grief during the pandemic—and it’s important to recognize that people will deal with grief in their own way.\n\n“There is no one, particular timeline or course that someone needs to follow as they move through grief, loss and trauma,"'' he said.

To move up to a less-restrictive tier, though, a county must stay within those metrics for at least two weeks.\n\nTo get to the red tier, the county has to have a case rate per 100,000 population of 4 to 7, a positivity rate of 5 percent to 8 percent and a Health Equity Quartile rate of 5.3 percent to 8 percent.\n\nThe red tier allows for many more businesses and organizations to reopen. For instance, retail stores could allow for half capacity instead of 25 percent, and museums, zoos and aquariums could reopen for indoor activities at 25 percent capacity, as could movie theaters, gyms and restaurants.\n\nKnott’s Berry Farm in Buena Park on Monday announced a virtual “National Hiring Day'' on March 13 in anticipation of its plan to prepare for reopening. The theme park is looking to hire about 1,700 people for a variety of jobs throughout Knott’s, including food and beverage, cooks, ride operators,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Asthma Outcomes in Clinical Research: Report of the Asthma Outcomes Workshop,,,, asthma clinical research has lacked a common set of outcomes, measures used by researchers to assess a disease during the course of a study. This lack of standardization has made it difficult to compare results between individual studies and to share data across studies, thus hindering the progress of asthma research.\n\nThe report identifies standard definitions and methodologies for measuring seven groups of outcomes that are important in asthma clinical studies: symptoms, exacerbations (asthma attacks), biomarkers (biological substances that indicate disease state), lung function, quality of life, asthma control questionnaire results, and health care utilization and costs. By using the same set of outcome measures in asthma clinical studies, researchers will be able compare their results more efficiently. This proposed standardization across asthma studies promises to enhance the development of prevention and treatment strategies and lead to improvements in the quality of asthma care.\n\nBased on the recommendations of the report," NIH and other federal agencies will require the inclusion of the proposed outcomes in future government-funded asthma clinical research.

Mr. Holtzman saw the performance on Thursday night, April 5.\n\n“It’s really remarkable that people can perform at such a level,” Mr. Holtzman said of the quality of the performance.\n\nEspecially intriguing to him was the company’s orchestra, comprised of both Western and Chinese instruments: “It was also interesting to see the way there’s a mix of classical [Western] instruments and the classical Chinese—there’s three classical Chinese instruments right in the center. They’re very prominently featured.\n\n“It’s great to hear those instruments in a hall where I usually hear classical [Western] music—to hear them working with the other classical performers ...

Epstein’s body was discovered in his jail cell in August 2019 after he reportedly hanged himself while awaiting trial.\n\nThe remarks came during an interview with SiriusXM host Megyn Kelly. New York City’s chief medical examiner,,,, he was informed that his brother’s death could not be called a suicide “because it looked too much like a homicide.”\n\n“So then the questions became if he didn’t commit suicide, then he was killed, and then who killed him? How was it done?” Mr. Mark Epstein continued before presenting photos of his brother’s autopsy.\n\nThe photos showed injuries to Epstein’s neck, which looked more like a wire or thin rope had been used to strangle him, as opposed to marks from the alleged bed sheet that was reported to be used in the alleged suicide.\n\nMs. Kelly also said she failed to see how the marks on Epstein’s neck could match what was conveyed in the official narrative.\n\n“I have a hard time, as a layperson, understanding how a sheet made that mark,“ Ms. Kelly said after being presented with the photos. ”It’s almost like garrote was used or some sort of rope wire.”\n\nDuring the interview, Mr. Mark Epstein also pointed out several other inconsistencies, such as the reported malfunction of the security camera outside Epstein’s cell, Epstein’s body having been moved after he was found dead, and Mr. Mark Epstein’s inability to get answers from the government.\n\nMark Epstein said afterward that he was not satisfied with the official conclusion about his brother’s death and added that he would like the case to be reinvestigated.\n\nRecently released documents showed multiple high-profile individuals on Jeffrey Epstein’s flight log of his private jet," including billionaire and Microsoft founder Bill Gates and former U. S. President Bill Clinton.

According to local news in Bogotá the application was filed by Maria Isabel Santos Cabalerro, Juana Manuela Marroquín Santos and Juan Sebastian Marroquín Santos, Escobar’s widow and children respectively who changed their names after settling in Argentina in the late 1990.\n\nThe three had requested the international recognition of the trademark for the purposes of education, training and recreation.\n\nThe Commission of Industry and Commerce refused to register a trademark which bears the name of ‘the most notorious drug lord in Colombia’s history’, adding it would be immoral and subvert public order’. It said the name Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria is associated with a dark period of violence in Colombia that claimed thousands of lives as he fought extradition to the United States.\n\nSome Iranians thought a government ban had been lifted after they were able to access Twitter and Facebook on Monday\n\nIranians got direct access to Facebook and Twitter for the first time in four years because of a technical fault, an Iranian official has said, denying suggestions the government had lifted a ban on social media.\n\nOn Monday evening, several Iranians said they gained access to their accounts without having to get round a government firewall, leading them to hope that authorities had relaxed a ban in place since anti-government protests in 2009, some of which were organised on social media. ...\n\nAllamurat Ametov – a farmer from Karakalpakstan – refused to “donate” one ton of rice per hectare of his cultivated land to the regional khokim (administrator). He was sued and as a result his farm was taken away.\n\nThe 28-year-old farmer from the Nukus region of Karakalpakstan, presently unemployed, says that he is very disappointed with the justice system in the country.\n\n“I have been filing complaints and petitions to all the levels of the justice system for the past four years – the attorney general, the national security services chair, the supreme court, the minister of justice, the prime minister … all to no avail,” says Mr. Ametov.\n\nFacebook has apologized and banned a dating company from advertising on its website after an ad featured a photo of Rehtaeh Parsons, a Halifax teen who died in April after a suicide attempt.\n\n“This is an extremely unfortunate example of an advertiser scraping an image from the Internet and using it in their ad campaign,” Facebook said in a statement emailed to the Star. ...\n\nThe ad featured a photo of Parsons with the caption: “Find Love in Canada!

Inspiring, is it? Why not try a similar poem that describes what you think of your baby’s personality?\n\nNicknames are an integral part of your communication with your baby. You tend to use several variations of your child’s name; some are meaningful, while others are simply adorable sounds. Here are a few nicknames you can begin with for the name Mihira.\n\nWestern astrology includes the construction of a horoscope based on the person’s exact time of birth and location to understand the positions of the planet, stars, and zodiac signs at that time.  However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date. There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.\n\nTo know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below. This will give you a glimpse into the world of astrology tailored for your baby.\n\nVedic astrology, also called Jyotisha, provides deep insights into a person’s life based on celestial positions at birth. Rashi and nakshatra, which are an integral part of Jyotisha, are believed to influence an individual’s personality and life events. The following sections give you rashi-related information, such as the associated letters, elements, ruling body, quality, and nakshatra for the name Mihira. These details help analyze a person’s characteristics, personality, and behavior. As shown in the following table, each rashi is associated with specific sounds, which are often used as the starting letters of names for newborns in Hindu families. Each rashi is represented by a figure and one of the five elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether (Space). One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth. There are 27 nakshatras, each with its own unique qualities, attributes, and symbolism. Each rashi contains two-and-one-fourth nakshatras in it. For example, Aries contains Ashwini, Bharani, and Krithika nakshatras.\tThe below table provides information on the nakshatras’ degrees on the zodiac circle, their lords and related syllables, for babies born in the Simha (Leo) rashi. These syllables/phonetics are popularly used to choose the baby name.

244db2c0b568cae64ffb75e5ce696e33,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-03-choice.html#!,choice|Savani|time,heart|heart-attack,choice,(PhysOrg.com) -- Too much choice can be a bad thing—not just for the individual,,,, but did they really have a choice?” Americans tend to assume that what people do and what happens to them is under their control, is a consequence of their choices, and is their own personal responsibility.\n\nAlong with Nicole Stephens of Northwestern University and Hazel Rose Markus of Stanford University, Savani looked at how thinking about choice affected people’s feelings on public policies. For example, in some experiments, participants watched a video of a person doing a set of routine daily activities in an apartment. Some people were told to push the space bar every time he made a choice; others were told to do so every time he touched an object for the first time. They were then asked their opinions on social issues.\n\nSimply thinking about ‘choice’ made people less likely to support policies promoting greater equality and benefits for society, such as affirmative action, a tax on fuel-inefficient cars, or banning violent video games. Another experiment found that when people think about choice, they are more likely to blame others for bringing bad events on themselves, like having a heart attack or losing a job.\n\nSavani and his colleagues wondered if this was also true for people outside of the U. S., so they tried an experiment in India. After choosing among consumer objects like pens and chocolate bars, both American students and Indian students were shown a photograph of a poor child and given a description of his life. Thinking about choice led Americans to be less empathetic, but had no effect on Indians. “In America, we make choices all the time—in the cafeteria, in the supermarket, in the shopping mall,” Savani says. He wonders if, in the long run," all those consumer choices might have a cumulative negative impact by making people less sympathetic towards others and less concerned about the collective good.

It is native to the Southeast Asian regions. It is used to treat many health ailments. However,,,, and nausea. If left untreated, this condition can lead to an acid build-up in the body to dangerous levels – leading to shock and death (3).\n\nAnimal studies have shown the anticancer effects of mangosteen (4). But studies on humans are yet to be conducted. Mangosteen products are often marketed to cancer patients as dietary supplements.\n\nSome research shows that these supplements may interfere with cancer treatment and adversely affect blood sugar levels (5). In another report, certain antioxidant supplements were found to reduce the effectiveness of conventional radiation therapies (6).\n\nAs mangosteen supplements are often marketed for their antioxidant potential, it is important to exercise caution.\n\nSome research has shown subjects experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms after consuming mangosteen for over 26 weeks. Some of these symptoms included bloating, diarrhea, gastric reflux, and constipation (7).\n\nThe derivatives of mangosteen caused depression and sedation in rats. The effects had also resulted in decreased motor activity (8). However, more studies in humans are required to establish these effects.\n\nThere is limited evidence if mangosteen can cause allergies. But anecdotal evidence suggests that it may cause reactions in people sensitive to the fruit. If you experience any reaction after consuming mangosteen, stop intake and visit your doctor. Mild symptoms are a skin rash and stomach upset.\n\nThe safety of mangosteen during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not yet established. Hence, stay safe and avoid use. You may consult your doctor regarding the same.\n\nMost of the adverse effects of mangosteen are yet to be established by concrete research. If you are usually susceptible to allergies or reactions, you may want to talk to your doctor before taking the fruit.\n\nMangosteen was banned in the US by the FDA because it could be a host to import Asian fruit flies into the country. The ban was lifted owing to precautionary irradiation of the fruit, which was a treatment done to disinfect it. The method of irradiation is still under controversy despite its claims that it does not compromise with the taste and nutrition of the fruit (9).\n\nHowever, food supplements containing mangosteen continue to be banned by the US FDA. Such supplements are mostly unregistered, and not much is known if they may cause any adverse effects (10).\n\nCan the adverse effects of mangosteen be prevented if the fruit is taken in the right dosage? We have explored it in the following section.\n\nThe dosage of mangosteen is dependent on several factors, such as age, health, and medical conditions of the consumer. The composition of dietary supplements, such as mangosteen-based proprietary health drinks, is unavailable. There is no authentic literature available on the appropriate dosage of mangosteen that is to be consumed for preventing the adverse effects. More research is warranted in this regard. Hence, please talk to your doctor regarding the dosage.\n\nThe term “mangosteen” is commonly used interchangeably with “kokum”. However, the two are different. Learn more about the differences in the next section.\n\nMangosteen and kokum are often confused with each other due to their uncanny resemblance. This also is likely due to the fact that they belong to the Clusiaceae family. However, they differ in taste and usage.\n\nMangosteen has a delicious sweet flavor with a hint of tanginess and is consumed fresh. On the other hand, kokum has a sour and tangy taste and is used as a flavoring agent in Indian dishes to add a zesty touch. Plus, kokum is not consumed fresh.\n\nWhen is mangosteen not healthy?\n\nMangosteen may not be healthy when taken in excess. In a few, it may trigger allergies, constipation, bloating, and acid reflux.\n\nNo, mangosteen doesn’t raise blood pressure. In fact, it has hypotensive properties that can effectively manage high blood pressure.\n\nNo, anecdotal evidence suggests that mangosteen has a low purine content, which are substances that are broken down into uric acid.\n\nCan the skin or rind of the mangosteen fruit cause any adverse reactions when consumed or applied topically?\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that topical application of the skin or rind of mangosteen may cause allergic reactions in some people, especially those with sensitive skin. Also, excess consumption of the mangosteen rind may upset your stomach. However, limited data is available to prove these claims.\n\nGet a better understanding of mangosteen, and why you should incorporate this fruit into your diet.

Editors have highlighted                                                     the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA jump in the number of people with serious illness caused by group A Streptococcus—also referred to as Streptococcus pyogenes or Strep A—has made headlines recently. There has also been a higher than usual number of deaths from group A Streptococcus infections,,,, as well as superficial skin infections and skin infections known as pyoderma.\n\nHowever, Group A Streptococcus can sometimes develop into invasive infections that put patients' lives at risk, such as necrotizing fasciitis, septicemia (blood poisoning) and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.\n\nTo generate this wide range of diseases in different parts of the body, the organism has several factors that promote infection and allow the bacteria to invade, colonize and survive in different tissues. These include molecules such as superantigens, exotoxins and adhesins that help pathogens evade the host immune system.\n\nA new variant of group A Streptococcus called M1UK was first reported in the United Kingdom, where it has been linked to an increase in scarlet fever cases as well as an increase in invasive infections.\n\nMembers of the M1UK sublineage exhibit an ability to enhance the expression of the superantigen SpeA due to a single genetic mutation. The over-production of SpeA may be responsible for increased transmission and survival, as well as the aggressiveness of these infections, although this is currently being studied.\n\nUp to approximately 10% of school-aged children will commonly carry these bacteria in their throats and upper respiratory tract without having any symptoms, and over time will develop some level of immunity to it.\n\nIt is likely that during the COVID-19 pandemic, children were at home and not being exposed to the bacteria as much as before and so their immune systems are probably not as good at fighting these infections. Without this exposure, some children are likely to be more susceptible to infection.\n\nThe spread of the new M1UK strain is also probably why there's an increased number of cases, although this is something that is currently being studied.\n\nGenerally, Canadians should not be overly concerned because serious infections with group A Streptococcus are still quite rare.\n\nHowever, people should also not ignore strep throat, and should get treatment from a doctor and be wary of symptoms that might suggest an invasive infection.\n\nStrep throat requires treatment, as untreated strep throat can lead to other problems including invasive infections.\n\nBecause group A Streptococcus are common and many carriers are asymptomatic, it can be difficult to avoid exposure. Practicing good hand hygiene, covering coughs and sneezes, staying home when you're sick and not sending children to school if they have a very sore throat are all good measures.\n\nIf you believe you have a strep infection such as strep throat with painful swallowing, fever, swollen tonsils or a rash, talk to a family physician to determine if the infection is caused by group A Streptococcus. A rapid strep test can be done with a throat swab. If the test is positive, antibiotics can be prescribed.\n\nInvasive group A strep infections are very dangerous and are a medical emergency, although initial symptoms may not be obvious. These could include fever, chills, flu-like symptoms and nausea or vomiting, but in particular red and warm skin infections that may be very painful and spread rapidly.\n\nThere is strong evidence that prior viral infections such as chickenpox can predispose people for developing invasive group A Streptococcus. Children with chickenpox should be watched carefully for symptoms of invasive group A Strep.\n\nCurrently, there is no vaccine against group A Streptococcus, although there is a vaccine for chickenpox. Multiple research teams around the world, including our own lab," are working towards developing an effective vaccine against this human pathogen.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

She took the family dog to the home where St. Onge lived and saw the woman in her garage, waiving her hands for help.\n\n“I was so scared, but happy she was alive,” Dawn said.\n\nShe went back and called 911 and sent her husband to cover the woman with a blanket before emergency service workers arrived on the scene.\n\nSt. Onge’s daugher, Sandy Mitter, told a local paper that her mother slipped on Saturday night after she went out to eat dinner. She was not able to get up.\n\n“We think she laid there for two to two-and-a-half hours,” Mitter said. “She kept trying to yell for help and was banging on the wall for neighbors.”\n\nShe described DiPietro as heroic. “Thank you so much,” she said. “You’re my hero.”\n\n“He saved her life, that’s for sure,” Mitter told the paper. “And I don’t even have the words to say how grateful we are.”\n\nDiPietro, who is in the fifth grade," said it’s “cool” to be considered a hero.

These cousins of the plum typically come in dried form. You can use these fruits in sweet and savory dishes like stews,,,, and medications also determine how intake of prunes can affect you. Here are a few side effects of eating prunes:\n\nPrunes contain a high concentration of acrylamide, which is considered a carcinogen and a neurotoxin (1). Acrylamide is not naturally found in normal food, except when it is cooked at temperatures above 100° C.\n\nAccording to Food and Agriculture Organization, the amount of acrylamide required to cause neuropathic harm is about 500 times the daily dietary intake. So, consuming prunes is relatively safe. However, the carcinogenicity is a concern as prunes were found to be highly carcinogenic to the animals that were tested in labs.\n\nIf you have ever wondered ‘Do prunes make you poop?’ They do. If consumed in excess, the insoluble fiber in prunes can cause or worsen diarrhea. This is why you need to avoid them when you have diarrhea (2). There have also been certain cases of people who had experienced diarrhea post the ingestion of prunes and prune juice (3). But why do prunes make you poop and worsen diarrhea? This can be attributed to the laxative property of prunes. They are natural laxatives as they contain a laxative compound called sorbitol. So, an unregulated dose or having too many of these fruits can easily lead to diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance or even an allergic reaction.\n\nSome sources also talk about the dietary fructose intolerance found in many individuals, which can also lead to abdominal pain and diarrhea. Prunes contain high amounts of sugar, which might trigger such a problem.\n\nOne serving of 6 uncooked prunes contains 137 calories and 22 grams of sugar. That sure is a little on the higher end. And a one-cup serving of prune juice contains about 185 calories. Some believe that the fiber in prunes can promote satiety and possibly help with weight loss. However, taking them in excess can have the opposite effect.\n\nPrunes also have a high glycemic load (how much any particular food will raise a person’s glucose levels post consumption) (4). This means overconsuming prunes can elevate your blood sugar levels more than most other fruits.\n\nPrunes are nutritious and can be beneficial for digestion and weight loss. However, excess consumption of prunes may result in gastrointestinal issues. They contain complex carbohydrates and sugars that do not completely break down in the digestive tract (5). So, when the sugars reach the colon, the bacteria start feeding on these undigested carbohydrates.\n\nThese bacteria are responsible for intestinal gas and bloating. This can also lead to farting. You can take alpha-D-galactosidase before eating prunes as it reduces intestinal gas by breaking down the complex carbohydrates before they reach your gut.\n\nPrunes are mostly used as irritant laxatives. However, those who suffer from frequent constipation should not rely on prunes completely to clear their digestive system. This can lead to laxative dependency after a certain period of usage, which can aggravate the condition and cause nutrient deficiency among other complications (6).\n\n@Sectioned, a mental health blogger, explained how she found out about the laxative effect of prunes. She says, “Don’t take too many. Once, before I knew the laxative effect of prune juice, I drank a whole liter in one go. That’s how I know it works. Now, I just drink a glass (i).”\n\nPrunes are rich in iron and, like most iron-rich foods, can cause dark stools if taken in excess.\n\nPrunes are high in sugar and calories (7). While they can be a healthy snack option, their excessive consumption may lead to weight gain in pregnant women. However, limited data is available in this regard. They are also rich in dietary fiber and consuming them in excess may lead to several digestive issues. While pregnant women are sensitive to changes in their digestive system, it is important to eat prunes in moderation to prevent these issues.\n\nIn addition, prunes have a moderate glycemic index that may cause a gradual increase in blood sugar levels (8). Hence, it is essential to monitor the intake of prunes, especially if you are a pregnant woman with gestational diabetes or are at high risk of developing it.\n\nPrunes have their own set of side effects, but you can still consume them in moderation. Also, consult your doctor if you experience any side effects from eating prunes.\n\n“Yes. Since prunes are rich in soluble fiber content, this slows down the absorption of the natural sugar they contain. They are low-glycemic fruits, perfect for people with diabetes. But it’s essential to note that quantity is important. If someone with diabetes eats too many prunes, their sugar intake may be too high. So, two to three prunes per day is a good serving size for people with diabetes,” says Eva De Angelis, Dietitian Nutritionist.\n\nEva De Angelis says, “It depends. While some foods have been linked to acid reflux, the effects can be different for different people. And this also applies to prunes. For some, this dried fruit can be a healthy choice and even make them feel better. Yet, for others, prunes can lead to acid reflux.”\n\n“No. Prunes made just from plums, with no added sugar, are nourishing and rich in fiber, calcium, boron, and potassium, all essential minerals for bone health. A serving size of 5 to 6 prunes per day is a good amount. Yet, like any dried fruit, they are high in natural sugars, so eating too much can be detrimental.” says Eva.\n\nWhat happens if you eat prunes every day?\n\nPrunes are loaded with many beneficial nutrients. However, eating them in excess may cause diarrhea.\n\nPrunes contain sorbitol, which is hard to digest for some people. This may trigger stomach aches, bloating, and mild nausea.\n\nEva De Angelis says, “This greatly depends on each individual and on the type of IBS they have. For example, if you have IBS with mostly constipation, prunes can act as a natural laxative due to their high fiber content. But if you experience IBS with mostly diarrhea," they are not the best choice.”\n\nDiscover the potential side effects of eating too many prunes.

S. He is wanted in various U.S. states and his July escape deeply embarrassed the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto and strained ties between the countries.\n\nGuzman’s attorney Juan Pablo Badillo has said the defense has already filed six motions to challenge extradition requests.\n\nBadillo said that his client shouldn’t be extradited to the U. S. because “our country must respect national sovereignty, the sovereignty of its institutions to impart justice.”\n\nOn Saturday, a Mexican federal law enforcement official said the quickest Guzman could be extradited would be six months, but even that is not likely because of the many appeals filed by his lawyers. He said that the appeals are usually turned down, but each one means a judge has to schedule a hearing.\n\n“That can take weeks or months, and that delays the extradition,” he said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. “We’ve had cases that take six years.”\n\nMexico’s willingness to extradite Guzman is a sharp turnaround from the last time he was captured in 2014, when then-Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said the extradition would happen only after he finished his sentence in Mexico in “300 or 400 years.”\n\nGuzman was re-apprehended on Friday after a shootout between gunmen and Mexican marines at the home in Los Mochis, a seaside city in Guzman’s home state of Sinaloa. Five suspects were killed and six others arrested. One marine was injured.\n\nMexican authorities say actor Sean Penn’s contacts with Guzman helped them track the fugitive down — even if he slipped away from an initial raid on the hideout where the Hollywood actor apparently met him.\n\nPenn’s article on Guzman was published late Saturday by Rolling Stone magazine, a day after the drug lord’s recapture. In it, Penn wrote of elaborate security precautions, but also said that as he flew to Mexico on Oct 2 for the meeting, “I see no spying eyes, but I assume they are there.”\n\nHe was apparently right.\n\nA Mexican federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to comment on the issue, told the Associated Press the Penn interview led authorities to Guzman in the area of Tamazula," a rural part of Durango state.

You tend to use several variations of your child’s name; some are meaningful, while others are simply adorable sounds. Here are a few nicknames you can begin with for the name Ashvika.\n\nWestern astrology includes the construction of a horoscope based on the person’s exact time of birth and location to understand the positions of the planet, stars, and zodiac signs at that time.  However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date. There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.\n\nTo know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below. This will give you a glimpse into the world of astrology tailored for your baby.\n\nVedic astrology, also called Jyotisha, provides deep insights into a person’s life based on celestial positions at birth. Rashi and nakshatra, which are an integral part of Jyotisha, are believed to influence an individual’s personality and life events. The following sections give you rashi-related information, such as the associated letters, elements, ruling body, quality, and nakshatra for the name Ashvika. These details help analyze a person’s characteristics, personality, and behavior. As shown in the following table, each rashi is associated with specific sounds, which are often used as the starting letters of names for newborns in Hindu families. Each rashi is represented by a figure and one of the five elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether (Space). One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth. There are 27 nakshatras, each with its own unique qualities, attributes, and symbolism. Each rashi contains two-and-one-fourth nakshatras in it. For example, Aries contains Ashwini, Bharani, and Krithika nakshatras.\tThe below table provides information on the nakshatras’ degrees on the zodiac circle, their lords and related syllables, for babies born in the Mesha (Aries) rashi. These syllables/phonetics are popularly used to choose the baby name.

Many children are the same age as my daughter, which makes me sad.

We want to let these refugees see that there are so many people coming to help them to give them hope.”\n\nYi said he saw many Ukrainian refugees sleeping in train stations, McDonald’s, and other public places after crossing the Polish border.

6791e3a99f9d683b9c2bbf87b42196a0,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-02-post-deployment-screening-tailored-advice-mental.html#!,personnel|health advice|UK|health disorders|Forces personnel,,,Few Armed Forces personnel seek help for mental health disorders and novel approaches will be needed to encourage personnel at risk of PTSD,,,, depression or alcohol abuse to seek help will be needed.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2014, the UK deployed more than 220550 Armed Forces personnel to the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts. Among personnel who were deployed, an estimated 4% developed PTSD, 20% developed psychological distress and 16% developed alcohol misuse—similar rates to personnel who were not deployed. Personnel who were deployed in combat roles have higher rates of probable PTSD and alcohol misuse.\n\nIn the UK, mental health support and treatment for Armed Forces personnel consists of psychoeducational briefings, peer support programmes to assist with traumatic stress, decompression before returning home from deployment and clinical services comprising a mixture of uniformed and civilian healthcare professionals. However, approximately half of military personnel with a probable mental health disorder do not seek help. Additionally many delay seeking help or do not finish treatment.\n\nScreening has therefore been proposed as a way to identify those at risk of mental health problems on return from deployment and prompt them to seek help. Various forms of post-deployment screening exist and are used in the US, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands.\n\nIn the study, led by King's Centre for Military Health Research at King's College London (UK), researchers aimed to assess the effectiveness of a particular type of screening. On return from deployment, all 10190 personnel involved in the trial were asked to complete a computerised mental health assessment.\n\nPersonnel in the screening group were then offered the opportunity to view tailored mental health advice based on their likelihood of having a mental health disorder. If they agreed, they were told what mental health issue they probably had, and were urged to seek help by speaking either to a unit welfare officer (for moderate symptoms), a medical officer (more severe symptoms), or told that no professional support was needed if no risk was identified. Personnel in the control group were offered the general mental health advice offered in the UK military—as they would have been if they had not undergone screening. They were told that there were many ways to seek help and were given examples of support provided. All participants were then followed up between 10 and 24 months later.\n\nTwo-thirds (65%; 3619/5577) of personnel who were offered tailored advice agreed to see it, while the remaining 35% declined. Higher ranks and older personnel were more likely to see the tailored advice, and personnel with probable PTSD, anxiety or depression were more likely to view it compared to people who did not have any mental health symptoms.\n\nAt follow-up, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the prevalence of PTSD (11%), depression or anxiety (6%) and alcohol abuse (12%) (table 4). There was also no difference in the rate of health seeking or pharmaceutical use between the two groups, with 12% (496/3996) of personnel in the screening group using a mental health service in the follow-up period, compared to 13% (318/2369) in the control group (table 5).\n\nAt follow-up, about a third of personnel who had probable PTSD, depression or anxiety (excluding alcohol misuse) at the start of the study had sought mental health care over the past 12 months, with no difference between the control and screening groups (35.8% (53/148) in the control group vs. 32.9% (82/249) in the screening group) (appx p.5). Help-seeking behaviour among personnel with probable PTSD, depression or anxiety was similar irrespective of whether personnel chose to view the tailored advice or not.\n\nDifferent countries use different approaches to post-deployment screening and our study looked at one particular type of screening, as it was the form that was most likely to be introduced in the UK military. We found no evidence to support the idea that post deployment screening via a computerised assessment followed by tailored mental health advice helped improve the mental health of personnel over and above general mental health advice. Countries that have already introduced post-deployment screening are not able to assess effectiveness via a randomised controlled trial as they cannot generate a no-screening group, but they should consider monitoring the outcomes of their programmes, says lead author Professor Roberto Rona, King's College London.\n\nThe authors note that the findings from the trial may not be entirely generalizable to other screening programmes, because other programmes use approaches such as repeated assessments over time, or face-to-face interviews (as is the case in the US screening programme).\n\nUnderstandably, military forces are keen to protect the mental health of their personnel who carry out highly challenging duties on behalf of their countries. The question is what can be done to make a positive difference by protecting the mental health of personnel and decreasing the burden of mental illness on individuals, their families and UK society as a whole. More research is needed to improve the mental health of UK Armed Forces personnel and other approaches could include good leadership training, peer and family support programmes and further improving the quality and accessibility of military mental health services, says co-author Professor Neil Greenberg, King's College London.\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Dr Alexander C McFarlane, University of Adelaide, Australia, notes that a potential confounding issue with this study design is the fact that by filling in the self-report measures, both groups had the opportunity to reflect on their obvious levels of symptomatic distress... which might have minimised the ability to find differences between groups. He also highlights the importance of ensuring adequate care is available when personnel do seek help: Even if an individual did present to mental health services in the UK military as part of (this) study, this did not guarantee that an evidence-based intervention was offered," even when a general practitioner was consulted.

6096050e10ecb53e293f68ffdceff9bf,https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/eu-expands-sanctions-against-burma-military-companies-3783727,sanctions|companies|EU|Burma|Today’s decision,equipment,sanctions|companies|burma,BANGKOK—The European Union expanded its sanctions against Burma’s military leaders and army-controlled companies ahead of a regional meeting to discuss the worsening crisis after army leaders deposed the elected government.\n\nThe Council of the European Union’s latest sanctions target 10 individuals and two military-controlled companies already subject to sanctions by the United States,,,, and other measures. EU citizens and businesses are banned from doing business or providing funds to them without special permission.\n\n“Today’s decision is a sign of the EU’s unity and determination in condemning the brutal actions of the military junta, and aims at effecting change in the junta’s leadership,” the EU said in a statement.\n\n“Today’s decision also sends a clear message to the military leadership: continuing on the current path will only bring further suffering and will never grant any legitimacy,” it said.\n\nSince the coup, security forces have killed at least 738 protesters and bystanders, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests. It says more than 3,200 people are still detained, among the nation’s deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint.\n\nThe EU already had an embargo on sales to Burma of arms and equipment that can be used for internal repression; an export ban on dual-use goods for use by the military and border guard police; export restrictions on equipment for monitoring communications that could be used for internal repression; and a prohibition on military training for and military cooperation with the army.\n\nLast week, the U. S. S&P 500 said it was removing India’s Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. from its sustainability index due to its alleged dealings with Burma authorities. Adani did not respond to a request for comment on that move.\n\nFormer U. N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday exhorted the U.N. Security Council to act immediately to halt the violence and protect civilians. So far, the council has not taken such action," which would likely be blocked by China and Russia.\n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations—which is holding a summit on Burma this month—maintains a policy of “non-interference” in each others’ political matters and has rejected the idea of imposing sanctions against the junta.\n\nBan urged ASEAN to send a high-level delegation to Burma. He said he had tried unsuccessfully to make a diplomatic visit himself.

58ddb806dc1075f350e804a55a392df8,https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/countrywide-homes-redefines-local-landscape-1944464,years|CountryWide|we’re|sites|lot,,countrywide,When you sell the fourth-most homes in the Greater Toronto Area,,,, told the Epoch Times in an interview.\n\n“Now we’ve officially established ourselves as a homebuilder, and now we’re going to the next level of calibre. The Mercedes-AMG series is what we like to compare ourselves to. We also have a new design studio we’re going to be building out this year with even higher levels of finishes.”\n\nThe focus of the new addition of approx 3,000 sq-ft will be luxury design, nestled next to CountryWide’s other 6,000 square-foot studio in the rear of its Concord, Ontario, headquarters. The studios are staffed with qualified interior design consultants to help CountryWide homebuyers personalize finishes and upgrades.\n\nCountryWide’s brain trust had the prescience to buy fringe land surrounding the GTA years ago because there were emerging signs that land would become extremely scarce and its costs would consequently surge. It’s one of the reasons CountryWide hasn’t been hampered by the GTA’s housing shortage.\n\nMariani said that because the region is growing at an unprecedented rate, everything, including subways, are now routing northerly. As the need for density grows, high-rises won’t be isolated to Toronto’s core.\n\n“We know the way this city is building and expanding. Townhouses may not be the affordable entry-level option in the GTA anymore; it could be the condo option,” he said. “No builder out there looks at what they’re going to sell for just the next year—they’re looking at the next five years, 10 years, down the road. We’re always trying to forecast what’s coming down the pipe.”\n\nCountryWide had 18 active sites in 2015, and seven sold out. The company sold 650 homes last year, effortlessly smashing its previous record of 575. However, Mariani partly attributes the good fortune to Toronto’s searing market. While CountryWide doesn’t expect to take a step back in 2016, it forecasts a slower sales year.\n\n“We certainly can’t predict the 2016 housing market, but I can say on behalf of our company that we'll anticipate a bit of a slowdown,” he said.\n\n“(Last year) was not realistic; it was a hot, hot market. We’re cautious with what we’re releasing and to whom. There are a lot of factors and variables we don’t necessarily know about, like the Canadian dollar (at a 13-year low). It may hurt the local buyer but could help the foreign buyer. We’re here to sell top-quality houses, and a lot of Chinese investors coming here love our product.”\n\nHe added that CountryWide has 11 sites carrying over into this year, with about six new sites slated to launch sales, give or take a few.\n\nImpressively, and as a testament to its vision, CountryWide Homes is one of three builders—the other two are Aspen Ridge Homes and Lakeview Homes—developing a brand new town north of Newmarket called Queensville. In addition to 6,000 inaugural lots, there will be nine schools, a community centre and library, parks, trails, retail, and dining options. The first phase launched last year with 36- and 45-ft lots and townhomes.  The second phase will be released in the spring/summer of this year.\n\nHowever, closer to home, CountryWide is developing in-demand projects, for which the Chinese community is particularly keen.\n\nThe 531-lot Observatory Hill—eponymously named after the historic Richmond Hill district—is a much-anticipated mix of lots ranging between 30 and 50 feet, and will also include semi-detached houses and townhouses. Mariani said the Chinese community has expressed the most interest in Observatory Hill, and many are anxiously awaiting its late spring launch.\n\n“People are telling us they’re planning their vacations around our opening because they don’t want to miss it,” he said. “It’s another milestone for CountryWide, and I would assume the other three builders building at Observatory Hill, because this piece of land is the only piece left on Bayview. It’s important for us to make a statement there with quality design so that for years down the line people can say ‘I’m proud I bought at Observatory Hill.’”\n\nAnother project coveted by many in the Chinese community is an as-yet unnamed project located at Bayview and Steeles Ave. in North York, slated to be built on the site of the former Tyndale University College & Seminary. The surrounding milieu will incorporate much greenery, and lots will be built as wide as 60 feet.\n\n“This is in North York. There’s not usually any new development there,” said Mariani. “It’s usually in-fill—someone knocks down a house and builds a one-off. We’re doing this through one-on-one private appointments. I'd compare it to buying a full floor at Toronto’s Four Seasons Private Residences.”\n\nThe luxury houses will cost over $3 million and will be designed by the renowned Stephen Hunt of Hunt Design Associates.\n\nWhen it comes to Chinese buyers, Mariani says they’re particularly fastidious about amenities like schools, and as a result, CountryWide pays careful attention to where it builds.\n\n“At all of our sites’ sales centres, we have amenities maps that highlight all schooling in the areas, from elementary schools through high schools and colleges,"” he said. “Now it’s about finding the best schools to build around. We carefully collected sites around good schools. We forecast the land we’re buying around the city.”\n\nNeil Sharma is a Toronto-based freelance journalist.

How long did this happen,,,, this antibiotic can sometimes cause that as a side effect, but you should have it checked out, to be sure.

If I drink more water, will these help? ## Hello, basil46! How are you? Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, so it can cause some excess stomach acid, that may contribute to bloating, but there is also a risk of stomach ulceration, so you should have this checked out by your doctor.

You tend to use several variations of your child’s name; some are meaningful, while others are simply adorable sounds. Here are a few nicknames you can begin with for the name Rishika.\n\nWestern astrology includes the construction of a horoscope based on the person’s exact time of birth and location to understand the positions of the planet, stars, and zodiac signs at that time.  However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date. There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.\n\nTo know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below. This will give you a glimpse into the world of astrology tailored for your baby.\n\nVedic astrology, also called Jyotisha, provides deep insights into a person’s life based on celestial positions at birth. Rashi and nakshatra, which are an integral part of Jyotisha, are believed to influence an individual’s personality and life events. The following sections give you rashi-related information, such as the associated letters, elements, ruling body, quality, and nakshatra for the name Rishika. These details help analyze a person’s characteristics, personality, and behavior. As shown in the following table, each rashi is associated with specific sounds, which are often used as the starting letters of names for newborns in Hindu families. Each rashi is represented by a figure and one of the five elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether (Space). One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth. There are 27 nakshatras, each with its own unique qualities, attributes, and symbolism. Each rashi contains two-and-one-fourth nakshatras in it. For example, Aries contains Ashwini, Bharani, and Krithika nakshatras.\tThe below table provides information on the nakshatras’ degrees on the zodiac circle, their lords and related syllables, for babies born in the Tula (Libra) rashi. These syllables/phonetics are popularly used to choose the baby name.

Here are a few nicknames you can begin with for the name Asmodeus.\n\nWestern astrology includes the construction of a horoscope based on the person’s exact time of birth and location to understand the positions of the planet, stars, and zodiac signs at that time.  However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date. There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.\n\nTo know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below. This will give you a glimpse into the world of astrology tailored for your baby.\n\nVedic astrology, also called Jyotisha, provides deep insights into a person’s life based on celestial positions at birth. Rashi and nakshatra, which are an integral part of Jyotisha, are believed to influence an individual’s personality and life events. The following sections give you rashi-related information, such as the associated letters, elements, ruling body, quality, and nakshatra for the name Asmodeus. These details help analyze a person’s characteristics, personality, and behavior. As shown in the following table, each rashi is associated with specific sounds, which are often used as the starting letters of names for newborns in Hindu families. Each rashi is represented by a figure and one of the five elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether (Space). One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth. There are 27 nakshatras, each with its own unique qualities, attributes, and symbolism. Each rashi contains two-and-one-fourth nakshatras in it. For example, Aries contains Ashwini, Bharani, and Krithika nakshatras.\tThe below table provides information on the nakshatras’ degrees on the zodiac circle, their lords and related syllables, for babies born in the Mesha (Aries) rashi. These syllables/phonetics are popularly used to choose the baby name.

Neurons respond to high concentrations of this protein by producing an autonomous process of synapse elimination. However, the glia secretes many and many molecules and, therefore, SPARC could be the first component of a big group of proteins able to set up the process of synaptic pruning. The study emphasizes the key role that glia plays in the synaptic process, which was unknown so far, concludes Llobet.\n\nThe research team at the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology of the University of Barcelona, headed by Dr Llobet, is working with single-cell micro cultures that do not include glia. Researchers use collagen drops and create micro islands on an agar plate. Neurons only grow in collagen regions, and when a neuron is alone, it finally connects with itself. The neuron becomes pre and post synaptic at the same time. Such a controlled neuronal system allows us studying in vitro glial factors individually, says Llobet.\n\nMoreover, researchers have also carried out experiments with in vivo model of tadpoles Xenopus tropicalis. It has been observed that, when injecting the active region of the protein SPARC (the C-terminal domain) in the tail of tadpoles, they temporally lose their ability to swim.\n\nImages obtained with a confocal LSM microscope show that neuromuscular unions, particularly in muscle-motoneuron junctions and motoneuron axons, retract when protein SPARC is added. Since it is a temporarily effect," tadpoles regain spontaneous movement when innervation is recovered.

Also, some experts believe that a kidney cleanse might harm the kidneys. Having said that, upping your fluid intake and adding the foods suggested in a kidney-flush diet to your regular meal plans may be beneficial for your general health and wellbeing.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that a kidney cleanse is not for everyone. Especially, if you have existing kidney disease or other health concerns, you need to talk to your physician about any changes in your diet, eating patterns, or supplement use. If you don’t have any existing medical conditions, you may want to understand if you even need to cleanse your kidneys in the first place. The next section can help you gain that clarity.\n\nIt depends on how your kidneys are. Being self-cleaning organs, a healthy pair of kidneys won’t require you to go through a restrictive diet. On the contrary, it may deprive your body of various essential nutrients. So, when do kidneys require flushing?\n\nThe kidneys’ primary function is to filter blood and sieve out excess water along with toxins and other wastes that are generated by the body as urine. When there is insufficient water intake, it may become difficult for the kidneys to clear out all of the waste. Chronic stress, environmental toxins, and a diet poor in fruits and vegetables can also deter the kidneys from functioning at their optimum capacity (2). Kidney detox through herbal remedies may be a beneficial way to support kidney health and maintain a healthy urinary system. If you have any medical condition, consult your doctor before using any herbal remedy as a kidney detox to avoid adverse herbal-drug interactions.\n\nDr. Peter Michael, MD, says, “It typically takes about 48-72 hours for the kidney to flush out naturally. This time can vary from person to person depending on a variety of factors, such as diet, hydration levels, and overall health. It’s crucial to always drink plenty of water to flush the kidneys of waste, and if one is considering a kidney cleanse, it is even more important.”\n\nIf you suspect that may be the case with your organs, you can tune into your body for signals. The following signs may indicate that your kidneys are stressed and can do with a detox (3):\n\n* Changes in urine frequency or color\n\nA study was conducted on 10,521 participants aged 20 and older to understand the prevalence of kidney stones in the United States. The study found that 11% of the participants had kidney stones. It was further noted that 2.1% of the participants had experienced kidney stones or 2,054 cases per 100,000 adults in a year.\n\nIf you experience one or more of these, you may consider your options for a kidney flush. So, how do you do a kidney flush? And how to detox your kidneys? Let’s see.\n\nAs mentioned before, there is no evidence regarding any particular kidney cleanse diet. So, instead of a diet plan for any particular number of days, here you can find some of the best things you can do that may help flush your kidneys and support their functioning.\n\nIf you’re searching for “what is the fastest way to flush your kidneys?” here is your answer. Every single organ requires water to function, and the kidneys are no exception. With filtration as the primary role, kidneys require water to make urine, which is what carries toxins and wastes out of the body. A low urine volume is linked with kidney dysfunction, including the formation of kidney stones (4). The standard recommended amount of water for daily intake is around 4L for males and 3.1L for females (5). If you have not been meeting this requirement, you can focus on achieving this standard during your kidney cleanse and make it part of your daily routine.\n\nMost berries are rich in antioxidants and phytochemicalsi  XChemical compounds found in vegetables and fruits that help combat cell damage and inflammation present in kidney cells. and may have a protective effect on kidney cells by fighting off inflammation and oxidative stress (6). For a kidney cleanse, the two most talked about are blueberries and cranberries.\n\nAccording to an animal study, blueberries can help regulate blood pressure and improve glucose tolerance. While human studies are warranted, you may benefit from including blueberries in your diet as kidney diseases are positively linked with both high blood sugar and high blood pressure (7). Blueberries are also low in potassium, sodium, and phosphorus, three minerals that tend to make things difficult for kidneys if you have them in large quantities (8),-9,-10, (11).  Cranberries have been found to soothe the urinary tract and may prevent infections (12).\n\nGrapes contain flavonoidsi  X A group of chemical compounds present in plants that protect against oxidative damage and reduce kidney inflammation. which are beneficial plant compounds. One of them known as resveratrol has been found to be effective in lowering kidney inflammation in an animal study (13), (14). Although human studies are warranted for more insight into how grapes can benefit kidney function, it is a great choice to satisfy your sweet tooth while getting a load of micronutrients.\n\n4. Get Your Vitamin B6 Through Food Or Supplements\n\nVitamin B6 is an essential micronutrient that your body uses in various metabolic reactions, including the metabolism of glyoxylate. When B6 is deficient, instead of turning into glycine, glyoxylate turns into oxalate— a substance with an association with the formation of kidney stones (15). You can add a B-complex vitamin supplement that has more than or equal to 50 milligrams (but less than 100 milligrams) of B6. Alternatively, you can get it through food sources such as carrots, milk, ricotta cheese, avocado, bananas, salmon, and chicken (16).\n\nIf you’re still looking for how to flush your kidneys, just eat more omega-3 fatty acids to balance out excessive omega-6 fatty acids. This is because high levels of omega-6 have been linked with the risk of kidney stones. Besides, omega-3s may also lower your risk of passing protein through urine, a condition known as proteinuria. The two most important omega 3-s are docosahexaenoic acid or DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid or EPA. You can take a high-quality fish oil supplement or include fatty fish like salmon, albacore tuna, anchovies, and mackerel. Flax seeds and oysters are other good sources of omega-3s (17), (18).\n\nWatermelons contain plenty of water, fibers, and amazing nutrients that may protect your kidneys from damage. For instance, lycopenei  X A color pigment that gives red and pink colors to fruits and vegetables and helps prevent cell damage and improve kidney function. , a compound in watermelons, was shown to lower inflammation in rats with existing kidney damage. Watermelons may also help to balance the levels of phosphate, oxalate, citrate, and calcium in your body (19), (20).\n\nSimilarly, pomegranate, a potassium-rich fruit, can be a beneficial fruit to add to a kidney cleanse diet. Potassium may reduce the risk of kidney stones and help to flush out toxins and waste from the kidneys (17).\n\nBoth watermelon and pomegranate have high levels of potassium, and should not be overconsumed during a kidney cleanse. Potassium is among the minerals that the kidney finds difficult to clear if its functionality is impaired (9).\n\nLemons and oranges contain citrate, or vitamin C, a nutrient that has been associated with kidney stone prevention. It plays that role by binding with excess calcium and preventing the formation of calcium crystals (17). Vitamin C is also a powerful antioxidant and may prevent tissue damage (21). There is some evidence to suggest that vitamin C may improve insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels, and blood vessel health— all of which can benefit your kidney function (22),-23, (7). Additionally, lemons and oranges can help you increase your total fluid intake. Dr. Michael adds, “The citric acid in lemons helps break down and dissolve kidney stones, which is helpful for cleansing the kidneys. Additionally, lemon water helps flush out toxins and waste products from the body.”\n\n8. Juice Beetroots Or Add Them To Your Salad\n\nBeets contain a compound called betaine which may help to increase the acidity of your urine, which can benefit your urinary tract. It may also prevent the buildup of calcium and struvite (a compound produced by bacteria in the body) and lower your risk of getting kidney stones (24), (25).\n\nIf you have to choose one herbal tea for kidneys, it should be dandelion tea. That’s because dandelion has been used in traditional medicine as a kidney tonic. A tea made with fresh dandelion root or dried dandelion may help you cleanse your kidneys. Additionally, it is known to stimulate bile production which can improve digestion and thus reduce the volume of waste that reaches the kidneys (26), (27). However, consume it in moderation to avoid side effects. Consult a doctor to get a recommended dosage before including it in your diet.\n\n10. Limit Your Intake Of Oxalic Acid, Sodium, And Added Sugar\n\nToo much salt and sugar in the diet are linked with high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Each of these conditions can put your kidneys in jeopardy (28). So, if you are doing a kidney cleanse, give table salt and processed sugar a break.\n\nOxalic acid is an organic acid that is toxic to humans in large quantities. Oxalic acid-rich foods like spinach, and dark chocolate can increase the amount of oxalate in the blood. Oxalate is linked with kidney stone formation, so you need to be careful about how much you are putting in your body (29).\n\nAmla or Indian gooseberry is a rich source of phenolic compounds and antioxidants that help exert a protective effect against kidney damage. Research suggests that amla may help prevent acute kidney dysfunction and age-related renal dysfunction. In an animal study, amla extract was found to prevent fibrosisi  XThickening or scarring of connective tissue as the result of the body’s response to injury or damage. , oxidative stress, and inflammation related to kidney dysfunction (30).\n\nYou can find packaged amla juice in health stores. Alternatively, you can obtain fresh amla juice by blending the fruit after removing its pit.\n\nNote: Avoid amla juice unless instructed otherwise by your healthcare provider if you have kidney issues.\n\nIt may seem strange to find this on a kidney cleanse guide. However, it is essential to sleep well while you flush your kidneys as your sleep-wake cycle regulates the workload and functioning of your kidneys (31).\n\nApple cider vinegar (ACV) has been recognized for its potential health benefits, and recent research has explored its protective effects on kidney health. In an animal study, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was used to induce oxidative damage in rats’ kidneys, leading to elevated urea, creatinine, sodium, and potassium ion levels. It was seen that apple cider vinegar significantly reduced these levels. Moreover, ACV treatment helped mitigate kidney damage, particularly hemorrhagic lesions. These findings suggest that apple cider vinegar may potentially protect against kidney impairment and associated dysfunction (32). However, further research is warranted in this area to understand its efficacy in promoting kidney health in humans.\n\nNote: Always consult your health care professional before attempting any kidney flushes, particularly if you have any kidney problems.\n\nIn a nutshell, your kidneys are hardworking and self-cleaning organs. They do well as long as they are not exposed to excessive environmental or dietary toxins. Fatigue, swollen ankles, and low urine volume are some signs of kidney stress. Detoxifying or flushing your kidneys needs you to be mindful of what you eat and how much water you drink. Cranberries, watermelon, lemon, and fatty fish are commonly recommended for kidney-flush diets. However, bear in mind that there is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness or safety of kidney flushing. Hence, consult your doctor before you use any remedies.\n\nWhat herb is good for cleansing kidneys?\n\nAccording to Dr. Michael, “Herbs that are good for cleansing the kidneys include dandelion root, nettle leaf, marshmallow root, juniper berries, ginger root, yarrow leaf and flower, and sage herb.”\n\nNo, beer may cause more frequent urination, but that is not the same as a kidney “flush”. On the contrary, beer or any other alcoholic beverage consumed in excess puts strain on the kidneys, can impair their functioning, and cause kidney damage.\n\nHow do doctors flush your kidneys?\n\nDoctors may use diureticsi  XWater pills that help remove sodium and water from the body through the kidneys and increase urine production. to flush out the kidneys and remove toxin buildup.\n\nKidneys are self-cleaning organs that may also be able to regenerate and repair themselves," depending on the extent of the damage.\n\nLearn how to heal and cleanse your kidneys with easy tips!

This implies parent-child relationships can sometimes become complex. Some children may grow up feeling disconnected from their parents. In addition,,,, or physical. Research says that even neglect is a kind of child abuse (1). Parental neglect can make a child feel very isolated.\n\nIf both parents are working or busy with their lives, neglecting the children’s needs, a rift may form between them and their children. Emotional unavailability is another form of neglect, which can make the children feel estranged from their parents. If you have abused or neglected your child, they might feel angry, resentful, and bitter towards you.\n\nChild abuse and neglect can lead to psychological issues, such as depression, low self-esteem, and difficulty in maintaining relationships. The abused child often feels isolated, fearful, and distrustful. Children can also develop attachment disorders due to abuse and neglect, which hinders their ability to form healthy peer and social and romantic relationships. They are also more likely to develop antisocial traits as they grow up.\n\nA consistent difference in opinions and values due to the generational gap may lead the children to grow apart from their parents and cause a communication breakdown. Political opinions, gender rights, career expectations, and age-old values are common grounds for differences in opinions between children and their parents. It is how we communicate differences that matter. We can validate others without agreeing with their viewpoint.\n\nWhen the values are not aligned, conflict can arise. If your child believes they cannot openly discuss their opinions with you, this is a sign there is already a fracture. You perhaps were emotionally disapproving or dismissing.\n\nBeing controlling or coercive towards your children is another type of abuse. If the child feels too constrained by their parents, they may grow distant from family and relatives. Parents who control their children’s freedom and overall life hinder the child’s personal growth and experience.\n\nForcing your child to stay home or do things they are not interested in will take them away from you. You need to give them enough space to hang out with their friends, participate in extracurricular activities, and do the things that they love. It is about finding balance as our children mature and develop. Creating and maintaining a healthy hierarchy is essential. If this is set into place from the beginning, we increase the likelihood of our children respecting and trusting us. When respect and trust are present, our children are more likely to listen to us.\n\nIf parents do not support something their child loves, it may cause a tear in the relationship. This resentment may grow over the years if not dealt with soon. It is important for parents to support their children’s hobbies, likes, dreams, and interests. Even if the parent does not agree with their children’s passion or opinion, showing support goes a long way in building a strong relationship.\n\nA lack of support can fracture emotional safety and emotional connection. Supporting your child can help foster a deeper relationship, provided that the interests, passions, and pastimes do not revolve around unsafe pursuits. Finding ways to support your child can be challenging when a lack of empathy is brought on by basic differences in beliefs.\n\nPlacing your child in an unsafe environment may cause cracks in your relationship with them. This could be a one-time instance, or the kind of people you let into your house may be unsafe for your child.\n\nAn example of an unsafe environment is residential instability – you constantly change houses. If you move around a lot, your child might feel less connected to the house and parents. The same goes for the environment inside the house. If one of the parents is an alcoholic or abusive, the children are less likely to bond with them.\n\nAs humans, we need stability and structure to know that our lives will offer safety and reliability. Children crave this and it is essential to their overall development.\n\nOther unsafe environments include constantly changing your children’s care-givers, keeping your children with physically, verbally, or sexually abusive relatives or friends, or forcing your children to visit schools or parks where they are constantly bullied.\n\nSome families hold their children to unrealistic expectations, which often makes the kids depleted and resentful. Forcing your children to take up a particular course of life or job that they don’t like may lead them away from you. The parents may expect the child to follow their political, gender, religious, and cultural views, which the child may not agree with. This burden of expectations can create a gap between the child and their parents.\n\nThe emotional equation for disappointment is expectation minus reality. Not all expectations will be met in our relationships. However, dialoguing early and finding areas of compromise is beneficial to the relationship.\n\nInstead of discussing the difference of opinions and showing support and love, if the parents brush them away, it will make the child resentful towards them. Your child may think your opinions are outdated, so forcing them to submit will lead to estrangement.\n\nMental health issues can often lead children away from their parents. If parents don’t understand or accept mental issues, it becomes difficult for the children to communicate with them.\n\nSome parents take the ‘tough love’ route, forcing the child to deal with their mental struggles incorrectly instead of seeking professional help. If a child is bullied at school, some parents may think they need to go through that bullying to ‘be a man’. This may impact the child’s mental state even more and negatively affect the parent-child relationship. Understanding your emotional philosophy as a parent and knowing how this influences emotional safety can increase your awareness of how responding like this affects the parent-child relationship.\n\nWitnessing traumatic events, such as sexual assault, abuse, or alcoholic parents, may lead children to separate from the family. If the child tries to share their traumatic experience with the parents and they invalidate their emotions or refuse to accept, it causes a rift between them. This can have a devastating lifelong impact on your child’s psychological, emotional, mental, and physical health.\n\nWhen parents get divorced, the children may fall apart from one or both of the parents. If the child views one of the parents as the reason for the divorce, they might find that parent the “bad-one” who disrupted their family. Also, if a parent remarries after divorce, it may cause an estranged relationship with the child if they do not like the new partner. These family dynamics may affect the child’s mental health deeply.\n\nSometimes, a child may feel unfairly treated by their parents if they show favoritism towards another child. This may lead the child to think that the parent prefers the other child over them. If the parents always side with one child during an argument, the other may resent their sibling and the parents. While this might not be a conscious thing that parents do purposely, it still affects the child.\n\nDemanding careers make it challenging for grown kids to maintain a close relationship with their parents. They have to devote most of their time towards their goals, which in this fast-paced life leaves little time and energy to pursue familial matters actively. Geographical distance exacerbates the issue, where parents and children who live in different states and countries cannot meet and spend time with each other on weekends and holidays.\n\nWhile this may be an unavoidable hindrance in the relationship between grown children and their parents, open communication and understanding can help both parties bridge the gap. Organizing virtual meetings from time to time, and talking to them over the phone or messaging them ever so often can help maintain and keep the relationship strong.\n\nHere are a few signs that indicate your child is growing apart from you.\n\n* Break Of Contact: If your child doesn’t communicate with you either in person or over call, it can be a sign of estrangement. No matter how much you try to connect with your child if they do not respond, it indicates they do not feel connected with you. Also, if your child contacts you once a month with barely anything to say or share, may be they are ignoring you politely.\n\n* No Interest In Family Events: If your child refuses to participate in family functions, they may be trying to stay away from you. This will cause a rift between your child and your relatives in the long run.\n\n* Communicate More With Relatives Than You: If you are getting more information about your child from a relative rather than the child telling you, it is clear they may be ignoring you. If your child is not telling you about their achievements, new accomplishments, or big events in their life, they don’t feel connected with you.\n\n* No Meetings: Your child may outrightly refuse to meet you, or they may constantly come up with excuses to not meet you. This is a clear sign that they are ignoring you. They might make time to meet other relatives, siblings, or friends, but they don’t make it a point to meet you. Even if they come to meet you, it’s only for a very short period. It could be that your child has set boundaries for the relationship but has not verbally communicated to you.\n\nAre you wondering if your child is ignoring you or they are just busy? Read the next section to understand how often adult children usually talk to their parents.\n\nChildren in the launching stage of the family life cycle are now at the age where they are in the process of moving from living at home to forming their own identities and transitioning into living independently. Some adult children may speak to their parents at least daily or every alternate days. But this is mostly true for college kids rather than working adults. The frequency with which adult children contact their parents depends on their needs, schedules, and leisure.\n\nAdult children with jobs, responsibilities, and families (spouse and children) may not call often. However, if your child keeps in touch with you and shares information about their lives, it implies they are not ignoring you. It can be an indicator that the relationship is healthy.\n\nNow that you know the clear signs your child is ignoring you, here are a few ways to help you cope with it.\n\nApologize: A great first step is to process regrets with your child together and apologize for them. This allows them the opportunity to also process their resentments. Most of the time, parents refuse to apologize to their children. But an apology can go a long way in rebuilding your relationship with your kid. It is important to back your apology with actions. If your child thinks you are just all words but no action, it might worsen the situation.\n\nRelated: How To Apologize To Your Boyfriend Listen: Instead of getting your child to listen to your opinion, listen to theirs. Being a good listener is more than just active listening. Listen to understand them deeply, empathize, and validate. Don’t interrupt them when they speak. Hear them out with an open mind. Talk to them about the things you don’t understand and listen to their answers. Accept: It is important for a child to know that their parents accept them for who they are. So, be more accepting and supportive towards your children. Try to accept people your child loves and things they are interested in.\n\nBebe Nicholson, a blogger, shared how her sons celebrate Mother’s Day with their wives and how she understands why it is important. She wrote, “My sons like to make sure their wives have a good Mother’s Day, and I realize they are in the trenches taking care of my grandchildren. One of my daughters-in-law likes to visit her mother on Mother’s Day, and since they live hundreds of miles away, this doesn’t lead to any jealous vibes from me (i).”\n\nRespect: Respect is earned; it is not given. You have to respect your child’s opinions to earn respect for yourself. Just because they are younger than you does not mean they have to listen to you and follow your beliefs. Your views on respect may differ from those of your child. Understanding their point of view could help in “earning” their respect in the long run, even though you may not necessarily agree with it. Do Not Exert Pressure: Stop pressurizing your child to do things they don’t want to. This includes education, career, and marriage. Don’t force them to talk to you as well. Just because you are their parent, it doesn’t entitle you to their respect and conversation. It has to be earned, and you need to be there for them. Seek Professional Help: If you have mental health issues causing the tear with your child, you need to seek help. If your child is experiencing mental health issues, try to find a specialist who can explain your child’s situation to you. If your child is comfortable, get them to speak to a family therapist. Let Go: Sometimes, you have to realize that the bridge is burned. Your child has their own life now, and you have to let go of them. Forcing your way into your child’s life may work temporarily, but it often increases the rift. However, let them know that you are there if they ever want to talk or need anything, and just let them be. If your child continues to set boundaries and makes the decision to limit you in their life, use this opportunity to work on yourself to gain perspective on your unhealthy patterns that may have caused the strain in the relationship.\n\nThe next section will answer how soon you can expect to reconcile with your estranged child and what factors decide how long you will be kept cut off from their lives.\n\nSome estrangements may last for a few weeks to months. Some may be more serious, lasting for several years, depending on the cause of the estrangement. It also depends on what you do to make your child believe you want to repair the relationship. If you aren’t doing anything, it may never get repaired.\n\nParents need to take the first step and show support to rebuild the relationship. Don’t expect your child to make the first move; you do it. This will make your child realize that you are serious about them and go a long way in developing a strong and secured bond.\n\nWhat is the most psychologically damaging thing you can say to a child?\n\nThere are several psychologically damaging things that parents can say to a child. But most importantly, “I don’t love you” or saying nothing at all seriously hurts your child.\n\nHow do you deal with a disrespectful grown daughter?\n\nEngage with your daughter, acknowledge the mistake or hurt you may have caused, and also learn to set boundaries; these may help deal with a disrespectful grown daughter.\n\nHow do you let go of a child who hates you?\n\nTry to listen to your child, letting them know how much love you have," and also try to change yourself to avoid the same mistake (if you begin communicating again).\n\nDiscover insights and unveil the compelling reasons your grown kids might harbor deep resentment towards you.

S. health care workers with swine flu found that many didn't do enough to protect themselves against the virus.\n\nResearchers focused on 13 nurses and other health care workers who were likely infected at work in the early days of the U. S. outbreak. They found that only half always wore gloves,,,, especially if - as some fear - the virus mutates into a deadlier form.\n\nThe study is being published this week in a CDC publication, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\nThe 80 cases of health care workers is out of the nearly 18,000 confirmed and probable U. S. cases reported as of last Friday. Those numbers suggest health care workers are underrepresented in the case counts, CDC officials said.\n\nAbout 1,600 people have been hospitalized and at least 44 died, according to CDC numbers. Many of the victims were younger adults, children and people with other illnesses. About 40 percent of those hospitalized have been people with asthma, diabetes, heart disease and other medical conditions, said Dr. Daniel Jernigan, a CDC flu expert.\n\nWidespread cases in 17 states - particularly in the Northeast - suggest swine flu will continue through July and August and into the fall and winter, he said.\n\nIn some earlier flu pandemics, the new virus essentially elbowed out other flu strains. It's likely that swine flu will circulate along with seasonal flu bugs in the fall, Jernigan said.\n\n©2009 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The third place match will be played on Saturday.\n\nSee an AP story below.\n\nAguero: Brazil Collapse Can Happen to Anyone\n\nBELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) — Germany’s 7-1 thrashing of five-time champion Brazil has left no doubt among Argentina’s players about the challenge they face in the World Cup final on Sunday. Striker Sergio Aguero says he and his Argentine teammates obviously took notice of the rout.“Germany is a great team. What happened to Brazil could happen to any team,” he said.But, Aguero added, the Germans also have reason to be concerned, “knowing that we have players who can create danger up front — We’re in the final for a reason.”After injuring his left thigh in Argentina’s last group-stage match against Nigeria, the Manchester City striker was sidelined for two knockout games before going on as a substitute in the semifinal Wednesday against the Netherlands. He failed to have an impact in the attack but scored the third penalty in Argentina’s 4-2 shootout win.“When you come back from injury, in the back of your mind you are worried about it happening again,” Aguero said. “When you miss three matches in a World Cup with the rhythm the guys have you realize you are lacking something.“But if I get called up to play in the final I will try to find the energy from wherever to do it as well as possible.”Argentina hadn’t advanced beyond the quarterfinals since the 1990 World Cup, so the country is euphoric about the team’s success in Brazil.Unlike Germany, Argentina has advanced with single-goal margins against its opponents and couldn’t score before the shootout against the Netherlands. Four years ago in South Africa, Argentina lost 4-0 to Germany in the quarterfinals.“At this point who is favorite, who is not, it doesn’t make a difference,"” midfielder Maxi Rodriguez said. “Both teams feel a responsibility to go all the way. We’re going to do our part to make it.”	P	2024-02-11 22:10:33	2024-02-11 22:18:42",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, not doing so can have serious consequences. One study of more than 20,200 Norwegian married couples, published in 2015 in BMC Public Health, showed that rates of divorce are significantly higher among couples in which one partner experiences some form of mental distress, such as depression, than in couples in which neither partner experiences mental distress.\n\nHere are five signs that depression is taking a toll on your relationship (plus, five tips for lessening its impact).\n\nAnhedonia — loss of interest, enjoyment, or pleasure in things once enjoyed — is a hallmark symptom of depression, according to Cleveland Clinic.\n\nIf you have depression, the condition can affect all parts of your life, including activities you used to find fun and that once made you happy, per Cleveland Clinic. This can be difficult for some partners without depression to understand.\n\n“If the couple usually enjoys going out together for movies, dinner, time with mutual friends, and one partner withdraws from these activities because of depression, it may become a point of contention for the other partner,” says Stacey Neal, MD, a psychiatrist at Kaiser Permanente in Baltimore.\n\nDepression is linked to low self-esteem and self-criticism, according to Mayo Clinic. It can make some people with the condition feel like there’s something wrong with them, and that other people around them — including their partner — are judging them, explains Dr. Lira de la Rosa. As a result, some people with depression may also question whether their partner truly wants to be in a relationship with them, he adds.\n\n“Some partners may internalize that something is wrong with them and may feel that their partner does not find them desirable,” says Lira de la Rosa. “This can translate to them spending a lot of time alone and perhaps saying no to their partner when they would like to do some activities together.”\n\nSome people with depression may become withdrawn, even from family and loved ones, according to Mayo Clinic.\n\n“For instance, this can lead to someone with depression not sharing with their partner that they are going through a tough time or asking for support from their partner,” says Lira de la Rosa. “As a result, the other person in the relationship may not be aware of what is happening or know how to best support their partner.”\n\nHaving support from loved ones can be a key part of managing depression, and becoming isolated from others can worsen your symptoms, according to Mayo Clinic.\n\nWhile all couples have conflict — and some conflict can be healthy, experts say — conflicts tend to happen more frequently among couples in which one partner has depression. Research shows that many people with depression have more negative interactions than positive interactions with their spouse or partner, compared with people without depression.\n\nOne potential reason: Heightened irritability and sensitivity are common symptoms of depression. Sometimes in relationships, these symptoms can cause issues that may seem small or innocuous to one partner — like playful teasing, for example — to be misconstrued by the partner with depression, says Dr. Neal.\n\nAnother common type of misunderstanding, which Lira de la Rosa often sees among his patients, has to do with not knowing the best ways to support each other. For instance, the partner with depression might feel that their partner doesn’t check in on them in ways that they find helpful, or that their partner doesn’t care. “When in reality, the other partner may have tried to check in and offer support and it was rejected,” says Lira de la Rosa.\n\n“This then creates a cycle of someone feeling that they are not getting the support they need, but they may not see that their behavior and emotions may push supportive people away,” he adds.\n\nIf you find that depression is hindering your sex life, you’re not alone. Depression leads to sexual dysfunction in almost 83 percent of women and 63 percent of men with the condition, research shows.\n\nThis can happen for several reasons, including symptoms such as fatigue and lack of energy. What’s more, certain antidepressants can weaken sex drive, cause erectile dysfunction, or make it difficult to reach orgasm, per Mayo Clinic.\n\nIf depression is negatively affecting your sex life, it can pose several challenges for a relationship. Sexual problems may be something you find distressing, which in turn may exacerbate your depressive symptoms. Or, for instance, some partners may not understand why sex has dwindled and could feel confused or even hurt as a result.\n\nRELATED: How to Have a Healthy Sex Life if Depression Is Getting in the Way\n\nWhile living with depression can feel overwhelming, the good news is that there are steps people can take to feel better, which can in turn help improve romantic relationships too. These five tips can help.\n\nOne of the best ways to lessen the effects of depression on your relationship is to make sure your symptoms are treated. For your best chance at symptom relief, it’s important to be consistent with your treatment (or seek treatment from a mental health professional, if you haven’t already). Psychotherapy and medication are the most common and effective treatments for depression, according to Mayo Clinic.\n\nLearning and practicing healthy communication skills, such as being honest with each other in respectful ways, validating each other’s feelings, and finding compromise, can help couples address their challenges together, according to The JED Foundation, a nonprofit geared toward improving emotional health and preventing suicide among teens and young adults.\n\nBy going to therapy or counseling together, couples can learn how to address depressive symptoms and any other issues together as a team, per The Family Institute at Northwestern University. It’s also a great way to learn and practice healthy communication skills.\n\nAs the saying goes, you can’t pour from an empty cup. Self-care (any activity you do to take care of yourself so that you can be healthy, well, and productive) is a key part of a healthy relationship, according to Love Is Respect, an intimate partner violence prevention organization. Regularly practicing self-care can help you feel better and allow you to be a more present partner, per McNulty Counseling and Wellness.\n\nAs noted earlier, there are several reasons that depression can put a strain on your sex life, including reduced sex drive, sexual dysfunction, and the side effects of antidepressants.\n\nIf you feel your depression is negatively affecting your sex life (and your relationship as a result), there are steps you can take to lessen its impact. For starters, it can help to tell your partner about what you’re going through and why your depression is impacting your sex drive, according to Mayo Clinic. And if both partners feel ready to be intimate again, it can help to start small and slow and gradually ease into it.\n\nIt can also help to talk to your doctor about what you’re experiencing, because they can help you narrow down the cause. For instance, if you take antidepressants and they’re causing sexual side effects that don’t go away, your doctor may opt to adjust your medication dose or switch you to a different antidepressant," per Mayo Clinic.

21727e43c53ea67574257d6d561f9502,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-02-breakthroughs-muscular-dystrophy.html#google_vignette,Vidal-Gadea|dystrophy|muscles|study|disease,,dystrophy,A new study by Illinois State University's Andrés Vidal-Gadea is breaking ground in the field of muscular dystrophy research.\n\nPublished Tuesday in Proceedings of The National Academy of Science of the United States of America,,,, also pioneered new methods of studying C. elegans in more natural environments, all with the aim of seeing if exercise produces long-term beneficial effects for muscular dystrophy patients.\n\nRather than just grown on top of a petri plate, as is tradition, we could watch them burrow, said Vidal-Gadea, an assistant professor of molecular neuroethology, who employs the worms in a variety of neurological studies. The new method brought out the phenotype of the disease—or led to the worms displaying the illness.\n\nStudents in the lab altered the exercise regime for worms to mimic different activities. Some C. elegans simply sat near food. Others swam to mirror high-frequency/low impact exercise such as jogging. Still others burrowed through gelatin to give the same effect as weight-lifting. Over time, worms that exercised built up muscles at different levels, but saw no change in the length of life or in the course of disease.\n\nIt's unfortunate, but our interpretation is that the exercise tested does not impact the course of the disease, said Vidal-Gadea.\n\nThe work touches close to home for Vidal-Gadea, who worked with patients with muscular dystrophy when he was an undergraduate student studying at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. At times, clients who would try different methods of exercise could end up worse off than when they started. That was brutal to see. They were trading their health for a chance to get better, but there is nothing in the literature that is conclusive about what helps, he said.\n\nThe failure is not in the exercise itself, but how the disease operates, noted Vidal-Gadea. He compared muscles to the engine of a car that provide force. You can build up the engine and gather more force, he said. But the problem isn't the engine, it's in how the force is transmitted. So just building muscles alone is like trying to put a Formula 1 engine into a little Volkswagen bug when the transmission is broken. You might just tear your car apart. Now, if you only look at some of the parameters like maximal RPMs of the engine, you may be led to believe that the treatment helped.\n\nThe three-year study will also help scientists better understand the chain of events when humans develop muscular dystrophy, and the symptoms that arise. We know that when people get muscular dystrophy, the gene is broken and muscles die, said Vidal-Gadea, but there are a lot of things that happen in between that we don't know. He added that piecing together the chain will give scientists a view into what damage is caused by the disease and what is sparked by the muscles trying to fight back.\n\nOne step along the chain Vidal-Gadea's team examined was the amount of calcium released in the muscles of those battling Duchenne muscular dystrophy. There is a build-up of calcium that is released when the muscles contract, said Vidal-Gadea. For those who have muscular dystrophy, the amount of calcium released can be notably higher. The study examined the changes in calcium as the worms moved. We can begin to see where and when the calcium in the muscles becomes dysregulated. This gives us potential targets to go after to make improvements for those with muscular dystrophy.\n\nEven more striking, in several cases, the students were able to prevent dystrophic animals from developing signs of sickness. It was very few cases, and the illness did not go away, but the C. elegans did not show any symptoms of it in their actions, said Vidal-Gadea. Our next steps will be to explore what chain of events might have led to the reversal.\n\nThe lab will continue to work with the help of NIH funding. Students involved include graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, along with collaboration with individuals at the University of Illinois and the Fred Hutch Center in Seattle, Washington. We use a wide array of techniques that can be complicated," said Vidal-Gadea. The work these students are doing is propelling them in terms of research and moving toward their goals of medical school or lab experience.

Many Russian politicians have a dark past, she said, as the final years of the Soviet Union were riddled with corruption and crime.\n\n“People came out here to defend their voting rights: We elected him, so return him to us,” she said.\n\nThe protests come barely three weeks after a landslide referendum victory for the Kremlin on amendments to the constitution, allowing Putin to remain in power for another 16 years. Dozens were arrested in Moscow last week after a few hundred protested against the amendments.\n\nLast Saturday, between 10,000-12,000 people took part in an unsanctioned march in Khabarovsk, the local branch of the interior ministry said in a statement. The city is a seven-hour flight east of the capital.\n\nThis Saturday, fewer than 10,000 marched, the city mayor’s office said in a statement," adding that the protest was peaceful and there were no detentions. Some local news outlets estimated the number was significantly higher.

Instead, he says, chronic nightmares are both trauma-induced and a learned behavior.\n\n[The new therapy] permits us and the patient to explore treating the nightmare directly, says Krakow.\n\nKrakow and his colleagues worked with 168 women, 95 percent of whom had moderate to severe PTSD. Ninety-seven percent had experienced rape or sexual assault; 77 percent also reported a life-threatening sexual assault, and 58 percent also had experienced repeated sexual abuse in childhood or adolescence.\n\nKrakow's team randomly divided the women into two groups of 80 and 88. The first group continued to receive whatever treatment they already were  getting, while the second group received three sessions of so-called imagery rehearsal therapy.\n\nDuring those sessions, which involved four to eight women at a time, therapists encouraged the women to recognize that their nightmares were trauma-induced and a learned behavior. In the first session, they were also coached in pleasant imagery exercises.\n\nOne week later, the women wrote about a single nightmare. The therapist told them to change anything they wanted about the nightmare, then to rehearse the new dream for 10 to 15 minutes. Once they left the session, the women had to rehearse the new dream for five to 20 minutes per day.\n\nIn the third session, the women discussed their progress with the group and asked questions about PTSD, nightmares and sleep.\n\nThree months after they started the program, the women were asked about the quality of  their sleep, frequency of nightmares and severity of PTSD symptoms. At the six-month mark, the women returned for a personal interview, where the researchers asked similar questions.\n\nGenerally speaking, people [were] able to reduce their nightmares anywhere from 50 to 80 percent, says Krakow. In some cases, the nightmares disappeared entirely, although the technique didn't work at all for some survivors.\n\nKrakow says most people who use the technique  usually will report fewer nightmares, less intense nightmares or a different attitude towards their dreams. Eventually, he says they may experience all three.\n\nRosalind Cartwright, who heads the psychology department at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago, says similar patterns of chronic nightmares also are  found in Holocaust survivors and Vietnam veterans.\n\nDreams of this kind tend to be repetitive and not self-resolving, says Cartwright. They don't just fade the way bad experiences usually do. You have no way of coping with it unless you have some focused program during the day.\n\nShe says image rehearsal therapy lets patients guide their nightmares to a better end, one without trauma.\n\nIn waking, he has them get a sense of control over that imagery.  It is a very focused kind of treatment, and very quick," says Cartwright.\n\nWhat To Do\n\nYou can visit Krakow's Center for Sleep Medicine and Nightmare Treatment or find out about nightmares from the Association for the Study of Dreams.\n\nABCNews.com also has this story on nightmare therapy.

S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed to disagree on Thursday about a Russian pipeline project that Washington opposes,,,, a decision that drew criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. But Biden said he and Merkel were united in their belief that Russia should not use energy as a geopolitical weapon.\n\n“Good friends can disagree,” he said about the pipeline during a joint news conference.\n\n“We stand together and will continue to stand together to defend our eastern-flank allies at NATO against Russian aggression.”\n\nMerkel noted the differences of opinion but emphasized points of unity between the two countries. “We all share the same values; we all share the same determination to tackle the challenges of our times,” she said.\n\n“There is a lot of common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor; that trade with China needs to rest on the assumption that we have a level playing field,” Merkel said.\n\nBut both leaders said they would stand up for democratic principles and universal rights when they saw China or any other country working to undermine them.\n\n“We are united, united in our commitment to addressing democratic backsliding, corruption, phony populism in the European Union or among candidates for the EU membership, or anywhere we find it in the world,” Biden said.\n\nBiden,78, and Merkel,66, do not have much time to strengthen ties between the world’s largest and fourth-largest economies.\n\nMerkel, chancellor since 2005, plans to exit Germany’s government after national elections in September. Polling shows her Christian Democrats are poised to take the lead in forming a government after the election, but it remains unclear which parties would be included in a coalition.\n\nBiden’s Democratic Party has tenuous majorities in the U. S. Congress that could evaporate in the 2022 congressional elections.\n\nJohn Emerson, who served as ambassador to Germany under former President Barack Obama, said the relationship remains “indispensable” for Washington given Germany’s role as the largest economy in Europe and a NATO ally, as well as its importance as a bridge builder in dealing with Russia, the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nGermany hosts some 36,000 U. S. troops on its soil.\n\nThe White House feted Merkel after the working visit between the two leaders.\n\nShe and her husband attended a dinner hosted by the Bidens with guests that included U. S. lawmakers, former secretaries of state Colin Powell and Hillary Clinton and the Republican leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate.\n\nThe White House said the menu included grilled peaches, crispy sea bass," and vanilla ice cream.

Editors have highlighted                                                     the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nClearer messaging on gambling harm is needed if the industry is to help customers moderate their gambling behavior,,,, says Professor Elliot Ludvig, professor of Psychology at the University of Warwick.\n\nThere's a clear formula on alcohol labels for example, that outlines how someone can moderate their alcohol intake. On tobacco labels, the warning is very stark, he continues. Safer gambling messages could take on a similar format. It should be obvious how gambling addiction can take hold of people. Clearer messaging would also create greater transparency around certain games, and how the wider industry works.\n\nDuring the randomized online experiment, academics created an online roulette game and gave participants a real sum of £5, which they could choose to either withdraw and keep, or continue with the experiment and gamble the money.\n\nA total of 1,500 people took part in the roulette game experiment and were divided into three groups. One group played the game where the Take Time to Think slogan was displayed at all times in the background; one group where the slogan was displayed in the background but also appeared prominently as a pop-up window, and the player needed to close the window in order to keep playing; and a third group where the slogan was completely absent.\n\nDuring the experiment, researchers measured people's gaming susceptibility, i.e., how much individuals would normally play casino games, as well as the number of spins, how much money each person bet at a time, and how quickly they bet.\n\nThe messaging had little to no effect on people's gambling behavior, said Lukasz Walasek, associate professor of Psychology at the University of Warwick and co-author of the study. The study did not reliably change the amount people bet, and it certainly didn't have the intended effect of reducing the time spent gambling. Whether or not they received the message, people spent similar amounts of time placing each bet, made similar numbers of roulette spins, and played for a similar length of time overall.\n\nAcademics at the University of Warwick previously studied the Betting and Gaming Council's When the Fun Stops, Stop awareness message, which was also found to have no credible impact on people's betting behavior and even had the opposite desired effect in some instances. During that experiment, when the message was present," it was found that people were slightly more likely to bet all their available money.

Colour derives from the spectrum of light interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities the light receptors [1, 2].\n\nA dye is nothing but a coloured substance that has an affinity to the substrate to which it is being applied. The dye is applied in an aqueous solution and needs a mordant to boost the fastness of the dye on the textile fibre. The pigment may be a material that modifies the colour of mirrored or transmitted light as the result of wavelength-selective absorption. Pigments are used for colouring paint, ink, plastic, fabric, cosmetics, food and other materials.\n\nBoth dyes and pigments appear to be coloured as a result of absorption of some wavelengths of light more than others. However, there are some basic differences between the dyes and pigmentsThe major difference between the dyes and the pigments is that particle size of pigments is much higher as compared to dyes. Due to this small particle size dyes are not UV stable whereas pigments are UV stable. Dyes after dissolving in liquid are absorbed on the material while pigments make a suspension with a liquid that bonds with the material surface.Dyes are generally soluble in water while pigments are almost insoluble in water.Most of the dyes are organic while most of the pigments are inorganicDyes are available in large number in the market while the number of pigments is very less.Dyes impart colour by selective adsorption while pigments adsorb colour either by selective adsorption or by scattering of light.Dyes are combustible while pigments are non-combustible.Dyes have a short lifetime in comparison to pigments.\n\nOver the years, man has used colouring matters, which are known as dyes and pigments, for their aesthetic qualities and used them to embellish various articles and the world in which he lived. Indigo, the oldest known dye, was discovered in India; Tyrian purple (or Royal Purple) was discovered in the ancient city of Tyre; Alizarin was discovered among the Turks; and Cochineal was discovered among European and Mexican dyers [3]. Indigenous dye-yielding plants have been discovered in almost every area of the world. The first synthetic dyes were found in the early twentieth century. Parenteral administration was not formulated until the 1930s: methylene blues and methyl violet, for example, were used to treat leprosy and filariasis, respectively [4]. Following World War II, the use of intravenous dyes for medicinal purposes decreased rapidly. Just a few dyes, such as patent blue V or fluorescein, are still used as diagnostic drugs today [5].\n\nThe textile industry now uses more synthetic dyes. Coal tar and petroleum-based intermediates are the two main sources of these chemicals. Powders, granules, pastes, and liquid dispersions are all available [6, 7]. Active ingredient concentrations usually vary from 20 to 80 percent. The textile dye segment is distinguished by the introduction of new dyes. These new dyes are produced on a regular basis to meet the demands of new technologies, new types of fabrics, detergents, and developments in dyeing machinery, as well as to address the significant environmental issues posed by some existing dyes [8,9, 10]. With the rapid shift in the textile industry’s product profile, from high-cost cotton textiles to durable and flexible synthetic fibres, the pattern of dye use is also shifting rapidly. Polyesters now account for the majority of dye use. Disperse dyes, which are used in Polyesters, are expected to expand at a faster pace as a result. Textile dyestuffs may be grouped into the following groups for better comprehension if general dye chemistry is used as one of the classification criteria as acid dyes, direct dyes, azoic dyes, disperse dyes, sulphur dyes, reactive dyes, basic dyes, oxidation dyes, mordant dyes (chrome dyes) and vat dyes [11,12,13,14," 15].

Brett McGurk, the Obama administration’s diplomatic point man in the international fight against the Islamic State group, told journalists in Jordan that the tide was turning against extremists.“This perverse caliphate is shrinking,” said McGurk, a presidential envoy to the 66-member anti-ISIS coalition.In the past month, ISIS has lost a swath of key territory along a supply route in Iraq’s vast western Anbar province that the extremists had used to ferry fighters and supplies between Iraq and Syria. But after losing territory along the Euphrates River valley, that line has been cut, according to Iraqi and coalition officials.As ISIS militants are pushed back along front lines, the group is increasingly turning to insurgency-style terrorist attacks to detract from their losses, the officials said.However, despite battlefield successes against ISIS, Iraq’s political leadership is in disarray as a deepening political crisis has gridlocked government. Parliament has not met for more than two weeks after supporters of influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr stormed Baghdad’s highly fortified Green Zone. The breach followed repeated delays to government reform legislation that lawmakers claimed would fight Iraq’s entrenched corruption.“It’s possible that some of the political unrest in Baghdad has led (the Islamic State group) to think that they can somehow stir up more chaos than usual,” said Nathaniel Rabkin, managing editor of Inside Iraqi Politics, a political risk assessment newsletter.\n\n“ISIS hopes that somehow if they just keep up the pressure, the Iraqi government will at best collapse or at least become incapable of pursuing a cohesive approach” to fighting the extremists, Rabkin said. While the U.S.-led coalition acknowledges the planning phase of Iraqi military operations against ISIS has been slowed by political unrest, Rabkin says there is no evidence ISIS terrorist attacks have had a direct impact on the military campaign against the extremists.Besides the assault on the gas plant, Sunday’s attacks included a car bomb at a shopping area in the town of Latifiyah, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) south of the capital, that killed seven people, including two soldier, officials said. Eighteen people were wounded in the attack, four of whom were soldiers.Elsewhere in Baghdad, three separate bomb attacks targeted commercial areas, killing at least eight civilians and wounding 28 others, police said. At total of 29 people were killed in the day’s violence.Medical officials confirmed the casualty figures. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information.ISIS extremists still control significant areas in northern and western Iraq," including the country’s second-largest city of Mosul. The group declared an Islamic caliphate on the territory it holds in Iraq and Syria and at the height of its power was estimated to hold nearly a third of Iraqi territory. Iraq’s Prime Minister says the group’s hold has since shrunk to 14 percent.

S. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),,,, led by researchers from the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, highlights the need for efforts to better understand and improve poor health outcomes among low-income Americans.\n\nIt is important to note that our study does not examine cause-and-effect and whether or not SNAP participation itself increases the risk of mortality, said Zach Conrad, Ph. D., M.P.H., former postdoctoral fellow in nutritional epidemiology at the Friedman School and corresponding author. Rather, our investigation demonstrates that Americans on SNAP are dying at higher rates, emphasizing the need for strong efforts to improve their health. It is plausible that these individuals, if they did not participate in SNAP, might have even worse health outcomes.\n\nThe findings were published in the American Journal of Public Health on Jan. 19.\n\nTo investigate disparities in mortality risk according to both SNAP eligibility and participation, a team led by Conrad and senior study author Dariush Mozaffarian, M. D., Dr.P.H., dean of the Friedman School, analyzed health data on 499,741 U.S. adults aged 25 or older from the 2000 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey. These data—based on in-home, interviewer-administered questionnaires that assessed a broad range of participant characteristics, including SNAP participation—were linked to all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality data maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provided follow-up through 2011.\n\nFor SNAP participants, the observed increases in total and cardiovascular mortality were seen in both Whites and Blacks, but much less so in Hispanics. The exception was diabetes-related mortality, which was similarly high across all races and ethnicities participating in SNAP.\n\nWhen the researchers controlled for differences in age, gender, body mass index, geographic region, insurance coverage, family structure, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity and hypertension, none of these factors appeared to explain the higher mortality.\n\nHowever, differences in education, employment and marital status (and, for stroke, physical activity) each partly reduced the disparities in mortality, suggesting that these factors may partly explain the differences in risk of death, say the authors.\n\nOur results suggest that the millions of low-income Americans who rely on SNAP for food assistance require even greater support to improve their health than they currently receive. Such efforts should be a priority for policymakers, said Mozaffarian, who is also the Jean Mayer Chair and Professor of Nutrition at the Friedman School. Mortality differences were consistent by age and gender, whereas racial and ethnic differences were more varied. This highlights the need for further careful investigation of the underlying drivers of the observed poor health, which can help guide improvements to the program.\n\nTo be eligible for SNAP, households must have incomes at or below 130 percent of the national poverty level. While numerous studies have shown that this disadvantaged population is more likely to have higher rates of obesity, cardiovascular risk factors and other health conditions, and insufficient health insurance coverage compared to nonparticipants, differences in mortality were previously poorly understood.\n\nMany sociocultural and lifestyle factors are linked to SNAP participation, and the authors suggest that one potential explanation for the observed disparities may be that individuals who perceive themselves to be at higher risk for poor health outcomes tend to participate in SNAP. Compared with nonparticipants, SNAP participants are more likely to have children or other family members with developmental delays or functional limitations, and are more likely to report forgoing medical care because of financial hardship, they write.\n\nThey suggest that modifications to SNAP provide a natural opportunity to improve the health of millions of Americans. A leading cause of poor health is suboptimal diet, and SNAP participants tend to have lower-diet quality than nonparticipants. Several previous modeling studies have estimated that altering financial incentives for different foods purchased by SNAP participants would improve diets and reduce cardiovascular disease and diabetes. State-level modifications to SNAP have demonstrated that providing financial incentives leads to increased consumption of fruits and vegetables. In addition, financial disincentives for purchasing unhealthy items, in particular sugar-sweetened beverages, have been proposed.\n\nSNAP is effective at reaching a population that is at increased risk of ill health. Given that approximately 15 percent of the U. S. population participates in this important food assistance program, it is a vital component of the nation's public health programming infrastructure, and strategies to improve the health of its participants must be prioritized," Conrad said.

I don’t know what is coming my way. Where will I go? How will I spend my days? Who will support my family?”\n\nTajik, a 22-year old data analyst working for a U. S. contractor helping Afghan businesses, had gotten the call on Sunday afternoon, informing her she had just 10 minutes to leave for the airport. She had been put on an evacuation list heading to the United States or Mexico—she was told nothing more. She did not have a visa in her passport.\n\nShe left a friend’s apartment in Kabul with just the clothes on her back, a knapsack, a laptop, and her phone.\n\n“My dreams and my plans, are all inside this small backpack,” she said.\n\nAs the Taliban swept into Kabul on Sunday after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country, bringing an end to a two-decade campaign in which the United States and its allies had tried to transform Afghanistan, Tajik and a group of Afghans working for U. S. media were rushed to the city’s international airport by their American friends.\n\nThe speed of the Afghan government’s collapse, the ensuing chaos, and the near-complete takeover of the country—just two weeks before the final pullout of the last U. S. and NATO troops—has shocked many in Afghanistan and beyond. For Afghan women, it raised fears that all they had achieved in women’s rights, the right to go to school and work, would be swiftly taken away.\n\nOn the way to the airport, Tajik looked out the window, taking in the last glimpses of Kabul streets, “filled with a scary silence.”\n\nThere was barely time to call her family in the western province of Herat, seized by the Taliban last week in the insurgents’ relentless sweep. Before the fall, Tajik had fled the city of Herat, the provincial capital and her hometown, for the Afghan capital, “with hope that Kabul would resist.”\n\n“But everything changed,” she said. “Everything collapsed in front of my eyes.”\n\nHer family did not object to her leaving even though, at 22, she was their breadwinner. That role brought her respect and pride—something the Taliban could take away. She also knew that by staying, she would become a liability for her loved ones—a young woman, educated at an international university, and working with foreigners.\n\n“When I left Herat I thought I cannot leave my family like this, but staying there I become a risk for them,” she said. If the Taliban found out, she is convinced “they will hurt my family.”\n\nBefore leaving Herat, she destroyed all evidence linking her with international organizations, including newspaper clippings. Apart from working as a U. S. contractor, in July she was also featured in a prominent U.S. paper.\n\n“I burned them, I buried them, and I left,” she said.\n\nOnce at the airport, she saw Afghans waiting desperately for a plane out, some breaking into tears. She was tired, she had not slept in three days. Rumors circulated that the planes may even be canceled. Others asked why there was no security and who would protect them.\n\n“The Taliban can come at any time,” she said, her voice faltering.\n\nSix hours passed. She heard shots ring out from the outside—was it the Taliban?\n\nFrom where she was, she could see a plane on the tarmac, but it wasn’t hers. A mad rush of men and women followed, people overtaking one another, desperate to get out. She watched from a cold steel bench, and for a moment, thought of the unknown that awaited her on the other side.\n\n“I might end up on the other side of the world, in a refugee camp. I have no food, no money with me,” she said. And she missed her family. “I am worried for their lives,” she said. “All these years of education and hard work, in the hope of making a better life and helping other Afghans ended up being for nothing.”\n\nBy midnight on Sunday, she thought of giving up and taking a taxi back to Kabul. Herat was out of the question. She got up, but just as quickly changed her mind again.\n\nSleep would not come. She said looters were causing havoc inside the terminal. She left with her travel companions to wait outside on the runway.\n\nAt daybreak, thousands of Afghans had streamed into the airport. Tajik said she saw U. S. soldiers fire shots in the air. Her flight would be here soon, she was told.\n\nLater on Monday, U. S. military officials said the chaos at the Kabul airport had left seven people dead, including some who fell from a departing American military transport jet.\n\n“I will never forgive the world for staying silent,"” she said. “I didn’t deserve this. No one deserves this.”	P	2024-02-11 21:10:33	2024-02-12 00:58:49",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overweight children who were exposed to higher levels of PFCs tended to have higher concentrations of insulin and triglycerides in their blood, and these metabolic changes could signal the beginnings of the metabolic syndrome.\n\nThe cross-sectional study examined PFC exposure and metabolic changes in 499 third-graders. Researchers measured the participants' body mass index and waist circumference and analyzed blood samples for PFC, insulin, triglyceride and glucose levels. The samples were taken in 1997 as part of the European Youth Heart Study.\n\nThe analysis found that overweight children who had higher levels of certain PFCs in their blood were more likely to have higher levels of insulin and triglycerides as well. There was no relationship between PFC exposure and metabolic markers in normal-weight children.\n\nAlthough the two types of PFCs we investigated are being phased out due to health concerns, the use of other types of PFCs is on the rise," Timmermann said. There is an ongoing need to determine how the entire class of chemicals is affecting children's health.

Hacienda must provide the state with a $50,000 deposit in the event that patient transfers are needed. The facility will also have to make sure it complies with state and federal statutes that pertain to nursing care institutions.\n\nHacienda HealthCare will also be required to undergo unannounced inspections, use a video monitoring system inside the facility and employ people solely to watch out for patient safety. Since the resident gave birth, the center put in place a rule not allowing male caregivers to directly care for female patients without at least another person present.\n\n“Obviously, the focus of this agreement is ensuring the health and safety of patients,” Christ said. “It does not shield Hacienda staff or the board from criminal investigations.”\n\nThe agreement marks the culmination of months of turmoil since the female resident gave birth. Nathan Sutherland, a male nurse who cared for her, was arrested after his DNA matched a sample from the newborn. He has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of sexual assault and vulnerable adult abuse.\n\nJust a few days after the news surfaced, Hacienda’s longtime CEO resigned. One doctor was dismissed and another suspended from providing services at the facility. Multiple senior staff employees and two board members left or gave notice of resignation. Former Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley, who was hired by Hacienda to lead an internal investigation, also quit.\n\nThe departures have not impacted on direct patient care, Petrilli insists.\n\nHacienda officials had planned in February to close down the entire unit where the woman lived, saying it was no longer financially sustainable. The state protested because this would have required relocating nearly 40 other residents who are minors and young adults to other facilities. Hacienda later agreed to relinquish regulation to the state.\n\nIntermediate care facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities have not been subject to state regulation in Arizona since the 1990s, when lawmakers approved the exemption for them.\n\nLawmakers appear poised to reverse course.\n\nLegislation that requires facilities like Hacienda to apply for state licenses and conduct background checks of employees who care for clients was unanimously approved recently in the Arizona Senate, and is awaiting a House vote.\n\n“Hacienda is going to be relieved when they can just be licensed by the department,"” Christ said.

Some of the works sold for as much as 40 times their presale estimates.\n\nDuring the two-day auction of Asian Works of Art,,,,000 went for $43,750. A piece described as a “huanghuali and burlwood table, composed of 18th century elements” was originally estimated to go for $40,000–$60,0, but the winning bid, by a mainland Chinese buyer, was $458,500.\n\n“Furniture and works of art and paintings were the target of frenzied bidding on the telephone, the Internet, and overseas,” according to Bonhams.\n\nThe Bonhams sale follows a trend of increasing sales to Chinese buyers. According to a report released in March by the European Fine Art Fair (TEFAF), China overtook the United States last year as the world’s biggest market for art and antiques.\n\nBut the Chinese market may not be what it seems. One report in March indicates that Sotheby’s lost about $22 million from canceled sales between 2008 and 2011. Sotheby’s eventually had to take the delinquent bidders to court, filing nine lawsuits in Hong Kong, according to court papers cited by Bloomberg.\n\n“It’s an international problem,” Roger Keverne, a dealer who specializes in Chinese ceramics and works of art," told Bloomberg. “Some Chinese dealers are trying to sell things before they pay for them. We don’t know the full extent of it. The concern is that they can also be the under bidders. They push prices up. It isn’t a genuine market.”\n\nThe Epoch Times publishes in 35 countries and in 19 languages. Subscribe to our e-newsletter.

S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Just last year, a senior al Qaeda leader, Husam Abd-al-Ra’uf, was killed in a military raid in Ghazni and was later confirmed by U.S. military officials.\n\nSeparately, the Taliban in recent days said they had seized airports outside the cities of Kunduz and Sheberghan in the north and Farah in the west, making it even more difficult to supply government forces. They said they had also captured the provincial headquarters in Lashkar Gah, the capital of the southern province of Helmand, a hotbed of militant activity.\n\nThe Taliban, however, risk isolating the country if they do seize overall control. “Attempts to monopolize power through violence, fear, and war will only lead to international isolation,” the charge d'affaires at the U. S. Embassy, Ross Wilson, said on Twitter.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile," said Berlin would not provide financial support to Afghanistan if the Taliban take over and introduce sharia religious law.

S. guidelines for preventing and treating HIV-associated opportunistic infections has been released by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in cooperation with the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).\n\nThe new Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents apply state-of-the-art science and medicine to 29 infectious diseases of concern. More than 140 medical experts contributed their knowledge to this edition of the guidelines,,,, these infections continue to threaten the health of many people infected with HIV, says John T. Brooks, M. D., co-author of the guidelines and leader of the HIV Clinical Epidemiology Team in CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention. It is critical that health care providers, especially newer clinicians who may have less experience with opportunistic infections, remain able to recognize the signs and symptoms of these infections and know how to provide the most effective preventive care and treatment.\n\nThe new guidelines combine what were previously two separate publications, one for the prevention of opportunistic infections (last published in 2002) and one for their treatment (first published in 2004).\n\nMajor changes to the guidelines include\n\n* Emphasis on the important role of effective antiretroviral therapy in augmenting immune function, which is pivotal to preventing and managing opportunistic infections\n\n* Information on the diagnosis and management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, a condition in which the immune system begins to recover, but then responds to a previously acquired opportunistic infection with an overwhelming inflammatory response that worsens the symptoms of infection\n\n* Information on the prevention and treatment of hepatitis B and C infections\n\n* Information on interferon-gamma release assays for the detection of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection\n\n* Updated information on interactions between antiretroviral drugs and drugs used to treat opportunistic infections\n\n* A new section on malaria and other tropical diseases that may become opportunistic infections in HIV-infected immigrants to the United States and in HIV-infected American travelers\n\nHIV-associated opportunistic infections in the United States often occur in people who are unaware that they have HIV; in such cases, the opportunistic infection may be the first sign of late-stage HIV disease. HIV-associated opportunistic infections also tend to occur among Americans who are aware of their HIV infection but are not receiving treatment for it, who do not or cannot take antiretroviral therapy, who take antiretroviral therapy but fail to benefit from it, or who do not receive needed preventive care for an opportunistic infection.\n\nA draft of the new guidelines was released in June 2008 for public comment, and an early edition of the new guidelines was published online on March 24. The finalized new Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents are accessible at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5804.pdf and http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5804a1.htm. These guidelines, as well as all federal HIV prevention and treatment guidelines, can be found on the AIDSInfo Web site at http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/Guidelines/Default.aspx?MenuItem=Guidelines.\n\nA final draft of the corresponding pediatric version of these guidelines, Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections among HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children," is under review and will be published later this year.

One man had been killed, a government official said. The unrest erupted moments after Kenya’s election commission announced late on Friday that Kenyatta,55, had secured a second five-year term in office, despite opposition allegations that the tally was a fraud.Interior Minister Fred Matiang'i said the trouble was localized and blamed it on “criminal elements” rather than legitimate political protest.\n\nOdinga’s NASA coalition provided no evidence for its rejection of the result. Kenya’s main monitoring group, ELOG, said on Saturday its tally matched the official outcome, undermining NASA’s allegations of fraud. In addition to the deaths, Kisumu’s main hospital was treating four people for gunshot wounds and six who had been beaten by Kenyan police, its records showed.One man, 28-year-old Moses Oduor, was inside his home in the impoverished district of Obunga when police conducting house-to-house raids dragged him out of his bedroom and beat him with clubs.\n\n“He was not out fighting them. He was rescued by my sister who lives next to him. She came outside screaming at the police, asking why they are beating people,” his brother, Charles Ochieng said, speaking on behalf of a dazed Oduor. More shooting was heard outside the hospital on Saturday morning. In Nairobi, armed police units backed by water cannon moved through the rubble-strewn streets of Kibera, another pro-Odinga slum.Interior minister Matiang'i defended the police against accusations of brutality.“Let us be honest - there are no demonstrations happening,” he told reporters.“Individuals or gangs that are looting shops, that want to endanger lives, that are breaking into people’s businesses – those are not demonstrators. They are criminals. And we expect police to deal with criminals how criminals should be dealt with.”\n\nAs with previous votes in 2007 and 2013, this year’s elections have exposed the underlying ethnic tensions in the nation of 45 million, the economic engine of East Africa and the region’s main trading hub. In particular, Odinga’s Luo tribe, who hail from the west, had hoped an Odinga presidency would have broken the Kikuyu and Kalenjin dominance of central government since independence in 1963. Kenyatta, son of Kenya’s first president, is a Kikuyu.Even before the declaration, Odinga’s NASA coalition had rejected the outcome, saying the election commission’s systems had been hacked, the count was irregular and foreign observers who gave the poll a clean bill of health were biased.NASA provided no evidence for any of its accusations but singled out former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and former South African president Thabo Mbeki—who both led teams of election observers—for criticism.\n\nTop Odinga lieutenant James Orengo said NASA would not challenge the results in court—as Odinga did when he lost in 2013—but hinted at mass action by praising the history of Kenyans in standing up to previous “stolen” elections.“Going to court is not an option. We have been there before,” Orengo told reporters. In addition to the thumbs-up from foreign monitors, Kenya’s ELOG domestic observation group, which had 8,300 agents on the ground, published a parallel vote tally on Saturday that conformed with the official results.ELOG’s projected outcome put Kenyatta on 54 percent with a 1.9 percent error margin - compared to an official tally of 54.3 percent.“We did not find anything deliberately manipulated,"” ELOG chairwoman Regina Opondo said.

After an average follow-up period of 17 years, researchers identified 105 cases major cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThe 10 percent of participants with the biggest spike in blood pressure upon standing were almost twice as likely to experience events like heart attacks and strokes by the end of the study, according to the study, published March 17 in Hypertension. These people had average systolic blood pressure increases of 11.4 mmHg upon standing, and all of them experienced increases greater than 6.5 mmHg.\n\nAmong all the others in the study, systolic blood pressure dipped by an average of 3.8 mmHg when they stood up.\n\nInterestingly, the people with the biggest blood pressure increases upon standing had similar cardiovascular risk profiles to others in the study in many ways — they had similar activity levels, similar weight profiles, and similar family histories when it came to cardiovascular events.\n\nPeople with the biggest standing blood pressure spikes were, however, more likely to smoke. On the other side of the ledger, they tended to have lower total cholesterol levels as well as lower levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that it included only white people and most of the participants were male. Results might be different for women or for people from other racial or ethnic groups.\n\nEven so, the findings suggest that patients may need multiple blood pressure measurements seated and standing to better identify individuals who have an increased risk for heart attacks and strokes, particularly among younger adults.\n\nAfter adjusting for average blood pressure taken over 24 hours, an exaggerated blood pressure response to standing remained an independent predictor of adverse heart events or stroke.\n\n“The results of the study confirmed our initial hypothesis — a pronounced increase in blood pressure from lying to standing could be prognostically important in young people with high blood pressure,"” Dr. Palatini says. “We were rather surprised that even a relatively small increase in standing blood pressure was predictive of major cardiac events in the long run.”	P	2024-02-11 21:10:33	2024-02-11 23:44:45",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
761a10bc84cd40bc01ff2c8c5b3889fd,https://api.theepochtimes.com/science/scientists-declare-2-hawaii-volcanoes-have-stopped-erupting-4923361,eruptions|lava|Mauna Loa|volcano|Kilauea,add,,HONOLULU—U. S. scientists declared Tuesday that two active Hawaii volcanoes—one where lava destroyed hundreds of homes in 2018 and another where lava recently stalled before reaching a crucial Big Island highway—have stopped erupting.\n\n“Kilauea is no longer erupting,,,, the observatory’s scientist in charge.\n\nLava-viewers in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park enjoyed the added rare marvel of being able to see Mauna Loa’s smaller neighbor, Kilauea, erupting at the same time.\n\nKilauea had been erupting since September 2021. A 2018 Kilauea eruption destroyed more than 700 residences.\n\nMauna Loa lava didn’t pose a threat to any communities, but got within 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers) of a major highway that connects the east and west sides of the island.\n\nHon called the two-week spectacle, which is a typical timespan for Mauna Loa, “my favorite eruption.”\n\n“It was a beautiful eruption, and lots of people got to see it, and it didn’t take out any major infrastructure and most importantly, it didn’t affect anybody’s life,” he said at a briefing Tuesday.\n\nHawaii County Civil Defense Director Talmadge Magno said a one-way route that opened to manage traffic from throngs of people watching the lava would close Thursday.\n\nMagno and other county officials had warned that slow-moving lava could force the closure of Saddle Road, also known as Route 200 or Daniel K. Inouye Highway. That prompted motorists to brace for upheaval from a closure that could add hours to commute times on alternate coastal routes.\n\n“Whatever it is — luck, chance — this is probably the best situation that we could ask for from Mauna Loa,” Magno said.\n\nFor Native Hawaiians, volcanic eruptions have deep cultural and spiritual significance. During Mauna Loa’s eruption, many Hawaiians took part in cultural traditions, such as singing, chanting and dancing to honor Pele, the deity of volcanoes and fire, and leaving offerings known as “hookupu.”\n\nLava supply to a Mauna Loa fissure ceased on Saturday, the observatory said, and volcanic tremor and earthquakes associated with the eruption “greatly diminished.”\n\n“Spots of incandescence may remain near the vent, along channels, and at the flow front for days or weeks as the lava flows cool,” the observatory’s activity summary said. “However, eruptive activity is not expected to return based on past eruptive behavior.”\n\nLava supply to Kilauea’s Halemaʻumaʻu lava lake ceased on Friday, the observatory said: “Potential remains for resumption of this eruption or initiation of a new eruption at or near the summit of Kilauea.”\n\nThe observatory will continue monitoring the volcanoes for signs of renewed activity.\n\nDespite the definitive statements, Hon said there’s generally a three-month “cooling off” period before scientists consider the eruption over.\n\nBut there’s been no history of a Mauna Loa rift eruption pausing and restarting, he said, “So we feel pretty confident that this eruption has in fact, paused and is probably over.”\n\nIt was unclear what connection there could be to the volcanoes stopping their eruptions around the same time. The volcanoes can both be seen at the same time from multiple spots in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park near Kilauea’s caldera.\n\n“So, Kilauea may have been diminishing already and the Mauna Loa eruption may have caused enough physical changes to stop it, or it may have just been headed to stop on its own,” Hon said. “So we don’t have a really good answer for that right now.”\n\nScientists will look at data to study the relationship between the two volcanoes," he said.

6e75d11cd84ddb092b5642cfa2f6e32a,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-02-class-potential-drugs-inhibits-inflammation.html#!,compounds|Prostaglandins|EP2|inflammation|EP2 blockers|prostaglandin E2,Ibuprofen|Aspirin|Vioxx|blood|blood-pressure|cancer|cardiovascular|digestion|epilepsy|injury|pain|stroke,inflammation,Scientists at Emory University School of Medicine have identified a new group of compounds that may protect brain cells from inflammation linked to seizures and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nThe compounds block signals from EP2,,,, says senior author Ray Dingledine, PhD, chairman of Emory's Department of Pharmacology. Anywhere that inflammation is playing a role via EP2, this class of compounds could be useful. Outside the brain, EP2 blockers could find uses in other diseases with a prominent inflammatory component such as cancer and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nProstaglandins are the targets for non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen. NSAIDSs inhibit enzymes known as cyclooxygenases, the starting point for generating prostaglandins in the body. Previous research indicates that drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenases can have harmful side effects. For example, sustained use of aspirin can weaken the stomach lining, coming from prostaglandins' role in the stomach. Even drugs designed to inhibit only cyclooxygenases involved in pain and inflammation, such as Vioxx, have displayed cardiovascular side effects.\n\nDingledine's team's strategy was to bypass cyclooxygenase enzymes and go downstream, focusing on one set of molecules that relay signals from prostaglandins. Working with Yuhong Du in the Emory Chemical Biology Discovery Center, postdoctoral fellows Jianxiong Jiang, Thota Ganesh and colleagues sorted through a library of 262,000 compounds to find those that could block signals from the EP2 prostaglandin receptor but not related receptors. One of the compounds could prevent damage to neurons in mice after status epilepticus, a prolonged drug-induced seizure used to model the neurodegeneration linked to epilepsy.\n\nThe team found that a family of related compounds had similar protective effects.\n\nDingledine says that the compounds could become valuable tools for exploring new ways to treat neurological diseases. However, given the many physiological processes prostaglandins regulate, more tests are needed, he says. Prostaglandin E2 is itself a drug used to induce labor in pregnant women, and female mice engineered to lack the EP2 receptor are infertile, so the compounds would need to be tested for effects on reproductive organs," for example.

More than a third of people over 65 fall each year, and half of those suffer recurrent falls. Some falls are fatal; others can result in fracture, injury to internal organs and brain injury, as well as leaving the sufferer with a fear of falling.\n\nFalls among the elderly are estimated to cost £581million per year in the UK and prevention of falls is an important objective in public health.\n\nRobert Judson, a PhD student within the University of Aberdeen’s Musculoskeletal Research Group, was also involved in the research.\n\nHe said: “The ACTN3 gene we investigated has already been shown to be important to elite athletes. A study of top Australian power athletes showed that almost all had fully functioning copies of the gene which seems to give one or two per cent more of the muscle power needed by the fastest sprinters and athletes.\n\n“Separate research has also linked the gene with variation in muscle performance in the general population across all age groups.\n\n“This previous research prompted us to look at the clinical implications of the ACTN3 gene. Since strength and power are major contributors to falling in the elderly," we wanted to see if this gene variant was a risk factor for falling.\n\n“Although we have found that to be the case further work is now required to try to find out how the gene variant exactly works and what age group our finding is most relevant to. There is also a need to establish the other potential genetic risk factors for falling.”	P	2024-02-11 21:10:33	2024-02-11 23:42:12",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The seeds are also called castor beans and contain high levels of ricin,,,, athletes foot, diaper rash, and jock itch.\n\nThe anti-inflammatory and analgesici  XRefers to the drugs used in pain management strategies. Typical examples are ibuprofen and naproxen.  properties of ricinoleic acid helped inhibit inflammation in mice. Similar effects were also observed in guinea pigs (5). Gels containing ricinoleic acid can reduce inflammation and help in pain management (6). However, further human studies are needed to understand the scope of castor oil’s benefits.\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that the moisturizing properties of castor oil can help soothe irritation and pain associated with sunburn. The anti-inflammatory property of castor oil is also believed to be responsible for this property.\n\nDespite offering so many benefits, one might wonder if castor oil is a good remedy for skin rashes. Let’s find out in the next section.\n\nCastor oil is often considered a potential remedy for skin rashes due to its purported anti-inflammatory and moisturizing properties (2). While there’s a wealth of anecdotal evidence and historical use, robust scientific research specifically demonstrating the efficacy of castor oil in treating skin rashes is limited. Individual responses to castor oil may vary, and its effectiveness may depend on the type and cause of the rash.\n\nHowever, those with severe or persistent skin rashes are suggested to consult a healthcare professional or dermatologist who can provide a precise diagnosis and recommend evidence-based treatments.\n\nCastor oil is thick in its natural state, which is why most of us often experience difficulty in applying it smoothly to our skin. Here is how you can apply castor oil to your skin without any hassles.\n\nYou may use it as an ingredient in DIY face masks. You can also apply the liquid directly to your skin:\n\nGently dab it all over your face and neck. Massage the facial oil for 3-5 minutes in circular motions.\n\nYou may mix it with other vegetable oils and plant butters before application. Here are a few more ways to use castor oil for your face.\n\nMix the ingredients and let the mixture rest for 10 minutes. Transfer it to an airtight bottle or container and store it in a cool, dry place.\n\nWhisk the egg yolk until it turns frothy. Add remaining ingredients to it and mix well. Apply the mixture to the face and leave it on to dry.\n\nYou Will Need\n\nMix all ingredients and pour the mixture into the roller bottle.  Shake well and apply as and when required.\n\nIn the following section, we have discussed a nighttime skincare routine with castor oil that you can follow.\n\nA castor oil makeup remover can gently lift the dirt, dust, and makeup from your face. Oil cleansing prevents clogged pores and reduces the chances of breakouts. Gently massage the makeup remover all over your face and neck, and then wipe with a damp cotton pad. Follow up with a mild foaming face wash.\n\nOnce you have finished cleaning your face, apply the castor oil face mask. This helps tone the skin and exfoliate dead skin cells. Spread the face mask evenly on your skin and let it dry. Wash off with lukewarm water. Follow up with a toner and moisturizer.\n\nYour delicate lips need moisturization to stay plump and healthy. Use the castor oil lip balm on your lips before sleeping to keep them soft and supple.\n\nBefore using castor oil, you must be aware of the side effects.\n\nCastor oil may cause skin irritation. In a study, castor oil (undiluted) caused severe irritation on rabbit skin. However, it caused mild irritation on guinea pig and rat skin (7).\n\nHuman trials found that castor oil was not a skin irritant. However, those who have occupational dermatoses (a type of skin inflammation) may experience skin irritation (7).\n\nCastor oil may also cause eye irritation and mild discomfort if it enters the eye (7). Hence, you need to be cautious while using castor oil on your skin.\n\nDo A Patch Test: People can be allergic to castor oil. Hence, a patch test is mandatory before using the oil.\n\nConsult A Doctor: If you have skin issues, allergies, or inflammation, consult a doctor before using castor oil as it may aggravate your condition.\n\nCheck The Label: The preservatives in castor oil can also cause irritation. Read the label and check the list of ingredients. Go for oils from reputed brands or use cold-pressed organic oil without additives. Also, check the expiration date before buying.\n\nNote: If you are pregnant or lactating, consult your doctor before using castor oil.\n\nCan I leave castor oil on my face overnight?\n\nNo. Avoid leaving castor oil on your face overnight. It may clog the skin pores and may also cause allergic reactions.\n\nNo. Castor oil may not darken your skin. However, it may cause breakouts and allergic reactions, which may impact your skin health, leading to a dull appearance.\n\nIt may.

They’re doing nasty things over in the Uyghur territory, they’re still trying to bully Taiwan, they are bullying the people up in Tibet.”\n\nRuan (Frank) Jie, an editor at Tiananmen Times, said that the Chinese consulate was most likely behind the pro-Beijing demonstrators who have been “taught the wrong things.”\n\n“They come here, they don’t know how to pay respect to the freedom of the other people, and they don’t know how to respect the other group of people,” Frank told The Epoch Times.\n\n“These people are very rude. You can see they are very aggressive.”\n\n“In the face of excessive violence, and unlawful oppression from the police, most of the indiscriminate attacks from the gangs, defamation against the protesters from the government, Hong Kongers are still trying their very best to protect our last line of defense, our judicial system,” a spokesperson at the rally said.\n\nThe rally in Melbourne follows other Hong Kong rallies held on the same day in Sydney, Brisbane," and Adelaide.

67ab4b0e3170eb45ebf21751f4001974,https://www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/which-cardio-machine-at-the-gym-is-best/#:~:text=Alloftheseaforementionedcardio,,,,,,,,” says Greg Summerville, MD, a sports medicine physician at the UNC School of Medicine in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. These pros and cons are, however, different for everyone.\n\nDr. Summerville works with patients to create exercise prescriptions for his patients, and takes a range of factors into account, such as age, function, and mobility, as well as existing health conditions or injuries. Those things all make a difference when it comes to which machine is best for you — as do your specific fitness goals.\n\nAll of these aforementioned cardio machines are designed to improve cardiovascular health, meaning it increases your heart and respiratory rate to strengthen your heart muscle and build endurance. But some also build strength, Summerville says. So, think about what you want out of your workout. Are you there for a strict cardio workout or one that combines cardio and strength, for instance?\n\nAnswering questions like that will help you pick the appropriate machine for you. Also, if you have any disability, injuries, or other health issues that could interfere with your ability to safely exercise — or use one of these machines — talk to your doctor or healthcare provider before starting a new exercise routine.\n\nAnd finally, if you’re going to get your cardio in at the gym using one of these machines, pick one that you like using (so long as you can safely do so). Finding a workout you enjoy doing makes it that much easier to come back to and stick with. After all, the movement you do (whatever that looks like) is better than some “perfect” workout you don’t do.\n\nHere’s a rundown of some common cardio machines and their specific pros and cons:\n\nWhat It Is A machine with an endless moving belt for walking or running. “I’d call this the bread-and-butter of cardio machines,” says Araceli De Leon, an ACE-certified personal trainer and health coach.\n\nMuscles Targeted The treadmill primarily helps build your cardiovascular endurance, says De Leon, but walking or running will also work the lower body muscles, including the quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings, and calves, according to ACSM. It’s not the most effective way to build these muscles, but using the treadmill will help to maintain them, Summerville adds.\n\nPerks You can adjust the speed and incline to increase intensity or perform an interval or HIIT workout, says De Leon. Compared with the elliptical and rower, a treadmill has been found to burn more fat, according to a study published in 2021 in the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine. (It’s worth noting that that study only included nine men and no women.)\n\nConsiderations Being on your phone and looking down or looking up at a TV in the gym can strain your neck, says De Leon. Also, walking too close to the console or holding onto the rails can affect your body’s walking cycle. Try to stay in the middle of the belt and avoid holding on, she says. (If you can’t safely use a treadmill without holding on, then another machine may be a better option. See below.) The treadmill can also be a higher impact activity. Though running or walking on a treadmill is not as hard on the joints as running on concrete, says Summerville, exercising on a track or turf outside will be a more joint-friendly form of exercise.\n\nWhat It Is Indoor or stationary exercise bikes come in a variety of styles, such as an air bike (where pedaling pushes air through the wheel, providing resistance), a spin or indoor bike (where you can manually adjust resistance), and a recumbent bike (where you sit in an reclined position), among others.\n\nMuscles Targeted Your quads and hamstrings are the workhorses while cycling. Using a stationary bike can also build lower-body muscle. “By increasing the resistance, you can also get a significant strength-building workout with your cardio,” says Summerville.\n\nPerks On certain styles of bike, you can increase the resistance and stand up to pedal, which simulates climbing a hill, Summerville says. He also recommends indoor bicycling to those who are recovering from lower-extremity injuries. If you have balance problems, a stationary bike is a good option for you, since your feet are in one fixed position (as opposed to a treadmill or stair machine).\n\nConsiderations While it’s low-impact and easy on the joints, if you have anterior knee pain (pain in the front of the knee), Summerville recommends moving to the elliptical, as the pedaling motion on the bike may put too much force on the knee.\n\nWhat It Is An elliptical is a stationary machine with two large pedals that move in a circular motion through space, as well as handlebars that move back and forth. You use the elliptical standing up.\n\nMuscles Targeted Quads, hamstrings, and calves are all worked during this type of exercise, particularly if the resistance is increased. Without using a challenging resistance, this is mostly a cardio workout, says Summerville.\n\nPerks As a low-impact workout, the elliptical is ideal for beginners, as well as people recovering from injury or in physical therapy, says De Carlo. “There is no pounding; your feet never leave the pedals that they’re on,” she says. An elliptical (as well as rower, below) can also be an option for those with physical disabilities, such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine study notes.\n\nConsiderations Avoid hunching, lifting your heels, or leaning too far back, all common mistakes De Leon sees on the elliptical. “Maintain the proper center of gravity on the machine,” she says.\n\nWhat It Is A stair climber, much like the name implies, is a machine that simulates walking up steps. There are many types of stair climbers, such as a step mill (revolving, escalator-like stairs), stair stepper (which has one pedal for each foot that you step on), or vertical climbers (ladder-like steppers).\n\nMuscles Targeted “The stair stepper really activates the glutes, quads, and calves,” says Summerville. A step mill–style climber will be more of a cardio-based workout (you adjust the speed), while a stair stepper allows you to adjust the resistance, which will be more muscle strengthening, he says.\n\nPerks Stair climbing is usually a high-intensity workout. As such, the stair stepper offers one of the highest calorie-burning cardio machines, Summerville notes.\n\nConsiderations Because it’s a higher-intensity exercise, you may not be able to do this type of workout for as long a duration as a less intense workout.\n\nIf you have knee or hip problems, a stair machine may aggravate that pain, and Summerville recommends using an elliptical instead. On a step mill, it can be common to use the handrails to support your weight and take some work off your legs, but this can put too much pressure on shoulders and wrists, De Leon points out. If you’re struggling to keep up with the machine, decrease the speed.\n\nWhat It Is A rowing machine is one where you sit on a sliding seat and use both hands to pull a handle to move you back and forth, mimicking a rowing motion.\n\nMuscles Targeted Muscles of the upper back and shoulders, quads, calves, and glutes get worked during the pushback and pull phase.\n\nPerks The rower can be a one-stop shop. “It’s a total-body conditioning machine. You get cardio, as well as upper and lower body strengthening,” says Summerville. You can also adjust it to get the workout you’re looking for. For instance, by turning down the resistance, the workout becomes mostly cardio; increasing the resistance will provide more muscle activation, he says. Rowing is also a low-impact activity, meaning it’s easy on joints.\n\nConsiderations It may seem intimidating if you’ve never used one, but once you get the hang of the push-pull rowing motion," you’ll feel more confident. Start at the lowest resistance first and increase it as you become more comfortable on the machine (and as your stamina improves).

Here are a few nicknames you can begin with for the name Rider.\n\nWestern astrology includes the construction of a horoscope based on the person’s exact time of birth and location to understand the positions of the planet, stars, and zodiac signs at that time.  However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date. There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.\n\nTo know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth. There are 27 nakshatras, each with its own unique qualities, attributes, and symbolism. Each rashi contains two-and-one-fourth nakshatras in it.

647e0a6864c88509206e0412c221be37,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2009-05-mexico-reopening-flu-lockdown-hitches.html#!,swine flu|Mexico|schools|students|virus,Water|arthritis|asthma|flu|heart|psoriasis|rheumatoid-arthritis,flu|mexico,(AP) -- Mexico's emergence from a national shutdown hit snags as some high schools were not cleaned in time to open and students returned to class in others without swine flu checkups. Cases of the virus popped up in two more Latin America countries.\n\nDespite the hitches,,,, it is possible that a third of the world's population, or about 2 billion people, could become infected if this outbreak turns into a two-year pandemic. Independent experts agreed that the estimate was possible but pointed out that many would not show any symptoms.\n\nIf we do move into a pandemic, then our expectation is that we will see a large number of people infected worldwide, WHO flu chief Keiji Fukuda said Thursday. If you look at past pandemics, it would be a reasonable estimate to say perhaps a third of the world's population would get infected with this virus.\n\nPeople with chronic illnesses are at greatest risk for severe illness from the flu, along with the elderly and young children. So far, most of those with the swine flu in the U. S. and Mexico have been young adults.\n\nWe're still learning about what patients are most at risk, said Dr. Fatima Dawood, a CDC epidemiologist.\n\nWhile Mexican officials insisted the worst was over, authorities in Brazil and Argentina confirmed their first cases of the swine flu, which has now spread to 26 countries, killed 46 people and sickened more than 2,350 worldwide. Previously, Colombia was the only South American country with a confirmed case.\n\nBrazilian Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao said three young adults contracted the virus in Mexico, and a fourth in Florida. Only one remains hospitalized and is reported in good condition. Argentina's first swine flu case was a man who returned from Mexico on April 25 and has already been released from hospital.\n\nOn Friday, Hong Kong prepared to lift its weeklong quarantine on the Metropark Hotel, where a Mexican traveler with swine flu stayed last week. About 280 guests and employees are being held inside the building in a measure some have denounced as overreaction.\n\nRestaurants, movie theaters, bars and businesses across Mexico were allowed to open Thursday, and students returned to high schools and universities for the first time in two weeks. Authorities also said fans will be allowed to attend soccer games this weekend, ending a policy that had teams playing in front of empty stadiums.\n\nMexico's government, which raised the death toll to 44, said it was not letting its guard down and that all returning students would be checked for swine flu. It gave an additional $15 million to Mexico's 32 state governments to buy whatever is needed to disinfect classrooms and provided educators with a guide on ways to protect schools from the virus.\n\nBut at a public high school in the southern city of Oaxaca, an Associated Press reporter did not see any returning students wearing masks, and no doctors or health officials checked people at the door or distributed sanitizing gel.\n\nOrange plastic desk chairs remained covered with grime. Classrooms were packed with as many as 50 students.\n\nThey say they washed the floors with soap and water, but you can't tell, the classrooms smell bad, said Sandra Hurtado, a freshman.\n\nUniversities reopened in the southern state of Chiapas, but various high schools in isolated mountain communities remained closed because officials could not disinfect them in time.\n\nAll will open Monday, said state education spokesman Abel Bravo.\n\nOfficials also wanted to make sure parents, many of whom speak Tzotzil and not Spanish, were informed about swine flu and ways to deter it.\n\nAt a Tijuana high school, nurses distributed sanitizing gel and school officials patrolled halls to stop students from kissing.\n\nI'm annoyed they put gel on our hands like we're kindergartners, she said. I know they are just trying to take care of us, but it's too much.\n\nJaneth Torres, an industrial engineering student, wore a mask to her university in Ciudad Juarez, but she thought the epidemic was overblown.\n\nIn these times of crisis, what we need is to work and to not be wasting time on this foolishness, she said.\n\nThe U. S. has sent more than 400,000 doses of the antiviral drug Tamiflu to Mexico as well as 100,000 protective kits for first responders. U.S. scientists are collaborating with their Mexican counterparts to investigate the outbreak and ways to stem it.\n\nMexico thanked U. S. officials at a ceremony in Mexico City for their cooperation and aid during the outbreak.\n\nThe efficiency and effectiveness with which this emergency has been handled underscores the maturity of relations between the two countries, said Rogelio Granguillhome, who oversees economic ties at the foreign relations department.\n\nIn Asia, top health officials said the region must remain vigilant over the threat of swine flu, stepping up cooperation to produce vaccines and bolstering meager anti-viral stockpiles. The virus has so far largely spared Asia. Only South Korea and Hong Kong have confirmed cases.\n\nContributions from Associated Press writers Istra Pacheco in Mexico City, Ixtli X.

631ffbd25361101aadb36949f7521b83,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-12-covid-related-healthcare-affected-patients-autoimmune.html#!,patients|SARD patients|care|study|diseases|risk,,patients,During the 2020 pandemic,,,, tests and treatments had been canceled more frequently since the pandemic began, and less than 30% felt they had been medically supported for their disease.\n\nThere was considerable variation in participant reports of the quality of contact and care. Explicit reassurance of physician accessibility and/or regular physician check-ins, particularly if unsolicited, contributed to feeling 'cared about' and medically secure, during a very anxious time for many:\n\nGP surgery called me a few times just to check up on me and see how I was doing and feeling…Rheumatologist called…info on shielding and see how I was…I was very happy and felt that they cared. (Patient, 30s)\n\nAlthough many patients expressed understanding and concern for the pressures the NHS and their doctors were under, at the other—more common—end of the spectrum, there was a widespread sense of abandonment, especially among those whose routine care was abruptly stopped and who could not access assistance in an emergency, despite repeated attempts:\n\nThe system abandoned its existing patients to make room for new ones due to COVID-19. There are no longer people out there whom we can speak to and ask help. Which doctor is there to help me?…Left messages…emails…phonecalls…did not hear anything back…it is very easy to fall into depression. (Forum member, 40s)\n\nIn addition to the reduction in routine and emergency care, many participants actively avoided seeking help due to fears of contracting the virus:\n\nI have not reached out for medical attention when I've needed it as I'm so scared I'll be sent to hospital and catch coronavirus. (Patient, 20s)\n\nThese COVID-19 fears were often initiated or reinforced by (sometimes excessively) strongly worded risk guidance from the government and physicians:\n\n[Rheumatologist] said, if you come to the hospital and get it, it's game over for you. (Patient, 40s)\n\nAt the start of the pandemic we were very concerned that SARD and lupus patients would be at much greater risk of COVID-19 complications and increased mortality due to their immune-dysfunction and immunosuppressive medications. However, recent data demonstrates only a marginally increased risk, and our study suggests that the health of these patients has been more at risk from the pandemic-related curtailment in their care than from the virus itself. This study corroborates what we as physicians have observed in practice, that unfortunately some of our SARD patients have suffered damage to both their physical and mental health from the reduced care, says Professor David D'Cruz, lupus specialist at Guy's hospital and study co-author.\n\nThe importance of feeling medically supported was highlighted by its positive correlation (r=0.44) with overall mental wellbeing scores. Those with pre-existing secure medical relationships often expressed lower anxiety and more confidence that support would be forthcoming if required:\n\nI feel they [GP and rheumatologist] care about me. More so my GP who knows and understands my conditions… When I was in lockdown I knew I could call on him…took away a lot of the stress. (Patient, 70s)\n\nThe move to virtual appointments, whilst necessary in the short-term to reduce risk of infection, is a concern for these patients if continued wide-scale at the expense of regular face-face appointments post-pandemic. SARD patients need to build trusting medical relationships where they feel comfortable reporting their many symptoms, with the previous work from this research team finding that many have been conditioned in healthcare avoidance and under-reporting symptoms due to previous misdiagnoses/dismissive responses.\n\nTests and examinations are also often required to enable prompt and correct treatment, and multiple participants reported unnecessary or delayed hospitalisations due to not being able to access or be examined by a physician:\n\nYou just want someone to put a hand on it and tell me I'm not over-reacting or under-reacting…they could have got me to hospital earlier [if I'd been seen face to face] but that's probably my fault as I'm not great at seeking help. (Patient, 20s)\n\nMost study participants were sympathetic to the huge pandemic-induced pressure the NHS and their physicians were facing, yet also often felt 'abandoned' and that their own care suffered greatly. This study emphasizes the importance of all hospitals/GP surgeries having systems in place to ensure accessible lines of communication for all SARD patients, particularly during times of national and personal health crises, says Sloan.\n\nProfessor Caroline Gordon, Emeritus Professor of Rheumatology, University of Birmingham, and co-author of the study, said: This study confirmed that many patients suffered from having their appointments canceled or deferred due to the changes in medical care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when the NHS was managing unprecedented pressures.\n\nIt was important to reduce the number of patients coming to clinics or GP surgeries to minimize the risk of infection but it was most unfortunate that patients in some places had difficulty obtaining emergency phone advice as well, continued Professor Gordon, who is also lead author of the British Society of Rheumatology guidelines for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nShe said, There is no doubt that these serious and complex conditions need expert care and that virtual clinics are often not sufficient to diagnose what is wrong with the patient. They are prone not only to their disease but are at increased risk of infection and other complications of their disease and medications.

I'm sorry, but so far, I've been unable to find anything that matches this description, however, I'll keep looking and post back, when I have information for you. Does anyone else recognize this tablet? What is your general location? I think it might be an over the counter product, of some type, and some of those are regional, so this information could help to narrow down where to look. ## I have a round blue Xanax pill that's scored on one side and has 10 on the other. Doesn’t seem to work at all. Any advice?\n\nWhat does a Xanax 2 XR look like? Round, blue with just a 2 imprint? ## The look of the pill and the imprint will actually vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, since the drug is available not in a generic form. This, it is impossible to say which pill you have unless you provide the imprint, then I can look it up for you. You can actually find blue pills in all different doses of Xanax, as well as a ton with that description that are not Xanax. That is why I removed the prior response to this, the answer was entirely misleading. ## Sorry, that should have said it is available NOW in a generic form, sorry for the typo. ## Also there is a xanax like sedative called nivram or something like that...it is one mg, but has a 2 prionted on it. ## And again, that 2 printed on it may only appl...\n\nIs There A Xanax That Blue And Round\n\nis there a xanax thats blue and and round the front has nothing on it and the back it has a slit ## There is no legal U. S. Xanax tablet that doesn't have a marking on it. Under federal law they are all required to have imprints to enable their identification. Learn more Xanax details here. If there are no markings, then there are 2 possibilities. The first and most likely is that it is an over the counter medication and the second would be that it may be a foreign medication. Where was it found/obtained? ## I found a few round blue pills I was told they are 1 mg xanax but there is no imprint, nothing on either sides not even a line in the middle. It looks just like a round blue 1mg xanax mylan. Please help need to make sure what it is. Maybe its from out of the country. ## I found a...\n\nround light blue pill with G on one side and 2 on the other side ## What they look like can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. However, the pill you asked about does not contain Oxycodone. It contains 2mgs of controlled release Alprazolam, the active ingredient in Xanax XR, it is a Benzodiazpeine used to treat anxiety and nervous disorders.

Scored one side. Is it Xanax\n\nI have some what looks like sky blue, round pills with no imprint and scored on one side. The coating is blue and powder white. Coating is hard compared to prescription US xanax. was told it was 1mg Xanax from overseas. I took 3 and it seemed to be like it but maybe not at strong. I can't say whether it tasted like the normal imprinted one I get through prescriptions. I do know if I took 3 1mg footballs I normally would be knocked on my ass but no. Any ideas anyone? I took the word of someone close to me because she said they were 1mg alprazolam(right word??). I read some forums and its possible it could be this mylan group which makes some with no markings. Or it could be valium. But valium is usually bigger. These have the same size of a normal round 1mg xanax. Anyways, advice muc...\n\nis this pill xanax ## No , though it is in the same drug family and you are actually looking at it upside down. The marking is R 081 and it contains 7.5mgs of Clorazepate, the active ingredient in Tranxene, another Benzodiazepine. It is used to treat anxiety and nervous disorders.

Without the Pill # they might as well be Birth Control medicine? ## Hello, Jim! How are you? I think the marking that you're looking at may actually be 031 R and yes, it contains 1mg of Alprazolam, the active ingredient in Xanax.

They only make me sleepy if i take more than 3 a day . i took one that looked diff than the ones I normally take. It was still blue and round but larger and scored so much so it looked like it would be easier to break in 1/2.. some of them are scored but they crumble if you try yo break them in 1/2. Theyhad markings on both sides but don't remember & I have been sleeping on and off for 24 hours. I may sleep 5-6 hours a night but VERY RARELY ANY MORE . I even drank a Red Bull one time and still went to sleep . i feel i could go to sleep now. ## Well go to sleep than but did you have a specific question? I'm pretty sure with that type of self medicating you are not speaking about...\n\nhow can you check to see if the pills are real or fake(besides looking at them) ##  ## If they are the name brand, from the U. S., then twe's post should be helpful. There are, however, also many generics on the market and many available from foreign countries, as well. The legal, U.S. generics are required by law to have some type of imprint on the tablet, to enable their identification. If the tablets you are questioning are from the U.S. and have an imprint, then if you post back with it, I can easily look it up for you to see if it contains Alprazolam. Just as an example, a round blue pill, with the marking of MYLAN A1 on one side contains 1mg of Alprazolam. A blue oval tablet, with the marking of G 3721 on one side also contains 1mg. The only other alternative, if you've ord...\n\nI found a light round blue pill smooth both sides and looks like one side of markings were rubbed off almost but ALP on the one side is very clear anyone know what this might be also it almost looks like it's a speckled blue color with a hint of white throughout ??? ## Hello, Helen! How are you? Without being certain of the complete imprint, I can't say with certainty, but I think what you found is a foreign Alprazolam tablet, which is a generic for Xanax. It is a benzodiazepine that's used to treat anxiety and nervous disorders. It carries the risk of being habit forming and may cause side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, headache and irritability.

I also cannot find a listing, at least under US prescription drugs, for a tablet with just a GL on it.

A month after delivery both groups of women were equally positive or negative about their birth experience.\n\nA reasonable interpretation of these results is that it is safe to hold off with the oxytocin when the delivery process has been slow for two to three hours, and that this approach could help to bypass the unnecessary use of oxytocin in otherwise normal deliveries, which would also help to avoid unnecessary risks to the unborn child, says Anna Dencker, PhD student at the Sahlgrenska Academy's Institute of Health and Care Sciences.\n\nShe believes that these findings will give midwives and obstetricians a scientific basis for taking a health-promotion approach to deliveries, particularly when healthy women are having their first child. It is therefore important to offer women and their families a good delivery environment, good delivery preparation and personal support with ongoing information on progress throughout the process.\n\nA normal first delivery and positive birth experience are extremely important and impact on future pregnancies and deliveries, says Dencker. However," more research is needed to identify the factors that contribute to negative experiences.

(Note that corticosteroids are a type of steroid drug, and all of the corticosteroids mentioned belong to a class known as glucocorticoids.)\n\nBased on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1998 to 2006, an estimated 1 percent of people in the United States take these types of oral corticosteroids. Individuals take them for a range of conditions that are inflammatory by nature, including severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, chronic allergies, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), vasculitis (an inflammation of the blood vessels), and lupus.\n\nAnother group of people taking oral corticosteroids are those with an adrenal insufficiency disease called Addison’s disease, according to the Mayo Clinic. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism editorial notes that they also face higher risks regarding COVID-19. Addison’s affects only about 1 in 100,000 people. With this disease, the adrenal glands, located above each kidney, are damaged and don't produce enough corticosteroid hormones.\n\nRELATED: What You Need to Know About COVID-19 if You Have Asthma\n\nA corticosteroid works by mimicking cortisol to help the body combat inflammation and stress. The drugs, however, have a dual nature. They can reduce the inflammation that causes things like pain in people with RA and exacerbations in people with severe asthma, but they also lower the immune defenses when taken regularly. This immunosuppression may explain why some people taking oral steroid medications regularly may struggle when they get the virus.\n\n“Chronic steroid therapy can affect the body’s immune system [response] to certain infections, particularly fungus infections and tuberculosis; and it may actually alter the immune system in regard to fighting off certain viruses and bacteria as well,” says Albert Rizzo, MD, chief medical officer with the American Lung Association.\n\nDr. Mirmira and his coauthors note that people should continue taking their medications as prescribed to keep underlying conditions under control, but Dr. Rizzo emphasizes that the dose makes a difference. “The higher the dose of oral steroids and the longer one takes them, the risk is higher,” he says. “This means that each patient should discuss trying to get on the lowest dose of oral steroids needed to control the underlying chronic condition to decrease the risks.”\n\nPatients should not lower or taper their doses on their own but should consult with their doctor, according to Rizzo.\n\nIf people taking these medications start to experience COVID-19 symptoms, they may actually need to increase their daily oral corticosteroid dose.\n\n“Those who are taking steroids for long periods of time we assume do not have normal adrenal function,” says Mirmira. “To compensate for a lack of adrenal function, their dose may have to be increased to respond to the inflammation caused by COVID.”\n\nThe editorial authors recommend if people with known primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency develop symptoms such as a fever and a dry and continuous cough, they should double their oral corticosteroid dose immediately and continue doing so until the fever has subsided. The authors call this a “sick day” rule that many patients should have already been instructed to be following by their doctor. But each patient’s situation is unique, so only make medication dose changes in response to becoming sick after discussion with your specialist physician (such as an endocrinologist or rheumatologist) or primary care doctor.\n\nDo speak to your medical team if you are on long-term oral corticosteroid therapy to determine a plan for adjusting your dose for this type of situation so that you are prepared if you do get sick.\n\n“Every patient who is on long-term replacement corticosteroid therapy follows ‘sick day’ rules that instruct them to double their dose first if they are sick and then call the doctor,” says Mirmira. “Increasing the dose of your steroids when you don’t have normal adrenal gland function could save your life, and waiting to talk to a doctor sometimes can be delayed, and that could make matters worse.”\n\nHe adds that in this case there is no downside to doubling the medication in the short term.\n\nAnd again, the bottom line is that all patients whose doctors have prescribed these daily oral corticosteroid drugs should continue taking them. “Some people might think these medications increase [their] risk of getting infected or increase the severity so [they] should stop taking them,” says Dr. Kaiser, “but they can get very sick from stopping them, so they should not stop.”\n\nCorticosteroids are also prescribed in inhaled forms and topical solutions that are applied to the skin. These medications, while in the same class as oral corticosteroids, pose fewer complications, according to Mirmira, because they are usually in lower doses and they have less systemic effect in the body. “Drugs taken by mouth have a greater effect in your entire body and are usually in a higher concentration than inhaled or topical corticosteroids,” Mirmira says.\n\nMany people with asthma, for example, take inhaled corticosteroids because their condition is not severe enough to warrant taking oral medicines.\n\nThese medications include fluticasone propionate (Advair), mometasone (Asmanex),  ciclesonide (Alvesco), fluticasone (Flovent), budesonide (Pulmicort), budesonide and formoterol (Symbicort), and beclomethasone (Qvar).\n\nMichael Blaiss, MD, the executive medical director of the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, estimates that between about 1 in 4 and 1 in 5 patients with asthma use regular inhaled medication. Dr. Blaiss adds that while these medications may suppress the immune system to a degree, that effect is relatively mild.\n\n“There is really minimal systemic absorption, and we really don’t have any significant data that the typical doses of inhaled corticosteroids have any major effect on the immune system,” he says. “When we inhale the corticosteroids, the effect is in the lungs primarily; it doesn’t go throughout the body having an effect.”\n\nAlthough comprehensive research is yet to be done, Blaiss mentions that there is speculation that inhaled steroids could provide some protection from COVID-19. “The reason is that some of the inhaled corticosteroids may decrease the receptor sites found on the cells in the lungs where the virus binds,” he says.\n\nIf steroid medications might increase the risk of COVID-19, why then can they help some patients who are very sick with COVID-19?\n\nWhile it may sound contradictory, Blaiss says that the drugs do have the potential to be either harmful or helpful when it comes to COVID-19. “Depending on the situation, they can suppress the immune system and make you more vulnerable to the virus or be a treatment,” he says.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a combination therapy of corticosteroids and an antiviral agent may reduce symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (a life-threatening respiratory illness) related to COVID-19. And the NIH strongly recommends the corticosteroid dexamethasone as part of a treatment plan in hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen, with the greatest effect observed in patients who require mechanical ventilation.\n\nThe NIH based its advice on a study published in July 2020 in The New England Journal of Medicine that found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients on oxygen support (either mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone) who received 6 milligrams of dexamethasone daily for up to 10 days had reduced mortality within 28 days compared with similar patients not taking the steroid.\n\nBlaiss explains that many people with severe COVID-19 experience a cytokine storm, an overreaction of the immune system, which releases an overabundance of cytokines (chemicals that, in excess, can cause hyperinflammation and damage the lungs and other organs), according to a report published in October 2020 in the journal Clinica Chimica Acta; International Journal of Clinical Chemistry.\n\n“Dexamethasone stays in the system longer than most steroids and blunts the immune system,” he says.\n\nRemember: Steroid drugs function by dialing down the immune response and reducing inflammation. It’s not necessarily ideal to have the immune response dialed down if you’re counting on it to protect you from the virus that causes COVID-19 or other infections. But if you’re already sick and COVID-19 has ramped up your immune response in an unhealthy way, a steroid drug that can help lessen that response could potentially be helpful," Blaiss explains.

Learn more about homeopathic medicine and its relation to increasing height. Continue reading.\n\nAlthough being short in height is not a disease or a shortcoming, having an average height does contribute to a striking personality. Moreover, a person can fulfill many activities with less effort if they have a good height. Lack of such abilities can make short individuals feel alienated and depressed, and it has been observed that many also lack confidence due to being short.\n\nThe cartilagesi  XStrong and flexible connective tissue found between the joints. Recent research suggests that it is vital for bone growth.  in our body play a very important part in growth and height (1). Several experts state that it is necessary to feed the growth hormones with the right kind of food so that they provide ample support to the cartilages (now considered a vital element for the growth of the human body) and reduce hormonal imbalances for height increase. Homeopathic medicines have the ability to promote better strength and durability in the cartilages so that the proper structure of the human body is maintained.\n\nThe spinal cord is located in the upper part of the human body. This structure also plays an important part in height growth. When a person is young, it is easier for him/her to gain a few inches. This is possible even when the bone plate fuses with the lower body! The breadth of the disci  XCartilaginous discs appear between vertebrae in the spine. They constitute one-quarter of the length of the vertebral column.  determines the length of the spinal cord; this actually affects the height and growth of a person. That is why it is commonly stated that if the disc is thicker, the person will be taller.\n\nNow, let’s know how effective homeopathic medicines are for height increase.\n\nHomeopathic medicines for height increase readily harmonize with the body’s immune system due to which they start creating an immediate effect, unlike other regular medicines that suppress the body’s immune system. Here are some of the related facts:\n\n* To get the best results, it is important that the right remedy be taken in appropriate proportion.\n\n* Some of the most common medicines that are used for increasing height include Silicea, Baryta Carb, and Symphytum.\n\n* The extent of growth in height will differ from person to person, as it depends upon the person’s physical condition, metabolism and symptoms, and potency of a medicine. But you may notice a considerable amount of increase in your height if you continue to take them regularly for some time.\n\n* Almost all these natural remedies improve body growth, but Baryta carb 30 is known to be highly effective in increasing height among all age groups. This medicine has been known to give a minimum 70 percent result.\n\n* This medicine can also be given to adults above 20.\n\n* You must remember that homeopathic drugs are not addictive at all. When a person feels relieved,and the body symptoms improve, the medication can slowly be discontinued. If you do not feel any better than you were before, the selection of remedies was absolutely wrong.\n\n* Homeopathic medications are all-natural and considered completely safe around the world. Homeopathy is a safe treatment procedure. It can be administered to little babies and even pregnant mothers.\n\n* Homeopathy is a holistic treatment procedure. In simple terms, it can be stated that homeopathy deals with the root cause of the problem.\n\n* Homeopathic medicines must always be taken on an empty stomach to get immediate results.\n\nA blogger tried homeopathic medicines like Baryta Carb 200 for a height increase and shared his experience on his blog. He writes, “One homeopathy doctor advised me this when I was 23. I was 5’6″ at that time. I regularly took this medicine for one year, and now my height is 5 ’11.” He further provides a few notes to keep in mind for optimal results, stating, “Stop eating Onions . maintain a gap of atleast half an hour before and after taking the medicine . Most importantly , if you want the best results take one dose of Baryta Carb 200 in the early morning with empty stomach even before a brush. Try this and You will see the result in less than a month . But please maintain regularity in taking the medicine (i).”\n\nHomeopathic medicines are natural and may not cause any side effects (2). Moreover, they can be taken for a long term without any fear of addiction. Most of the medicines are derived from natural components; hence, these medicines have a holistic approach towards treatment. Therefore, you can continue taking these even if you are being prescribed some other medicines in allopathy, ayurveda, or unani.\n\nHomeopathic medicine for height is considered an effective alternative to anabolic steroids. These herbal remedies may help in increasing height to a certain extent. However, it is very important to take the prescribed remedy in the right amounts to obtain these results. Also, the extent of height increase varies among individuals, their health conditions, and the medicine’s potency. Nevertheless, regularly consuming these medicines may have a positive impact on height. In addition, homeopathic medicines are non-addictive and can be discontinued after obtaining the desired results.\n\nIt varies from individual to individual. According to anecdotal evidence, while SBL Rite Hite did help increase height in some individuals, it didn’t show any visible improvement in others.\n\nPossibly. Although most growth spurts end after puberty, some individuals may grow a couple of centimeters depending on their genetics, nutrition, and exercise regime.\n\nWho should not use homeopathy?\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that people with serious medical conditions like cancer, heart issues, allergies, and pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid using homeopathy. Consult your doctor before opting for this treatment.\n\nEuropean countries like Britain, France," and Spain have banned the use of homeopathic treatments.\n\nHow long does it take for homeopathic medicine to increase height?\n\nHomeopathic treatments are highly customized to address each person’s symptoms and needs.

4f1f032047e857cc293d798788a823f0,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-02-bird-flu-menace-asia.html#!,vaccines|virus|strain|poultry outbreaks|Vietnam,flu,flu,(AP) -- Thought bird flu was gone? Recent human deaths in Asia and Egypt are a reminder that the H5N1 virus is still alive and dangerous,,,, the Middle East and Europe. The number of poultry outbreaks has greatly diminished since then, but the virus remains entrenched in several countries and continues to surface sporadically, resulting in 20 to 30 human deaths globally in recent years.\n\nBird flu remains hard for people to catch, with most people sickened after being in close contact with infected poultry, but experts have long feared it could spark a pandemic if it mutates into a form that spreads easily among people.\n\nThe fresh wave of cases comes amid a controversy involving scientists who created new lab-only versions of the virus that spread more easily among animals, hoping to better understand it. After a loud uproar over whether publishing the research would put the recipe for a bioweapon into the hands of terrorists, the researchers have agreed to temporarily halt their work.\n\nThey are set to wrap up a two-day meeting on the issue Friday with international experts at the World Health Organization in Geneva.\n\nVietnam has long struggled to control the virus, but it has made progress - going 21 months before reporting its two most recent deaths in the past month. It has also experienced a burst of poultry outbreaks in 11 provinces nationwide over the same period. Officials have issued fresh warnings for farmers to beef up surveillance, especially since they can no longer rely on the latest poultry vaccine in the north and central aress where it is weak or useless against a new strain that has emerged in the region.\n\nWe have to increase biosecurity, said Thanh, the animal diagnostics director.\n\nThe new strain had earlier been identified in China and was also recently found in Bangladesh and Nepal, where it likely spread via wild birds, said Jan Slingenbergh, a senior animal health officer at the U. N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome.\n\nViruses are constantly mutating and require new vaccines to protect against infection - the same reason new human seasonal flu shots are developed each year. A new vaccine is in the works, and scientists have stressed that the new strain has not changed in any way that suggests the virus is becoming more dangerous.\n\nThe U. N. agriculture agency warned of a possible resurgence in bird flu outbreaks after the new strain was identified, potentially increasing risk to humans. However, Vietnam's two recent deaths occurred in the southern Mekong Delta, where the vaccine remains effective. WHO stressed it is also normal to see a spike in cases and poultry outbreaks during this time of year.\n\nWHO has always said that as long as the virus is entrenched in poultry, which it is, there continues to be the risk of bird-to-human transmission, spokesman Gregory Hartl said in Geneva. That risk means that you cannot predict exactly if the transmission will happen and if it will be regular, but there is the risk so that's why it's not surprising to see cases.\n\nVietnam buys most of its poultry vaccine from China, which has continued with its robust vaccination campaign of some 15 billion doses despite the emergence of the new strain. Researchers there have developed a new version that works against the strain, but it's unclear when it might be ready for distribution, said Keith Hamilton, an animal influenza expert at the Paris-based World Organization of Animal Health.\n\nWe emphasize that vaccination is a complementary tool, he said. It has to be used in conjunction with other control measures - biosecurity on farms, early detection is essential, so is a rapid response to contain and eliminate sources of disease.\n\nBut in Ha Nam province, on the outskirts of Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, animal health officials are desperate to contain a poultry outbreak that hit last week. They have ordered 1 million doses of vaccine, hoping it will provide at least some protection.\n\nI wish to have an effective vaccine against bird flu as soon as possible, so I can go on raising ducks, said farmer Nguyen Van Duong, whose entire flock was slaughtered after the virus was detected.\n\nI am devastated at losing my investment on the ducks, but we will do anything to work with the authorities to stop it from spreading. The last thing we want is an outbreak to happen again.\n\n©2012 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast," rewritten or redistributed.

In his July 19 open letter, Xu thanked them but said he would not accept the money. He said he was still able to make a living by writing, and that the money should go to people who experience great hardships.\n\nIn February, Xu called out the CCP for causing the global pandemic, in an article titled, “The Angry People Fear No More.” In the article, he criticized the Chinese regime for having wrought disasters due to its “incompetence,” “moral corruption,” and “institutional failures.” He called on the 1.4 billion Chinese people to “get ready to embrace with your strength, your heart, and your life—the spirit of freedom that shall shine upon the land.”\n\nIn May, Xu published another article titled, “China, the Lone Boat in the Ocean of World Civilization,” providing a laundry list of the Chinese regime’s deceptive tactics. He concluded by saying, “Enough with the mountain of corpses and the seas of blood from 70 years of red dictatorship!”\n\nLi Hengqing, also a Tsinghua University alumni and former student dissident during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, told The Epoch Times that the communist regime uses the prostitution allegation to criminalize anyone it pleases. “The regime shows no bottom line when it comes to [making up] excuses.

In fact, according to reports issued by the National Institutes of Health, if used consistently and in conjunction with action plans and avoidance of environmental triggers, the therapies should ideally make it possible for children to experience no symptoms of asthma, no limitation in function and no serious exacerbations.\n\nThat's a lofty goal to dangle before patients, Halterman said. We wanted a closer look into why so many children weren't reaping the benefits of today's therapeutic advances.\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend that all children with persistent asthma – half of the 9.4 percent of children who have any form of asthma – are prescribed daily anti-inflammatory medication. In spite of this, the most recent study revealed that 37 percent received no preventive medication, and perhaps more shockingly, 43 percent did receive medications, yet they were still troubled by poor symptom control (experiencing either persistent symptoms or frequent asthma attacks).\n\nThis second group – the children who were experiencing poor symptom control despite the use of preventive medications – has received relatively little attention until now, Halterman said.\n\nEspecially interested in this disconnect, Halterman and her colleagues began to examine the data and found several potential reasons for it, including children not using the daily medication consistently, being exposed to environmental triggers, such as secondhand smoke, or allergens like mold or pets, or simply not receiving adequate education about what to watch out for or what to do in the case of an attack.\n\nEven more surprisingly, this incidence of poor control despite medication use was prevalent across the board, regardless of the child's age or the household's income level.\n\nThe bottom line is that there's much work that needs to be done in making sure that children with asthma receive appropriate and effective care; it's more complex than one might think, Halterman said. Asthma care involves coordination on everyone's part. Parents and patients need to report and track symptoms, relay this information to their doctor, use medications as prescribed, and steer clear of triggers. Physicians need to recognize persistent symptoms in their patients, and take time to prescribe," educate and draw up unique action plan for each patient's management.

Popular fiction writers,,,, and amuse enthusiastic audiences.\n\nWant advice on trendy topics for that bestseller you’ve been contemplating? Need to know how to get it published after it’s finished? The wordsmiths at the Festival of Literature will tell you in a dozen easy steps. As a special bonus, you can explore the wonderful world of ski slopes, sand dunes, and Arabian souks just outside the window.\n\nThe home of the festival, Dubai, is an amazing place, an Emerald City that soars in jagged high-rise spires out of a desert that just a generation ago housed a few coral block buildings and some roaming camels. Fishing dhows with lateen rigs still sail up and down Dubai Creek as they have for millennia, but instead of Indian traders and Persian merchants clustering their wharves, skyscrapers, hallmarked by the world’s tallest building, form walls of glass and steel behind them.\n\nAt the edge of this surreal scene, a celebration of books seems somehow right. Dubai’s Festival of Literature is the brainchild of British-born Isobel Abdulhoul, who came here as a bride in 1968.\n\nDuring the festival, I met with Abdulhoul at a lunch prepared by chef and cookbook author Greg Malouf. Over grilled quail, homemade laban cheese, and fresh sesame bread, she told me that when she came to Dubai the only books she had were those she'd brought with her.\n\n“I read them over and over and over and when I couldn’t find anymore, I opened Dubai’s first book store,” she said. It was Abdulhoul’s love of books that led her to launch the festival.\n\nThis year over 8,000 visitors arrived in Dubai City to hear 170 authors discuss their work, autograph their latest creations, and talk about the world of literature. InterContinental Festival City, the hotel complex where the festival was held, was jammed with a milling sea of literature enthusiasts who roamed the centre and spilled out around outdoor food stands, shawarma stalls, and performance areas where stand-up comedians traded off with drum-thumping rock bands.\n\nIn the halls and corridors there were tables of books everywhere you looked. It was my first year at the festival and the family-friendly event offered some of my favourite children’s authors and historical fiction writers signing their works and chatting about creativity. Would I see best-selling British author Rachel Hore? Would I be able to talk with her? The answer to both questions turned out to be yes.\n\nTo celebrate the festival’s opening, an evening event called Desert Stanzas was planned out in the distant dunes. I travelled for an hour by minibus and then took a 4-wheel drive over shadowed sands to what at first appeared to be a brilliantly lit mirage, an oasis of tents and camels and oriental carpets rising spectacularly from a shallow bowl in the desert.\n\nWe were greeted by rows of dancing men in long white traditional robes and lavishly dressed children who poured rosewater over our hands out of silver ewers. An Arabian buffet of exotic food, hot off of glowing coals, was set between the long lines of open tents where tables and cushions had been arranged.\n\nAs we ate, we listened to poets from different cultures read their works; Andrew Motion, Britain’s former poet laureate, headlined the event. Celebrated Arab poet Khalid Albudoor gave a dramatic reading to the accompanying music of an Arabian oud, referring to his poetry as “melodies of travelling Bedouins.”\n\nThat night, I learned that poetry is the language of the nomad recited in the evening around the campfire. “It doesn’t matter if you understand it,” German poet Frank Klötgen later told us, “try to feel it.” In that setting, it wasn’t difficult.\n\nFor the Arabs of the Gulf, the beginning is the word and the word is everywhere you look. As in the Far East, calligraphy is a highly rated art, so the next day I made a pilgrimage to one of Dubai’s greatest calligraphers, Iranian-born Amir Hossein.\n\nHis shop, The Golden Pen, is a tiny place in the Moroccan quarter of a western-style mall. Western classical music wafted me into an Aladdin’s cave crammed with treasures. Hossein is a restless artist always trying to push boundaries. He showed me a sewing needle, the smallest that he could find in the souk (open-air marketplace), and on the all but invisible head he had engraved the word “Allah.” The work was so tiny he had had to invent an entire toolkit to create it.\n\nIn his shop vault he kept the opalescent nacre of a mollusk shell on which he had engraved the first 55 pages of the Koran. Its matching engraved bivalve had been a gift to the son of Dubai’s ruler. “The two pieces represent friendship,” said Hossein, holding the fragile shell to the light. It was so translucent that I could see his hand through it. As another gesture of friendship, he drew my name in Arabic calligraphy in handmade walnut ink with a sharpened stick of bamboo and made me a present of it.\n\nFor something completely different the next day, I went to a panel of bestselling murder mystery writers. South African Deon Meyer shared the stage with British authors Simon Kernick and Peter James, and Swedish best-selling author Camilla Läckberg. How did they think up their stories? Did they always know who the killer would be?\n\nSounds like Peter James gets much of his material riding around with the police of Brighton. “No one,” he told us, “knows more of life than a 30-year career cop.” James plots his works in detail (you could almost see the flow charts) while Läckberg likes to let things evolve.\n\n“You need an idea, a character, and an ending,” advised the woman whose first work of fiction written at the age of four was the murder of Mrs. Santa Claus.\n\nOne thing the festival is particularly good at is arranging evening events (open to the public) to complement the day’s panels. Following the murder mystery panel, I went off to the Murder Mystery Dinner with a dimly-lit ballroom full of other mystery aficionados. The theme of the festival was Metamorphosis, and the Dubai Drama Group had prepared to perform a play entitled “A Modern Metamorphosis.”\n\nOver tuna tartare and beef tenderloin, we watched the actors create characters whose dialogue revealed hidden lives and secret yearnings. Who would die and who would be called out as the wily assassin? Each dinner table was asked to form a team, question the suspects, and then write down the identity of the suspected perpetrator. We called our table team “Medea,” a suitably sinister name for a group of hot shot amateur detectives who in the end managed to guess the identity of the villain.\n\nOn the last day of the festival, travel writer and panelist Tim Mackintosh-Smith quoted the words of a much earlier traveller, Ibn Battuta: “Time does not flow with the same speed in every place.”\n\nOutside, along Dubai Creek, an estuary flowing inward rather than outward to the sea, dhow builders were slowly fashioning the carapaces of boats whose antique design was buried in the past, while a mile away frantic crews of builders threw up skyscraper after skyscraper in a race to the future.\n\nAt The Golden Pen, Amir Hossein painstakingly drew a flourish of complex calligraphy with ancient roots, while all around me authors cranked out books so quickly their publishers could scarcely keep up. As a fitting finale to my literary adventures, I took a taxi to look at the Persian Gulf. Scholars and poets had written about it. Merchants and travellers had sailed across it. I'd read about it, studied it in school, and there it was, blue and sparkling, beyond a wide swath of sand.\n\nThe end of the beginning or the beginning of the end? In Dubai only time would tell.\n\nSusan James is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles. She has lived in India, the U. K., and Hawaii, and writes about travel, art," and culture.

But the rise of communism in China had a devastating effect on the Middle Kingdom’s ancient culture and traditions.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) plan to “revolutionize” Chinese culture was in fact an attempt to destroy its spirit completely.\n\nThe traditional Chinese culture sought harmony between man and the universe and emphasized ethics and morality. It was based on the faiths of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism and embodied honesty, kindness, harmony, and tolerance.\n\nThese principles and the social standards set by Confucius’s five cardinal virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faithfulness were anathema to the CCP’s policy of atheism.\n\nThe CCP had an inherent ideological opposition to traditional Chinese culture—which believes in gods and a heavenly mandate—and made the culture an enemy in an effort to bolster its own control.\n\nSoon after the CCP came into power in 1949, it began to destroy churches and temples, burn scriptures, and force Buddhist monks and nuns to return to secular life. By the 1960s, there were hardly any religious places left in China.\n\nMao Zedong’s Great Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966, brought even greater religious and cultural catastrophe with its campaign of “Casting Away the Four Olds”: old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits.\n\nBuddhist and Taoist temples, historical and scenic sites, calligraphy, paintings, and antiques became the main targets for destruction by the Red Guards. Many one-of-a-kind books, calligraphy works, and paintings that had been collected by intellectuals were burned or shredded into pulp.\n\nWriter Qin Mu (1919–1992) described the Cultural Revolution in bleak terms: “It was truly an unprecedented calamity. [The CCP] imprisoned millions due to their association with a [targeted] family member, ended the lives of millions more, shattered families, turned children into hoodlums and villains, burned books, tore down ancient buildings, and destroyed ancient intellectuals’ gravesites, committing all kinds of crimes in the name of revolution.”\n\nIn this way, the dignity and sacredness of religion and culture was annihilated, as was people’s spiritual identity formed by faith and culture. Many lost their moral bearings and became indoctrinated with the CCP’s own set of standards, such as class struggle, inciting hatred and violence, self-criticism, and “fighting with heaven and earth.”\n\nThis “Party culture,” which has at its heart despotism and dictatorship, was established through continuous political movements and was promoted by the CCP as a continuation of traditional Chinese culture.\n\nAfter the Party adopted economic reform and an open-door policy, it renovated many churches as well as Buddhist and Taoist temples. Throughout China, temple fairs, art and calligraphy exhibits, culture festivals with dragon and lion dances, and New Year galas were staged.\n\nThis, however," simply restored the superficial appearance of the culture. The essence of China’s profound culture had by then been well and truly gutted.

:) i remember watching the next superbowl, Giants vs Bills, and become a Redskins (Commanders fan) in 1991 :) i remember i was 10 years old, and it was superbowl 26, i stayed up to watch the Redskins vs Bills, it was awesome! :) i remember my mom and dad taking me to the Sports Shack shop in the Norwichtown mall, and bought a Redskins, superbowl 26 champions hat for me :) each year, the superbowl, and this very special day, has always been such an incredible event :) superbowl party's, and all of the great joy of enjoying the game :)\n\ni remember when i was a kid, growing up and my friends and i would play football in the yard, and road :) we'd buy our football's, at the Ames and Caldoor's stores, and would play football for hours and hours!

Instead,,,, later coming back with news that there was $150,000 in the wallet.\n\nAt that point, the woman said that all three of them had to come up with some cash to show that they would be able to handle to be financially responsible. They drove to a local credit union. “I walked to the bank and withdrew the money,” said the victim.\n\nThey all went back to First Weber Realty, seemingly to get the withdrawn money counted, but when it was the victim’s turn to go in, the two scammers fled with her money, and First Weber said they didn’t know the women.\n\nShe spent three hours with them, thinking she would come out richer than before. Local police said they never heard of the scam. But such a scam is minor compared to those troubling the southern parts of the country.\n\nBigger and more devious scams are plaguing disaster-stricken Texas. Those seeking to help the situation are advised to investigate the charities they are giving to, so that hundreds of thousands of dollars don’t go towards fake charities, which happened after Hurricane Sandy.\n\nAccording to NPR, people seeking to donate should be cautious about charities that are created specifically for one hurricane or other disaster. Reputable, well-known organizations are more trustworthy. The gofundme.com crowdfunding site is also taking steps to inform people of how they can identify reputable organizations that they would like to donate to through the online platform.\n\nThey also recommend not giving cash directly, and to be wary of clicking on emails that ask for donations, as they could be from computer hackers," and might install malware if you click on suspicious links or download anything.

Because hospital patients are often elderly or have underlying health conditions, they also are at higher risk for injuries if they fall.\n\nTechnology that quickly detects falls and alerts health professionals can improve patient care and help in the diagnosis of injuries, said Rantz. Also, technology that captures data on patient falls can help health professionals learn about risk factors for falls, which could help create more effective ways of preventing them.\n\nDuring the past several years, the team has explored a variety of technologies in its work with senior citizens, including Doppler radar, sound sensors and video cameras, said Marjorie Skubic, PhD, the LaPierre Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and a professor of computer science at the MU College of Engineering. Doppler radar and sound sensors can both detect that a person fell, but neither shows what happened leading up to the fall, Skubic said.\n\nBy seeing what happened before a fall, we can better understand what caused it, Rantz said. The more we know about what causes falls, the more effectively we can prevent them.\n\nOrdinary video cameras record the events before a fall, but they work only when there's enough light, said Skubic, who also serves as the director of MU's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology.\n\nWhen video-game motion-capture technology was released a few years ago, the MU team gained a new tool, one that avoided the limitations of the other technologies and could monitor falls in a different way. And unlike video cameras, the motion-capture system portrays people as anonymous, three-dimensional silhouettes, protecting their privacy. Those are a few of the reasons that Skubic called the motion-capture technology a game changer.\n\nThe device looks like a thin black box. On one side, black glass covers the sensors that pick up the movements of video-game players—or of patients in a hospital room. One sensor, a depth camera, measures the distances to objects in its view. A cord connects the black box to a small computer.\n\nThe system works by sending a grid pattern of infrared light, invisible to the human eye, into a room, and then examining how objects and persons in the room distort the pattern. The machine analyzes these distortions to make a 3-D map, showing a patient, her bed and tray table, and everything else in the room.\n\nIf the system detects a person on the floor, it automatically reviews the preceding events as the person moved to the floor. Does the movement represent a fall, or a person kneeling to tie a shoe lace? Applying a precise algorithm created by Skubic, doctoral graduate Erik Stone and an interdisciplinary team, the computer calculates the probability that the changes represent a person's fall.\n\nIn the study, the MU research team installed a motion-capture device in each of six patient rooms at University Hospital in Columbia, Mo. The hospital is part of the MU Health System, an academic medical center that includes the MU School of Medicine, the MU Sinclair School of Nursing and the MU School of Health Professions. The researchers trained nursing staff to explain the study to patients. The devices collected data continuously, monitoring the rooms 24 hours a day.\n\nThe research article covers the first eight months of the study. During that time, the sensors did not record any patient falls, but stunt actors simulated 50 falls in the rooms, providing more data for the algorithm.\n\nWe believe the technology is promising because it accurately identified falls and may eventually help prevent falls, said Rantz, who also serves as a Helen E. Nahm Chair with the MU Sinclair School of Nursing and the University of Missouri Curators' Professor. We are now in the process of installing the sensors in more patient rooms to learn more about its effectiveness.\n\nThe researchers felt that one potentially encouraging aspect of their work was the reduction of falls in the six patient rooms during the study.\n\nI think these devices may have brought more attention to the issue of falls," Skubic said. It could have made patients more aware of the risks and more likely to ask their nurses for help getting out of bed.

You tend to use several variations of your child’s name; some are meaningful, while others are simply adorable sounds. Here are a few nicknames you can begin with for the name Anala.\n\nWestern astrology includes the construction of a horoscope based on the person’s exact time of birth and location to understand the positions of the planet, stars, and zodiac signs at that time.  However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date. There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.\n\nTo know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below. This will give you a glimpse into the world of astrology tailored for your baby.\n\nVedic astrology, also called Jyotisha, provides deep insights into a person’s life based on celestial positions at birth. Rashi and nakshatra, which are an integral part of Jyotisha, are believed to influence an individual’s personality and life events. The following sections give you rashi-related information, such as the associated letters, elements, ruling body, quality, and nakshatra for the name Anala. These details help analyze a person’s characteristics, personality, and behavior. As shown in the following table, each rashi is associated with specific sounds, which are often used as the starting letters of names for newborns in Hindu families. Each rashi is represented by a figure and one of the five elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether (Space). One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth. There are 27 nakshatras, each with its own unique qualities, attributes, and symbolism. Each rashi contains two-and-one-fourth nakshatras in it. For example, Aries contains Ashwini, Bharani, and Krithika nakshatras.\tThe below table provides information on the nakshatras’ degrees on the zodiac circle, their lords and related syllables, for babies born in the Mesha (Aries) rashi.

253e8d55808b3eea07a90972bb6665ea,https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/72677#B76,wines|compounds|Phenolic compounds|oak wood|grapes,,,Phenolic compounds are a wide family of thousands of natural bioactives well-known for their overwhelming demonstrated health benefits. Particularly in wines,,,, or environmental factors, among others. Winemaking process (alcoholic and malolactic fermentation) and wine aging with or without wood contact produce endless reactions giving rise to complex transformations (copigmentation, cycloaddition, polymerization, and oxidation) of polyphenols. This chapter gathers the most relevant information about the composition, variations, and transformations of phenolic compounds from grape to wine including their influence on sensory properties.\n\nGrape and wine phenols represent a large family of compounds with a great diversity of chemical structures and degrees of complexity. The term “polyphenols” or “phenolics” is used to define a group of plant secondary metabolites that presents one or more than one hydroxyl (▬OH) groups attached to one or more benzene rings [1].Polyphenols are synthetized by phenylpropanoid pathway, being the amino acid phenylalanine (a shikimate pathway product) their common precursor. They can be divided into flavonoid (anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, flavanones, flavanonols, flavones, and chalcones) and non-flavonoid (hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids and stilbenes) families [2].These compounds are critically important for wine quality, due to their contribution to their sensory properties: color, taste, mouthfeel, flavor, astringency, and bitterness [3, 4]. For this reason, the understanding of the relationship between wine quality and its phenolic composition is considered, nowadays, one of the major challenges in enology research. Furthermore, fermentation, maturation, and/or aging of wine may be performed in contact with oak wood. Spontaneous clarification, slow and continuous oxygen diffusion through the oak wood pores (for barrels and casks), and extraction of many volatile and nonvolatile (mainly ellagitannins) compounds are observed. As a result, wine undergoes a modulation of its quality and complexity with regard to aroma, structure, astringency, bitterness, persistence, and color stability [5].The objective of this book chapter is to examine the key phenolic compounds in grapes and in oak wood used for the maturation of wine. Likewise, the evolution of these compounds during winemaking and wine aging and their impact in the sensory properties of wine will be discussed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the grape ripening phase, the physiological and biochemical changes determine grape quality. The first period of grapes growth consists mostly of cell division and expansion, followed by a rapid growth phase during which the berry is formed and the seed embryos are produced. In this period, several compounds are accumulated in the berries, especially the tartaric and malic acids, conferring the acidity of the future wine. During the first growth period, several polyphenolic compounds increased like hydroxycinnamic acids in grapes’ pulp and skin and tannins and catechins in the skin and seed. The most important changes in grapes composition happen during the second growth phase (the ripening stage). Grapes switch from small, hard, and acidic berries to larger, softer, sweeter, less acidic, flavored, and colored ones. The majority of the solutes accumulated during the first growing phase remain at harvest. During the second period, the malic acid is metabolized and used as an energy source, its proportion decreasing toward the tartaric acid concentration, which remains almost unchanged. In general, the chemical composition of the final product is much more complex than in the raw material, due to the formation of new compounds [71].Winemaking techniques involve the extraction of juice from ripe grapes, fermentation with yeast, and changes in polyphenolic composition that occur due to the participation of these compounds in various reactions such as copigmentation, cycloaddition, polymerization, and oxidation. These reactions begin after grape crushing, followed by fermentation and aging, contributing to the sensory properties of wines, mainly color and mouthfeel sensation. The total extractable phenolic content in grapes is encountered in seeds (60–70%), in the skin (28–35%), and in the pulp (about 10% or less). In the seeds, the phenolic content may range between 5 and 8%, by weight [72].The understanding of the relationship between the quality of a particular wine and its phenolic composition remains one of the major challenges in enological research. For example, the anthocyanin fingerprints of varietal wines are proposed as an analytical tool for authenticity certification [27]. Patterns of some classes of flavonoids are under strict genetic control, and their distribution varies considerably among different grape cultivars [73, 74].Several factors impact the wine phenolic composition, including the “terroir,” the grape variety and its degree of maturation before harvesting, or the winemaking process with its specific conditions of fermentation or aging [75]. Certain technological procedures, such as addition of sulfur dioxide (SO) and/or ascorbic acid prior to crushing the grapes, maceration, yeast strain utilization and alcoholic fermentation, oxidation, or adsorption, can also influence the levels of phenolics during the winemaking process [76]. The addition of SO and pectolytic enzymes before fermentation caused an increase in color intensity, color stability, total phenolics, anthocyanins, catechin, and epicatechin in a red Italian wine [77].In white grape musts, the predominant phenolic compounds are hydroxycinnamic tartaric acid esters as catechins and proanthocyanidins which are found mainly in their skins. The must fermentation of red wines is realized in the presence of both grape skins and seeds. During this process, phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins are subjected to various reactions, such as enzymatic oxidation, nucleophilic substitution, degradation, and cycloaddition of the carbonyl compounds leading to the formation of vitisins (A and B). These pyranoanthocyanins in red wine are mainly orange pigments. Moreover, the red wine color evolution and stabilization are mainly induced by the formation of polymerized pigments. The acidic hydrolysis of proanthocyanidins leads to the formation of flavan-3-ol unit or tannin oligomers with a carbocation in C4 position which can be attacks by positions C6 and C8 of another proanthocyanidins or an anthocyanin. This reaction will induce the modification of the condensed tannin polymerization degree or the formation of the polymerized pigment. These newly formed purple pigments induce the color modification of the young red wine. Moreover, polymerization through acetaldehyde between two condensed tannins or between condensed tannins and anthocyanins also occurs during the winemaking process and aging. The formation of these ethyl bridge compounds will also produce modification in the organoleptic properties of the wine and the color stabilization since the ethyl-bridged anthocyanin-tannin compounds also exhibit purple color [72]. During the red wine maturation in bottles, all these newly formed purple polymerized pigments will undergo slight oxidative reaction to slowly form some more orange pigments which together with pyranoanthocyanins are forming the color of old wine. The winemaking process involves the alcoholic fermentation of must, often followed by malolactic fermentation (MLF). When MLF is completed, the wine is subjected to different clarification and stabilization treatments and/or is stored in oak barrels for aging for a variable period of time. MLF and aging in oak barrels are two enological processes which modify the composition and sensory characteristics of the wines [5,78,79, 80]. When oak wood derivatives like chips are added after fermentation, wines seem to have a greater aging potential compared to the wines fermented with chips due to their higher ellagitannin content and enhanced condensation reactions. On the other hand, color stabilization and tannin polymerization occur faster when chips are added during fermentation, resulting in shorter aging periods suitable for early consumed wines [81]. MLF in tanks may simplify the control of the process; however, the use of oak wood during the MLF stage affects the chemical and sensory attributes of wines. In red wines, MLF container plays an important role on proanthocyanidin and anthocyanin concentration and evolution as oxygen in small quantities favors polymerization reactions among anthocyanins and tannins. Wines performing MLF in tanks present a higher total proanthocyanidin concentration (5.8 g/L wine) than that of those which accomplished MLF in medium-toasted barrels (4.9 g/L wine). The major wine glucosidic anthocyanin, malvidin, showed as well greater levels in wines carrying out their MLF (33 and 26 mg/L wine, respectively, for tank and barrel MLF). Regarding ellagitannin concentration, their content is strongly influenced by both barrel toasting and MLF container. For instance, in the case of medium-toasting barrels, castalagin was found at concentrations twofold times higher (19 mg/L wine) when MLF was performed in barrels [79]. Concerning sensory results, the MLF strengthens the organoleptic preference of wine when it takes place in barrels [79,80, 82]. In white wines, total ellagitannin concentration varied from 7.8 to 17.4 mg castalagin equivalents/L for wines performing MLF in tanks and barrels, respectively [83].The phenolic composition of wine changes along the wine aging process reflects in the color and astringency level of the final product. From 1978 to 2005 vintage for Cabernet Sauvignon wine, phenolic compounds, total tannins, and total anthocyanins varied from 1735 to 2903 mg/L, from 1.3 to 2.2 g/L, and from 15 to 123 mg/L, respectively [29]. In general, the relative anthocyanin content decreases upon aging although this chemical modification is associated with a very clear change in color. This characteristic is often used as a quality standard for aged wines. One of the main factors responsible for anthocyanin loss is the storage temperature [84]. The majority of red wines aged are in contact with oak wood, whether in form of barrels or in form of oak wood derivatives. As a consequence, their phenolic composition changes due to the addition of oak wood extracted compounds. These compounds include hydrolyzable tannins (-glucosidic ellagitannins), aromatic carboxylic acids, and several aldehydes. Regarding wine-air interactions, barrel structure allows a controlled entrance of oxygen, which is essential to the polymerization and the slight oxidative reactions between different types of flavonoids, leading to a modification of the organoleptic properties of the wine. Indeed, wood can affect wine composition and, consequently, organoleptic properties through different mechanisms. On the one hand, wine compounds can be adsorbed onto wood surface. On the other hand, compounds, such as ellagitannins, can be extracted from wood to the wine due to the hydro-alcoholic nature of the latter. Ellagitannins can take part in oxidation reactions that may favor the polymerization reactions between flavanols and between flavanols and anthocyanins. Furthermore, they can directly react with these types of compounds giving rise to flavano-ellagitannins or anthocyano-ellagitannins [85]. The formation of flavano-ellagitannins and the -1--ethylvescalagin in red wines aged in oak barrels has been reported. The ellagitannin concentrations fluctuated between 4 and 8 mg/L, being castalagin the ellagitannin with the highest concentration, followed by mongolicain A [86]. As a consequence, ellagitannins can modulate wine astringency and color through interactions with these compounds. Strong correlations have been observed between ellagitannin concentration and both antioxidant capacity and astringency sensation [5,63, 78]. The amount of ellagitannins released into the wine depends on the content in the oak wood barrel, which in turn is dependent on several factors (Section 3). For instance, after 12-month aging with woods, the total ellagitannin level revealed a large diversity of concentrations ranging from 6.3 to 26.1 mg of ellagic acid/L wine. The wine with heavy toast woods and the wine with low toast woods presented, respectively, the less and the highest ellagitannin concentrations [78]. Storage with oak can also cause a decrease in anthocyanins, catechin, and epicatechin but an increase in total phenolic content and a stabilizing effect on color [77].Besides the winemaking process, and oak wood aging, wine can be further exposed to oxygen during aging in the bottle, depending on the oxygen permeability of the closure. Because of the extremely low rates of oxygen ingress through a closure, this form of oxygen exposure has been referred to as nano-oxygenation. Oxygen transmission rates (OTR) of wine closures may vary widely depending on closure type and strongly influence the evolution of white and red phenolic composition and astringency during bottle aging [87].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no doubt that wine is an extremely complex medium and that polyphenolic compounds play an essential role on its final sensory properties. There is an inestimable chemical diversity of polyphenols in both grapes and wines. Each family can be present in free or conjugated forms, with different hydroxylation levels and substitutions or even forming adducts between them. Starting with the raw material, phenolic compounds in grapes can vary substantially depending on several factors as ripening, viticulture practices, environmental conditions, and varietal or genetic differences. Such is the case that each cultivar may be considered as “exclusive” and consequently, the resulting wine too. Anthocyanins (mainly present in skins) and flavan-3-ols and condensed tannins (mainly present in skins and seeds) are the most abundant polyphenols in grapes. On the one hand, anthocyanins are responsible of the color of red wines, and their profile can be used as an analytical tool for authenticity certification. On the other hand, flavan-3-ols and condensed tannins are key compounds due to their implication on color stabilization and astringent and bitter properties. Finally, other phenolics as flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acids are mainly known for acting as copigments. Oak wood is commonly used during fermentation and/or aging of wines. The phenolic composition of oak wood will vary depending on species, geographical origin, and grain or wood processing. In quantitative terms, ellagitannins are the major phenolic constituents of oak wood, and their level and profile may affect the astringency and bitterness of wine. Winemaking produces important changes in polyphenolic composition. In fact, phenolics participate in several reactions such as copigmentation, cycloaddition, polymerization, and oxidation. Thus, new compounds as vitisins, ethyl-bridged anthocyanin-flavanol derivatives, or pyroanthocyanins are formed. Furthermore, wine aging in contact with oak wood affects the degree of complexity of phenolic compounds. In this sense, ellagitannins are actively engaged in oxidation reactions that favor the polymerization between flavanols and between flavanols and anthocyanins. Overwhelming evidence has demonstrated that tannins (mostly condensed tannins), thanks to their ability to precipitate salivary proteins, are implicated on wine astringency. Astringency intensity, even if it is a multifaceted sensation complicated by a number of variables, is more influenced by the source of proanthocyanidin (seed or skin) and by well-defined proanthocyanidin fractions (oligomeric or polymeric). Up to now, ellagitannins’ direct impact on astringency and bitterness sensation remains still unknown. One of the major limitations of the half-tongue test used to evaluate their sensory impact is the absence of contact between the ellagitannins and the entire oral cavity. Further studies are needed under wine conditions. Additionally, recent studies highlight that other phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins/pyranoanthocyanins or flavanols may also interact with salivary proteins and bitterness receptors. Thus," a new research line in the field of sensory properties linked to wine phenolic compounds sensory properties is opened.

Though it appears as a yellow spot,,,, trimming, and drying of nails create conditions favorable for fungal growth.  Weakened Immunity: A compromised immune system due to medical conditions or medications may elevate the risk of infection.  Public Spaces: Walking barefoot in public spaces like swimming pools exposes individuals to fungal spores.\n\nKnow how hydrogen peroxide can aid in effective management of nail fungus in the next section.\n\nHydrogen peroxide is a household remedy that is used to disinfect minor scratches and cuts. When used for treating nail fungus, its antifungal properties kill the fungus, letting the damaged part of your nails grow out. The liquid has several uses as an antiseptic, disinfectant, oxidizer, bleaching agent, as well as an antifungal agent (1). Its strong antifungal and antiseptic properties effectively treat nail fungus (2).\n\nWith regular use, the treatment can heal your nails within weeks or months, depending on the severity of the infection. It is recommended to keep using the treatment for a couple of months after your nail has been restored back to health to prevent future fungal infections. While there are not a lot of scientific studies on this treatment, it is a tried and tested home remedy that is sure to give you optimal results.\n\nDr. Anna Chacon, a board-certified dermatologist, says, “Regular use of hydrogen peroxide can show improvement in toenail fungus within a few weeks to months, depending on the spread of the infection.”\n\nThirty-eight participants in the trial either used Mycosinate or an approved toenail lacquer. A base layer of Mycosinate is a method for prolonged hydrogen peroxide emission. According to the research, Mycosinate is a novel topical treatment for onychomycosis that offers a high rate of efficacy and a superior safety profile.\n\nHere, I’ve put together a comprehensive step-by-step guide on how to use hydrogen peroxide to treat nail fungus.\n\nMix equal parts of the hydrogen peroxide and distilled water in the plastic tub. Ensure that you are not using anything stronger than a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution; or it may damage your skin. Soak the nails that have been affected by the fungus in this solution.  Dry your nails with a dry tissue. Dispose off the tissue after use. Ensure that your nails are completely dry before you cover them.\n\nAndrea Jean, a Youtube blogger, used hydrogen peroxide on her feet in a video. She used a foot file to remove the remaining dead cells for soft and healthy feet. She said, “It Is an all-natural remedy if you have athlete’s foot. You’re just going to want to shave off, rub off any of that extra dead skin. The hydrogen peroxide helped loosen it and killed any bacteria (i).”\n\nYou have to repeat this process every day until, and even after, the problem subsides. Getting rid of nail fungus is not easy and will take a lot of patience and effort.\n\nThis oxidate therapy using hydrogen peroxide is highly effective when it comes to treating nail fungus. The method involves using the peroxide to soak the infected and affected nails. As the oxygen levels increase, the fungus on your nails gets destroyed.\n\nWhile method 1 is often quoted as a solution to nail fungus on the internet, we recommend using method 2. This is because under certain conditions, mixing hydrogen peroxide and vinegar can form peracetic acid, which is a caustic chemical that does not share the desired properties to treat nail fungus.\n\nMix equal parts of the hydrogen peroxide, distilled water, and vinegar in the plastic tub. Ensure that you are not using anything stronger than a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution; or it may damage your skin. Soak the nails that have been affected by the fungus in this solution.  Dry your nails with a dry tissue. Dispose of the tissue after use. Ensure that your nails are completely dry before you cover them.\n\nMix equal parts of the hydrogen peroxide and distilled water in the plastic tub. Follow the steps mentioned in method one. On day 2, follow the same steps using equal amounts of vinegar and distilled water. Keep alternating between hydrogen peroxide and vinegar until the problem subsides.\n\nYou have to repeat this process every day until, and even after, the problem subsides. Getting rid of nail fungus is not easy and will take a lot of patience and effort.\n\nVinegar is an acidic solution that helps relieve itching and restores the pH balance of your skin and nails. These properties help the liquid create an unfavorable environment for the fungi to breed in, killing off the infection. Apple cider vinegar helps reduce inflammation, reducing the pain caused by nail fungus.\n\nMix the baking soda, peroxide, vinegar, Epsom salt, and water in a plastic tub until they are well combined. Ensure that you are not using anything stronger than a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution; or it may damage your skin. Soak the nails that have been affected by the fungus in this solution.  Dry your nails with a dry tissue. Dispose of the tissue after use. Ensure that your nails are completely dry before you cover them.\n\nYou have to repeat this process every day until, and even after, the problem subsides. Getting rid of nail fungus is not easy and will take a lot of patience and effort.\n\nBaking soda contains antifungal properties that help prevent the growth of fungus. This solution helps balance your skin’s pH levels while killing off fungus.\n\nDr. Anna Chacon recommends saturating your toe in the peroxide for 30 minutes. She also adds, “If you do not see results, please visit your local dermatologist and get prescription treatment for your toenail fungus.”\n\n* Wash and disinfect all of your shoes and socks.\n\n* Disinfect your nail clippers with hot water and alcohol.\n\n* Keep your fingers and toes covered when you are outside.\n\n* Keep your nails short and clean.\n\n* Thoroughly dry your nails after washing your hands and feet.\n\n* Spray your gloves and shoes with anti-fungal sprays on a regular basis to kill lingering fungi.\n\n* Always dry your shoes and socks properly. Moisture is your worst enemy as it creates a breeding ground for fungus.\n\nIf you experience any of the following side effects, try using a solution weaker than 2%. You can also try diluting the solution further with water.\n\n* Hydrogen peroxide can irritate your skin causing redness, stinging, and mild itching.\n\n* It may also dry out your skin and cause cracked feet.\n\n* Peroxide can cause your skin to peel.\n\nYellowing of nail spots or discoloration of nails may possibly be due to a fungal injection. If not treated early on, it can spread and crack the whole nail causing pain and discomfort. While OTC antifungal creams can help, you can try hydrogen peroxide for nail fungus to give you that initial relief. It acts as an antiseptic and antifungal treatment and helps contain the infection. Soaking your feet in a dilution of hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes every day can result in a visible difference in a few weeks’ time. You may also use vinegar or baking soda as detailed above to enhance its antifungal benefits further. However, if this does not help in alleviating the pain and symptoms, you are advised to consult a podiatrist.\n\nHow long does hydrogen peroxide take to cure nail fungus?\n\nDepending on the severity of the condition, it may take anywhere between a few weeks to several months of regular treatment with hydrogen peroxide to cure nail fungus.\n\nHow long does it take baking soda to kill toenail fungus?\n\nIt may take baking soda a few weeks to improve the condition of the toenail. However, using baking soda to treat toenail fungus is not scientifically proven.\n\nWhat is the fastest way to cure toenail fungus?\n\nOral antifungal drugs are the fastest way to cure toenail fungus.\n\nHow do I know if my toenail fungus is dying?\n\nDiminishing discolored areas on the nail, reduction in the thickness of the nail, new healthy nail growth from the base of the nail, and a clear demarcation line between the old infected nail and the new growth are some signs that the toenail fungus is dying and your nail is healing.\n\nWhat happens to untreated toenail fungus?\n\nUntreated toenail fungus may cause serious damage to your nail, widespread infection," and foot pain.\n\nYou can deal with your nail fungus problem using hydrogen peroxide.

As the supplier had technically met the contract’s specification and had already incurred costs, 30% of the contract value was unable to be recovered.”\n\nDuring the year, the DHSC wrote off laboratory equipment valued at £663,000 following the closure of two regional testing sites and “there being no alternative options for repurposing or storing these assets”.\n\nAdditionally, a stockpile of intensive care unit items was created to prevent shortages.\n\nThe reports said: “A small number of items, valued at £313,0, reached their expiry date and had to be written off.”\n\nWhen it comes to NHS Test and Trace, DHSC has “impaired… consumables totalling £195 million in respect of items for which we have not currently identified a suitable use.”\n\nTwo flights relating to the transportation of PPE from China had to be cancelled due to lack of stock availability at the time, and the £649,000 deposit for the two flights was taken as a cancellation charge, “as per the terms of the contract”.\n\nThe report also pointed to “changing requirements” which meant the DHSC incurred a cancellation fee of £339,000 following the cancellation of two contracts for quarantine hotels.\n\nInterest payments were paid to a supplier totalling £1.6 million resulting from the late payment of invoices as a result of an initial contractual dispute, which ended up in the DHSC being forced to pay.\n\nThe Government’s auditor, the comptroller and auditor general to the House of Commons, said in his section regarding the accounts that the DHSC was put under “extraordinary pressure” by the pandemic and had to operate outside normal processes and procedures.\n\nBut he said it “was not able to manage adequately some of the elevated risks, resulting in significant losses for the taxpayer. Nearly two years later," it has not fully restored effective control over some of the inventory purchased”.\n\n“The chief secretary to the Treasury wrote to the department on 21 December 2021 confirming HM Treasury’s view that £1.3 billion of the department’s spending did not have proper HM Treasury consent and was irregular. He stated that ‘in the vast majority of cases’ this was because either the department or NHS England had spent funds without approval or in express breach of the conditions that had been set.”	P	2024-02-11 21:10:33	2024-02-11 23:14:51",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We know the rotational period of this star to 15 decimal places, making it truly one of the most accurate clocks in the universe.But, as we show in a paper published today in the journal Science, it was not supposed to be this way. Gravitational waves from all of the black holes in the universe were supposed to ruin the timing precision of this pulsar. But they have not.\n\nGravitational waves stretch and squeeze space, causing the distance between us and the neutron star to change. The gravitational waves we were looking for should have altered that distance by about ten metres, a tiny fraction given that this neutron star is about 3.6 x 1019 metres from Earth (that’s 3.6 with 19 zeros following)! But this should have been enough to show up in our measurements. Yet the fact that our measurements are so accurate tells us that something is wrong with the theory. This doesn’t mean that gravitational waves don’t exist. There are other facets of our understanding of the universe that might be off track.Whatever the resolution to this quandary, it is sure to change the way we understand the most massive black holes in the universe.The centre of our galaxy harbours a black hole that weighs more than four million times the mass of our sun. But this is a lightweight; other galaxies contain black holes weighing more than 17 billion times the mass of our Sun.\n\nAnd we have good reason to believe that most, if not all, galaxies contain supermassive black holes in their cores. We also know that galaxies throughout the universe grow by merging with one another. Following the merger of any two galaxies, the two black holes from the parent galaxies sink to the centre of the daughter galaxy, forming a supermassive black hole binary pair. At some point, the subsequent evolution of the binary pair becomes dominated by the emission of gravitational waves.\n\nGravitational waves are tiny ripples in the fabric of spacetime, and are a direct consequence of Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity. We celebrate its 100th birthday in November this year. When any two black holes are spiralling around one another, they ought to emit gravitational waves. These carry energy away from the system, causing the two black holes to move closer together.The sum of all the binary supermassive black holes in the universe should produce a background of gravitational waves (similar to the cosmic microwave background). It is this background that was expected to ruin our precision timing of PSR J1909-3744.Astrophysicists have made a number of predictions about the strength of the background. These predictions incorporate state-of-the-art measurements of galaxy formation and evolution, and the most sophisticated theoretical models of how the universe evolves following the Big Bang.But we want to be very clear that our lack of a detection does not imply that Einstein’s theory of relativity is wrong, nor does it imply that gravitational waves don’t exist. While we don’t know the real solution, we have a number of ideas.Perhaps not every galaxy in the universe contains a supermassive black hole. Reducing the fraction of galaxies that host supermassive black holes in the models reduces the predicted amplitude of the gravitational wave background, potentially making it undetectable by our observations.\n\nPerhaps we do not understand the relationship between the mass of the host galaxy and the mass of the black hole. We use empirical relationships between galaxy and black hole masses to determine the latter. While we believe these are robust in the local universe, the black hole mergers we are most sensitive to occur billions of light years from us, where our understanding of these empirical relations is far from complete. Perhaps one of our assumptions about the process that drives the mergers is too simplistic. For example, if the centres of galaxies contain significant amounts of gas, it can act like an extra friction force, causing black holes to merge with one another quicker than expected. This would also cause a smaller-than-expected amplitude of the gravitational wave background.At the moment, each of these scenarios is equally plausible. Continued observations of pulsars, as well as observations of the distant universe with large optical telescopes, may soon allow us to distinguish between these ideas. And, one day, we may finally find the direct evidence for the existence of gravitational waves that we’re looking for.Paul Lasky, Postdoctoral Fellow in Gravitational Wave Astrophysics, Monash University and Ryan Shannon, Research Fellow, International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, Curtin University," CSIROThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

To monitor cardiovascular responses, the individuals completed an isometric handgrip test, which involves continually and forcefully squeezing an object for a few minutes, at the beginning and end of a structured, 16-week walking program.\n\nWhat this research highlights, at least using the handgrip test, is that the advantages we think exercise is going to give individuals may not be the same across genders, particularly for those who have Type 2 diabetes, Kanaley said. This is a concern because there are high mortality rates with Type 2 diabetes, especially for women. We're trying to find successful interventions to help these individuals, and we keep assuming that exercise will do the trick—we think when we tell people to go train, regardless of gender, everyone will get the same results. Our research indicates certain exercises may not be enough for women, as our walking program did not show positive improvements for them.\n\nObese women with Type 2 diabetes might benefit from longer durations or higher intensities of exercise, Kanaley said. In addition, Kanaley said more concern should be placed on how long it takes cardiovascular function to return to normal after exercise as well as how fast the heart beats during physical exertion.\n\nA lot of people focus on how high individuals' heart rates get during exercise, but their recovery rates also should be monitored, Kanaley said. When you exercise, you want your blood pressure to rise, but you don't want it to get too high. Your blood pressure should return to normal relatively quickly after you stop exercise. In our study, the recovery rate for women was not as rapid as for men. After the men trained, they got an even better recovery time," whereas women's time stayed about the same.

Only half of the estimated 61 million Americans at high risk of losing their eyesight had an eye exam in the past 12 months - partly due to a lack of insurance coverage for preventive eye care and glasses, noted a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report last fall, but also because many eye diseases don't show symptoms in the early stages, so people don't realize they have a problem.\n\nDoctors, too, may need to step up their game. A new study in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology found that in one of four cases, trained eye professionals missed the early, more treatable signs of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - an irreversible loss of vision that affects 14 million Americans.\n\nBut there is some good news for those already diagnosed with eye disease, including new treatments and cutting edge research that could bring hope to millions in the near future. There are also simple changes everyone can do to greatly reduce their risk of eye disease. Here's what you need to know:\n\n- Glaucoma is caused by a buildup of damaging pressure within the eye and requires a daily dose of medicated eye drops to hold the disease at bay. Unfortunately, getting patients to follow that regimen daily for years is difficult, says Dr. Andrew Iwach, board chairman for the Glaucoma Research Foundation. Instead, clinical trials have started testing a thin polymer ring to be worn in the eye that would slowly release medication throughout the day. It's like drip irrigation, rather than flooding the eye, Iwach says.\n\n- Using stem cells to regenerate healthy cells in disease-damaged eyes is the holy grail for researchers. This is especially true for incurable conditions that damage the retina, the layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye.\n\nEarlier this year, a Japanese man became the first person to receive retinal stem cells created from donated skin cells to stop his macular degeneration from getting worse.\n\nAnd scientists at the Jules Stein Eye Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles report promising results from transplanting stem cells from embryonic cells into patients who had been blind for decades from AMD and another disease. A study in 2014 reported that 10 of the 18 patients who received the cells experienced significantly improved vision.\n\n- The Argus II, a bionic retina approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is now being used by more than 100 people with retinitis pigmentosa and other related conditions. It also recently was implanted in the first person with macular degeneration.\n\nThis bionic eye uses a tiny camera attached to glasses that sends visual data to a microchip implanted in the eye, which then sends light signals to the brain. So far, the vision it provides is rudimentary, but patients say even some vision can greatly improve the quality of life for a blind person.\n\nWAYS TO HELP YOUR EYES\n\nTo keep your eyes healthy, says the National Eye Institute, get a dilated eye exam to detect problems early; know your family history and whether you're at risk for eye disease; wear sunglasses to block out ultraviolet rays that can increase the risk of cataracts; and control your diabetes to prevent damage to the retina.\n\nHere are five other surprising things that can help:\n\n- Adjust your yoga and sleep position: Those with glaucoma should avoid head-down positions in yoga (downward facing dog, for example), which can cause a dangerous rise in internal eye pressure, a study last year found. Other studies show that habitually sleeping on one side can cause greater pressure and worsening vision loss in the eye facing downward.\n\n- Got dry, irritated eyes? Add more fish to your diet. The omega-3 oils in fish not only can cut the risk of dry eyes, studies show, but omega-3 fish oil supplements may improve dry eye symptoms. A new study published in the journal Cornea found that taking a daily omega-3 supplement improved dry eye symptoms after six weeks.\n\n- Think of it as Vitamin See. A diet high in vitamin C - oranges, red peppers, strawberries, broccoli - may help curb cataracts by 33 percent. British researchers believe vitamin C helps prevent the clouding of the lens that causes cataracts, but their findings only pertain to vitamin C from food, not supplements.\n\n- Send your children outside. Adults aren't the only ones with dry eye woes. A new study finds the same problem among children ages 7 to 12 who spend more than three hours daily looking at a smartphone. Playing outside could help. Researchers at the University of Cambridge report that for every hour children play outside in natural light with far-away horizons, they reduce their risk of near-sightedness by 2 percent.\n\n- Exercise (and spinach) helps glaucoma. A brisk walk for 20 minutes four times a week can lower the pressure inside the eye, which helps protect the retina, according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation. Adding more dark, leafy greens - spinach," kale - to your diet could help too. A recent study found that those who ate the most greens were 21 percent less likely to develop glaucoma.

Editors have highlighted                                                     the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA leading testing expert says DNA genotype testing is revealing how most of us have a little Neanderthal in our blood,,,, Modern humans like ourselves only reached the British Isles around 40,000 years ago and, because of the impact of the last ice age, Britain was only continually settled around 12,000 years ago. Much of our DNA dates back much further than this, meaning our origins can be traced back to places far beyond Britain.\n\nThe journey that each of our ancestors took may be very different from that of our friends' and neighbors' ancestors, however, and these different migratory paths, from thousands of years ago, are still captured and represented in our blood.\n\nFascinatingly, the majority of Brits have a small amount of genetic material from humans who actually arrived here far earlier than modern man. Genetic testing reveals that people of European or Asian backgrounds have around 2% Neanderthal DNA, with some individuals having even more. People of African descent, in contrast, are likely to have far less, around 0.3%.\n\nNeanderthals evolved in Europe and Asia while modern humans—our species, Homo sapiens—were evolving in Africa. Modern humans migrating into Europe are now thought to have met and interbred with Neanderthals. Those of us with a percentage of Neanderthal in our DNA share some genes with Britain's earliest colonizers.\n\nEarly humans may have arrived in Britain as long as 950,000 years ago. We know Neanderthals had arrived here 400,000 years ago thanks to the discovery of the skull of a young woman in Swanscombe, Kent. The National History Museum says these early humans probably traveled across the vast prairies of ancient Britain following herds of large animals, such as mammoths, to seasonal hunting grounds.\n\nIt used to be thought that Neanderthals and modern humans shared no genetic makeup and that modern humans may have even killed off the Neanderthals. However, more recent research has shown that modern humans overlapped with Neanderthal populations for a period.\n\nA paper published in Nature in 2014 traced the complete genome sequence of a Neanderthal woman from the Altai Mountains in Siberia. It found evidence of inbreeding, possibly as small groups became isolated due to factors such as climate change. This could have hurried their extinction.\n\nIt's not only the distant origins of mankind that can be mapped using modern genotesting. DNA testing tells us about the migration patterns of both our paternal and maternal lines, based on our genetics. Genotyping charts a migration map, tracing the maternal and paternal lineage through DNA haplogroups (groups that share a common ancestor).\n\nSome of the information contained within our Ancestry Information Markers can also link us with modern populations today. For example, London Medical Laboratory's new DNA Genotype Profile test compares our genetic profile with reference datasets of 150+ populations, based around 37 clusters in different continents and regions. The test reveals the proportion of various modern populations recorded within our own individual genetic makeup. For example, the test may indicate that our ancestry is approximately 50% African, 25% European, 20% Asian, and 5% unknown.\n\nTaking a test can reveal some fascinating insights into our ancestry, sometimes revealing surprises along the way. In the future, it could also have a more practical medical application. It's possible that variations in our DNA may influence the risk of developing certain diseases. As we study more about our ancestors and their genetic makeup, we may be able to build up patterns of disease risk.\n\nTo find out what secrets your DNA holds about your ancestral lineage is surprisingly easy. London Medical Laboratory's simple saliva test can be taken at home or through the post," or at one of the many drop-in clinics that offer it across London and nationwide in over 95 selected pharmacies and health stores.

Banaag and other officials reported a lower death toll, more than 5,500, saying authorities were still verifying other drug-related deaths.\n\nLast year, a Philippine court found three police officers guilty of killing a student they alleged was a drug dealer in the first known such conviction under the crackdown.\n\nThe court ruled the officers murdered Kian Loyd delos Santos during a raid in Caloocan city’s slums in the Manila metropolis and rejected the policemen’s claim that the 17-year-old fired back while resisting arrest. Delos Santos’s family and witnesses testified in official investigations that he was shot in a dark alley near a creek as he pleaded for his life.\n\nDelos Santos’s killing and that of a South Korean was allegedly strangled to death by an anti-drugs officer in an extortion attempt prompted Duterte to briefly suspend the drug crackdown amid outcries.\n\nNational police chief Oscar Albayalde said criminal complaints will be filed separately against at least two officers after a 3-year-old girl, Myca Ulpina, was killed in a police raid in late June in which her father, a drug suspect, was gunned down along with another civilian and a police officer in Rodriguez town east of Manila.\n\n“There are certain flaws probably in what happened during operations but these are actually being addressed,” Undersecretary Severo Catura, an official dealing with human rights issues, said in the news conference. “That’s why we are saying here that however we’re concerned with regard to apprehending criminals, we’re also that concerned with regard to ensuring that the rule of law is followed.”\n\nHe added that more than 200 policemen have been killed and 700 others wounded in drug raids—statistics that Duterte himself has often cited to counter allegations by human rights activists that police have killed suspects beyond the law because they violently resisted.\n\nBanaag said it was the first time authorities disclosed the full extent of police who have been disciplined for lapses in the anti-drug crackdown.\n\nFormer Commission on Human Rights chairwoman Loretta Ann Rosales, however," said the high number of erring enforcers involved in raids where lives were lost in alarming levels should prompt the government to immediately suspend and review the crackdown.\n\nDuterte had rejected those calls and warned drug suspects that his campaign would be more dangerous in the final three years of his six-year presidency.

This led to the American Heart Association's recommendation to limit fat intake to less than 30% of daily calories, saturated fat to 10%, and cholesterol to less than 300 mg per day.\n\nNearly all clinical trials in the 1960s, 70s and 80s compared usual diets to those characterized by low total fat, low saturated fat, low dietary cholesterol, and increased polyunsaturated fats, says study co-author James E. Dalen, MD, MPH, Weil Foundation, and University of Arizona College of Medicine. These diets did reduce cholesterol levels. However they did not reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease deaths.\n\nCarefully analyzing studies and trials from 1957 to the present, investigators found that the whole diet approach, and specifically Mediterranean-style diets, are effective in preventing heart disease, even though they may not lower total serum or LDL cholesterol. The Mediterranean-style diet is low in animal products and saturated fat, and encourages intake of monounsaturated fats found in nuts and olive oil. In particular, the diet emphasizes consumption of vegetables, fruit, legumes, whole grains, and fish.\n\nThe potency of combining individual cardioprotective foods is substantial – and perhaps even stronger than many of the medications and procedures that have been the focus of modern cardiology, explains co-author Stephen Devries, MD, FACC, Gaples Institute for Integrative Cardiology (Deerfield, IL) and Division of Cardiology, Northwestern University (Chicago, IL). Results from trials emphasizing dietary fat reduction were a disappointment, prompting subsequent studies incorporating a whole diet approach with a more nuanced recommendation for fat intake.\n\nBased on the data from several influential studies, which are reviewed in the article, Dalen and Devries concluded that emphasizing certain food groups, while encouraging people to decrease others, is more cardioprotective and overall better at preventing heart disease than a blanket low-fat diet. Encouraging the consumption of olive oil over butter and cream, while increasing the amount of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and fish promises to be more effective.\n\nThe last fifty years of epidemiology and clinical trials have established a clear link between diet, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular events, concludes Dr. Dalen. Nutritional interventions have proven that a 'whole diet' approach with equal attention to what is consumed as well as what is excluded is more effective in preventing cardiovascular disease than low fat," low cholesterol diets.

It may be that this is partly connected to growth in smart phones and social media use,” he said.\n\nWomen in the 15- to 24-year-old age group were found to be the most lonely, with a mean loneliness score of 3.3, while men had a score of 3.0. Meanwhile, among women and men in the 65-year-old and over age bracket, these scores were 2.6 and 2.4 respectively.\n\n“It used to be the case that older people were most lonely, but there is a turning point around 2008 to 2009 when we see rates of loneliness for the 15 to 24 age group start to rise. There has been a continuous increase since then,” Mr. Botha said.\n\nExplaining the rise in loneliness, Mr. Botha observed it could be that young people are now more likely to “report and admit they have emotional issues,” adding “That’s a good thing.”\n\nThey also found that overall psychological distress has risen over time, according to the data.\n\nWomen were more psychologically distressed than men between 2007 and 2021. In men, psychological distress rose by 51 percent in this time frame. However, among women, it rose by 63 percent.\n\nPsychological distress in young people aged 15 to 24 rose to 42.3 percent in 2021, more than double the 18.4 percent recorded in 2011.\n\nThe study also found 14.1 percent of people aged over 15 have tried electronic cigarettes and vaping devices.\n\nFurther," it found that marriage has fallen from 56.3 percent in 2001 to 50.3 percent in 2021. De facto relationships have increased from 9 percent to 14.7 percent in this timeframe.

The Knights winning the match by 134 runs. The only bright spot of the batting was 18 runs scored by Brendan Smallbone. There were good bowling performances by Niaz Ali (three wickets for 26 runs), Mohammed Gazanfar (two for four) and Waqas Khan (two for six).\n\nNiaz Ali, captain of the LSW team, was pleased with the result.\n\n“It’s a young team and really good work. All of the middle order did well, especially Waqas [Khan] who played really well and the guys in the lower order all chipped in, that was the main thing,” he explained. “The bowlers were on target, we had a plan worked out, we stuck to our plan and definitely it came good for us.”\n\nVagabonds, having played two matches now, heads the Hong Kong Cricket Association Karp Sunday Championship League ladder with nine points, while LSW Knights," KCC and USRC/Millennium are all equal on five points after one match.\n\nHKCC Scorpions host LSW JKN at HKCG and USRC/Millennium play Pakistan Association AMSUA at Mission Road on Oct 21.\n\nThe Epoch Times publishes in 35 countries and in 19 languages.

This easy blueberry crumb cake is deliciously simple. The light and fluffy cake is packed with juicy blueberries and loaded with cinnamon crumble. Enjoy a slice of this homemade cake for breakfast or dessert with coffee. Find this recipe and more on my blog HERE:  https://sugarylogic.com/easy-blueberry-crumb-cake/\n\nThere is nothing like a fluffy,,,, and cinnamon. Pour in the melted butter and stir until everything has combined and crumbles. Refrigerate the crumb topping until it is needed.PREP THE BLUEBERRIES - Toss the blueberries in a tablespoon of flour until coated, and set aside.\n\nMAKE THE CAKE - Mix the dry ingredients in a separate bowl. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Alternately add the dry ingredients and the sour cream, starting and ending with the dry, and mix until combined. Fold in the blueberries. BAKE - Pour the cake batter into a greased and lined 8x8-inch baking pan. Cover with the streusel and bake.Swap the sour cream for Greek yogurt or buttermilk.Add one to two teaspoons of lemon juice and a tablespoon of lemon zest to the batter for a lemon blueberry cake.Store this cake in an airtight container or keep it in its pan and tightly wrap the top with foil. This blueberry crumb cake can be left at room temperature for two to three days or in the refrigerator for up to five days.\n\nUse room temperature ingredients (eggs and butter) for the best incorporation and a smooth batter. Chill the streusel until you are ready to use it - this keeps the butter cold until it hits the oven.Toss the blueberries in flour before adding them to the cake batter to keep them from sinking to the bottom of the cake.Grease and line the baking pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking. The parchment paper also makes it easy to remove the cake from the pan for easy slicing.Serve the cake while still subtly warm for the best flavor experience.Can you use frozen blueberries in crumb cake?You can use frozen berries in this recipe.

Here are a variety of ways in which the U.S. political system suffered near total organ failure.The U.S. electorate begged for real policy in 2020, in areas as diverse as pandemic management, innovation strategies, economic renewal, climate change, rural revitalization, poverty amelioration, race relations, policing, the management of dissent, and a resurgent China. What we got instead was thin rhetoric and emotion from both sides.The progressive wing of the Democrats brough forward dramatic policy proposals, but Joe Biden and Kamala Harris pushed these concepts (like the Green New Deal) into the electoral shadows. President Donald Trump spoke often about what he would not do if re-elected, but his policy book was distressingly thin. The 2020 election was waged over values, thinly described, and not ideas.The media coverage of the 2020 election was far from dispassionate and professionally disengaged, and they wore their contempt for President Trump on their front pages. The smaller number of media outlets, such as Fox News, that supported President Trump, in turn, took a similar approach to the treatment of the Democrats. In the days leading up to the election, with some unenthusiastic hedging of bets, the vast majority of media commentators assumed Biden would win.Election night coverage showed how little the professional analysts understood what was going on in the country and how disconnected the media are from the main currents of political thought in the United States. In the end, the core point is that the U.S. media, in particular, neither leads, reflects, nor influences the public will in the United States.For the second U.S. election in a row, and with other international examples, the polling industry let the side down. Despite the expenditure of tens of millions of dollars on professional polling, the results didn’t mesh with the forecasts. There were, obviously, points of overlap and convergence between votes and polls, but as a guide to voter intentions, the polls were more misleading than helpful. As an after-the-fact description of what happened, in contrast, sophisticated polling can help explain the inexplicable and the unanticipated. As a predictive enterprise, however, we may have seen the last of heavy reliance on polls.For several decades, commentators have decried the growing importance of money in U.S. politics. The amount of money is obscene in financial and political terms, particularly when the expenditures by the political action committees and super PACs are added to the mix. But the spending was not very effective. Surprisingly, the Democrats mobilized tens of millions of dollars for key districts, only to produce disappointing results. Massive sums were spent to defeat—or support—President Trump.It may be increasingly difficult to get donors to write so many big checks in the future. The failure of big money may convince millions of small donors to stop responding to the endless stream of fundraising emails.Many people made millions of dollars off electoral processes that, in the end, had surprisingly little impact on political outcomes. At some point, an enterprising journalist will follow the money and find out how the political donations were spent, often to little positive effect.The Democrats did an excellent job of rounding up celebrity endorsements, including from many athletes, musicians, and television and movie stars. The admirable efforts by professional athletes to get out the vote probably did convince more people to go to the polls but didn’t produce the clearly desired Democratic sweep. The messages from the stars played well with the Democrats’ political base, but failed to sway close to half the voters in the United States. By shedding all pretense of political impartiality, and by lining up so strongly against almost half the American electorate, they have managed to politicize popular culture and professional sports in a way that will resonate for years.The 2020 strategy emphasized political ridicule at a remarkable level. President Trump dumped endless scorn on former Vice President Biden, but almost half of all American voters didn’t reject the Democratic candidate on account of the harsh comments. Biden, in turn, described the president in consistently derogatory terms. But, again, the verbal abuse didn’t stick, as the president’s share of the popular vote suggests. This applies to the media as well. The anti-Trump contempt of virtually all TV comedians would, in historical circumstances, probably have been enough to turn the election. That didn’t happen this time. People watch and listen to the critical attacks, but the attacks clearly didn’t sway the election.Since the election of Donald Trump in 2016, the academy has wrestled with the Republican president, his erratic behavior, and his quixotic policies. In the hypersensitive world of cancel culture and exceptional concern about ethnicity, race, gender, and human sexuality, Trump represented the antithesis of the value system in the university and college system. The collective academic effort to get rid of Trump was more than palpable; it had become a central pillar of intellectual engagement. And despite hundreds of academic speeches, lectures, op-eds, books, scholarly articles, and other interventions, the political needle in the United States barely budged. While Trump and Republicans railed against the perceived left-wing bias in the academy, ironically it appears that they over-estimated the influence and impact of academic interventions.The two main parties—the Democrats and the Republicans—used to be the foundations of American political stability. They varied little in substantive policies, moderated regional and other differences, and provided a counterbalance to the aspirations of presidents, senators, congressmembers, and special interests. They no longer serve that function.The Democrats are bitterly divided among themselves, united temporarily by a hatred for President Trump. The Republican desire to hold on to power caused many key leaders to surrender their independence to Donald Trump.Instead of being a source for constructive ideas and political moderation, the parties have become ideological battlegrounds (the Democrats) or facilitators of a strong leader (the GOP). It’s not clear that they’re deeply connected with the American people, and they don’t appear to be outlets for any electoral aspirations other than self-interest.Through 2019–2020, the U.S. election was going to be about the political redemption of African Americans. This was the first test of Black Lives Matter and came in the wake of countless public attestations that animosity toward African Americans had been relegated to the past. African Americans mobilized around the call to action—led by professional athletes, actors, thousands of African American leaders, school kids, and community activists. And, even if Biden emerges as the eventual winner, it was really all for naught. Almost half of the American electorate chose not to rebuke a president who apparently stood in the way of the improvement of life opportunities for African Americans. It’s hard not imagine a withdrawal of African Americans from electoral politics and a growing sense of dissatisfaction with the American status quo.The United States has one of the strangest national electoral systems in the world. Put aside the unusual Electoral College system and consider instead the absence of a national electoral system. Focus on the fact that counties, not states and not the U.S. government, run elections. The 2020 election was the culmination of thousands of local-level electoral processes. The complex web of rules, procedures, operations, and management styles creates confusion and uncertainty. It’s hardly a top-flight demonstration of a democratic election, and it’s revealed structural weaknesses in U.S. politics.In the Bush–Gore election of 2000, the crucial decision was made not in the ballot box but by the Supreme Court. In the ultra-tight 2020 election, and with Trump and his supporters demanding judicial protection, the courts will once again likely provide for a continuation of the campaign into the coming weeks.With President Trump having filled many of the nation’s courtrooms with Republican-friendly judges, the assumption is that the courts could provide the GOP candidate with further support. To the degree that this is tested—and true—it’s a degradation of the credibility and integrity of the legal system in the United States.There’s probably too much to hope that the United States will wake up, post-election, and alter the controversial processes that lie ahead. As the country stares into the black hole of presidential uncertainty, and with the Republicans narrowly holding the Senate, the political quagmire of 2020 is certain to spread into 2021 and beyond.The United States suffered a system breakdown in November 2020 that brought to the surface the vulnerabilities and shortcomings of a deeply flawed political structure. Uncertainty reigns supreme, and prospects for greater political chaos, disharmony," and conflict loom over the United States and the whole world.Ken Coates is a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and the Canada research chair in regional innovation at the University of Saskatchewan.Views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Epoch Times.Ken Coates is a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and the Canada research chair in regional innovation at the University of Saskatchewan.Authoritarianism and the Future of Technology\n\nCopyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

I didn’t think much of ”Hu & Wen’s new politics“ at the time because they and previous leaders all come from the same dictatorial party and are all brainwashed by the same party culture. In some ways, Hu is worse than others. For example, Hu often goes to worship at the (1)”Holy land of the Communist Party.“ One can see he is very conservative and has no idea what the rest of the world is doing and what direction China should take. He does everything to maintain the dictatorship.”\n\nAfter reading Wang’s open letter Li said, “Being a standing member of a Provincial Political Consultative Committee, Wang is a man of courage and conscience- he couldn’t have written this letter without either. In the letter, Wang mentioned sensitive issues such as Falun Gong, the June 4th Massacre, and environmental protection.”\n\n“Every year in the Political Consultative Conference, issues in Wang’s letter are unlikely to be discussed at the conference. Being a member, he is truly patriotic and everything he’s bottled up for years exploded. His letter won applause from so many people because everyone is suppressed under the rule of the CCP.”\n\nWang calls for the immediate stop to the suppression of Falun Gong in his open letter. He then suggests punishing those who initiated the suppression and offering victims state compensation. Li talked about his own personal experience with Falun Gong, “When I was imprisoned in the Guizhou National Security prison, an inmate told me he had personal contact with Falun Gong practitioners in the prison since 2005 and felt they are very nice and benevolent people.”\n\n“During the two years I was in prison and after I was released, I can say, except for a few very muddle-headed people, most people don’t have ill impressions of Falun Gong. People generally say the practitioners are kind and do not endanger society.”\n\nLi continued, “Wang mentioned to punish those who started the persecution against Falun Gong, I agree. Killers should be punished by the law. Having the CCP redress Falun Gong is like letting the killer redress the one who was killed; it is absolutely of no meaning.”\n\nLi is a former reporter for Bijie Daily based in Guizhou Province. Li published four articles on overseas websites and was sentenced to two years for subversion. He was released on September 24, 2007. The four articles he published are “A one-hundred-year-old man joins the CCP,” “Adding the U. S. Passport to Your Thoughts,” “Born Commonly and Die Pathetically,” and “A Secretary Who Continues His Meeting After Being Notified of His Mother’s Death.”\n\n(1) The “Holy land of the Communist Party” is Yan An City in Shaanxi Province," where the CCP hid during the Sino-Japan war. It is the place where Mao consolidated his power and finally took over China.

Effective Jan. 15,,,, regardless of its  size, according to the notice  originally posted onto Sina.com’s real  estate section.   The  average sales price for commercial residential housing in Wuhan last  year was 6,184 yuan (US $938.96) per square meter, an increase of 17.44  percent compared with the year before.\n\nWhen the news reached Qingdao, Sun, on staff with the Good Friend  Housing Service Company told Voice of America  (VOA), “Qingdao’s housing  price will only rise, not fall, because no more houses can be bought in  good locations. This restriction can only target high-priced homes and will even be  extended to the suburbs. Residential housing can only rise, and it will  not fall until the next century. As for those high-quality houses,  costing 30,000 to 40,000 yuan (US $4,556.58 to $6,075.25) per square  meter—even if you lower it to 20,000 yuan (US $3,038) people still  cannot afford it.”\n\nThe Chinese Academy of Sciences predicted that in 2011, house prices in  China will continue to rise by as much as 12.7 percent. It is expected  to be linked with China’s consumer price index, which is estimated to  rise 3.7 percent.\n\nMost Chinese cannot afford residential homes, yet low-rent and other  economical houses that are supposed to assist low-income families have  been snapped up by the rich.\n\nThe ruling Party’s mouthpiece Xinhua News reported that there’s no  telling how many “distinguished” people are living in these low-income  houses; some BMW and Mercedes-Benz owners are also trying to acquire  these kinds of houses.\n\nClose to 90 percent of the applicants for low-income houses in Shanghang  of Fujian province in 2010 are public servants. Some of their names  even appear multiple times on the applicant list, according to the VOA  article.\n\nIn 2010, the State Council launched a series of housing market  regulations; in addition to home buying restrictions, there were also  measures including: suspending loans for the purchase of a third  property, increasing the down payment, and limiting the maximum loan  amount on residential housing.\n\nYet having so many regulatory policies still cannot keep rising prices  under control. Chinese media reported that officials from China’s  Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Construction said in an internal  meeting in mid-January that they would pressure local officials to  impose restrictions.\n\nFinancial commentator Ni Jinjie wrote that, based on the effect of the  regulations in 2010, the measures are merely a formality. Since the root  cause of uncontrollable house prices is that local governments are  important beneficiaries, naturally the regulations were not implemented  strictly.\n\nTakings from land sales soared 70 percent last year, and this form of  easy lucre has become the most important source of revenue for many  local governments.\n\nNi’s article stated that currency flooding and land financing are the  two main factors supporting China’s real estate bubble. In the past two  years, China’s state-owned banks gave out 17 trillion yuan (US $2.58  trillion) in new loans; during the time when the real economy was  sinking and manufacturing margins were thin, this money flowed into real  estate.\n\nFor local governments, land is still their largest source of revenue.  Since local officials’ promotion is tied to the local GDP performance,  “land sales” weigh much more than people’s livelihood and affordable  housing.\n\nLiu Feiyue, in charge of the Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch website,  told VOA that the authorities did not dig out the root of the problem,  because the government itself is the beneficiary of high housing prices.\n\n“The most fundamental problem is the profit chain,” Liu said. “Not only  local governments," but the central government also benefits tremendously  from it.”\n\nChinese Try to Cope with Soaring Prices\n\nCopyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

It reported a list of negative effects such as the reduced access to medical care, weight gain and increased cigarette and alcohol consumption. Physical activity decreased by 29.8%, a vital preventative to further physical and psychological problems.\n\nThis study highlights that people living with diabetes require greater support during pandemics to maintain exercise and protect their physical and mental health. National health services should use these data and future studies to implement better social care around supporting people with pre-existing conditions, said Dr. Jashi.\n\nIn the second study, Dr. Chiara Simeoli reported data collected during the last three weeks of the mass quarantine lasted 2 months in Italy, in a web-survey-based, multicenter, case-control research involving 12 different Italian centers. The study confirmed that a large cohort of 478 patients with hypocortisolism, and particularly, 363 with adrenal insufficiency and 115 with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adequately treated with glucocorticoids, showed higher anxiety and depression, associated with a dissatisfaction feeling of self and a reduced resiliency, when compared with Italian healthy controls, suggesting the detrimental impact of social isolation on mental health of these patients, particularly frail and vulnerable to infections and stress. Moreover, patients with adrenal insufficiency reported a worse quality of life than patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n\nThese findings confirmed that beyond the huge impact on physical health, COVID-19 epidemic, social isolation and mass quarantine represent significant psychological stressors, causing severe effects on mental health, even more on people with pre-existing conditions. An empowerment of psychological counseling for these vulnerable patients during COVID-19 should be considered by national health-care services," adds Dr. Simeoli.\n\nBoth studies indicate that additional larger studies over a longer period of time are needed for further investigation.

The General Classification contenders were not going to let any rider who presented even the slightest threat get away.\n\nFourteen riders finally got away: Enrico Barbin and Francesco Bongiorno (Bardiani-CSF,) Francis Mourey (FDJ,) Perrig Quemeneur, Björn Thurau and Romain Sicard (Europcar,) Georg Preidler (Giant-Shimano,) Eduard Vorganov and Daniel Moreno (Katusha,) Philip Deignan (Sky,) Nicolas Roche and Ivan Rovny (Tinkoff-Saxo,) Yonathan Monsalve (Neri Sottoli,) and Moreno Moser (Cannondale.)\n\nThis group opened a gap of about five minutes, splitting and reforming. As there were no GC contenders in the break, BMC didn’t bother chasing. Instead, Androni Giocattoli, one of the few smaller teams which missed the break, did its best to chase down the escapees.\n\nThis escape group stayed away and worked together until it hit the day’s final climb, 34 km from the finish, when four riders attacked the break and Trek’s Julian Arredondo attacked the peloton and joined the four 32.8 km from the end, with a 35-second gap.\n\nThis group added and dropped riders; Arredondo led a quartet of Franco Pellizotti (Androni,) Pierre Rolland (Europcar,) Georg Preidler (Giant-Shimano,) and Alberto Losada (Katusha) over the top of the climb at 28 km, but by 24 km the peloton had swept up everyone ahead on the long descent.\n\nMichael Rogers attacked on the descent, 21 km from the line and quickly opened a 500-meter gap on the peloton. This gap stretched to as much as 44 seconds, then shrank steadily. The final 3.5 kilometers of the stage were flat, and the final half-kilometer slightly uphillt, but Rogers had the legs and the will to make up for the first half of his season.\n\nBMC’s Cadel Evans remains in the race leader’s pink jersey, with 50 seconds over Omega Pharma-Quickstep’s Rigoberto Uran and 70 seconds on Tinkoff-Saxo’s Rafal Majka.\n\nStage 12 is a 42-km individual time trial, with a Cat 4 climb in the first third and another good lump at the end," and with an uphill finish.

Of inquiries to 124 children's hospitals, a response was received from 105 (85 percent). Of these respondents, 72 percent had DCD policies, 19 percent were developing policies, and 7 percent neither had nor were developing policies.\n\nThe researchers received and analyzed 73 approved policies. Sixty-one (84 percent) specify criteria or tests for declaring death, including electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, pulselessness, apnea, and unresponsiveness. Four policies require total waiting periods prior to organ recovery at variance with professional guidelines: 1 less than 2 minutes and 3 longer than 5 minutes. Sixty-four policies (88 percent) preclude transplant personnel from declaring death and 51 percent prohibit them from involvement in premortem (taking place immediately before death) management.\n\nWhile 65 policies (89 percent) indicate the importance of palliative care, only 7 percent recommend or require palliative care consultation. Thirty-two policies (44 percent) preclude the use of medications with the intention to hasten death.\n\nPolicies differ in the location of withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. Sixty-eight policies (93 percent) specify the location, with the majority (54 percent) requiring withdrawal of treatment to occur in the operating room. Other potential locations include areas adjacent to the operating room (19 percent), the emergency department (4 percent), or the intensive care unit (4 percent).\n\nThis study demonstrates that, consistent with a national emphasis on increasing the supply of transplantable organs, a large number of children's hospitals have developed or are developing DCD policies, the authors write.\n\nThe policies exhibit notable variation both within those we studied and compared with authoritative reports and statements. Further research will be required to determine the importance of variation in the tests for declaring death or the processes for withdrawing life-sustaining treatment. In the long run," public policy may need to address strategies to promote adherence to recommendations for DCD processes based on sufficient clinical evidence and/or ethical justification.

Swiss media reported she was a member of the country’s diplomatic service.\n\nThe suspect told reporters he went into a forest on Tuesday to try to find rare plants to sell, but was unsuccessful.\n\nOn his way back, he said he passed a waterfall and saw Sauvain-Weisskopf. He said he strangled her from behind, and that she resisted for a while before losing consciousness.\n\nHe then covered her with a black sheet, which was found nearby, took 300 baht ($9) from her backpack and threw her sneakers away. He said his motivation was because he had no money and no work due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe cause of death has not been confirmed, and an autopsy report has yet to be released by the authorities, said Kissana Phathanacharoen, a national police deputy spokesperson.\n\nThe incident has cast a pall over Thailand’s so-called Phuket Sandbox program to try and bring fully vaccinated foreign tourists to the popular destination," which has been struggling massively during the coronavirus pandemic.

The salt water acts as a humidifier and keeps the nasal lining hydrated. It helps in clearing out mucus and irritants in the nasal passage (3).\n\nCaution: Do not use table salt as it may contain other additives that can irritate the nasal mucosa further.\n\nMix the salt with the water and pour this into the spray bottle. Bend your head towards the floor and spritz the salt water a few times into the nasal cavities. You can also take some of the saline water in your palm and inhale it so that it reaches as far as possible in the sinus cavities. Blow it out after 10 seconds. You can also purchase empty nasal spray bottles. Most drugstores sell saline nasal sprays over the counter.\n\nVitamin E oil is a good dry nostril remedy as it helps increase the hydration of the skin and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (4), (5). A study shows that alpha-tocopherol (a type of vitamin E) could help in the treatment of pollen-induced allergic rhinitis (6). Hence, it may hydrate the nasal mucosa, relieve dryness, and accelerate the healing process of the nasal passages.\n\nTilt your head upwards and pour two to three drops of the oil into the nostrils.\n\nOlive oil, like coconut oil, hydrates the skin inside the nasal passages, thus alleviating the dryness (7). It also relieves irritation and swelling (8).\n\nUsing the dropper, pour a few drops of olive oil into the nostrils.\n\nThe vitamin E content of sesame oil is higher than that of most other oils. It is a great moisturizer for dry skin. In a study, sesame oil was proven to work better than the saline irrigation method to relieve nasal dryness (9).\n\nTilt your head backward and pour a drop of sesame oil in each nostril. Inhale deeply so that the oil reaches the internal nasal passages.\n\nThe easiest way to get rid of a dry nose is to inhale steam at regular intervals. This soothing remedy softens the dried mucus in the nasal passages (10).\n\nPour the hot water in the bowl. Cover your head with the towel and inhale the steam from the bowl for about 10 minutes. Blow your nose gently after this.\n\nDryness in the environment can worsen a dry nose and trigger congestion. Maintaining humidity in the room where you spend most of the day is a necessity in frigid weather conditions. Low humidity, cold weather, and seasonal change can cause nasal congestion, runny nose, and breathing difficulty.\n\nHumidifiers or vaporizers are one of the best home remedies for dry noses and are used to add moisture to the surroundings and can ease symptoms, such as irritation in the nose and dryness (11). In the absence of humidifiers, water-filled buckets can be placed near heating systems to create ambient humidity.\n\nWho doesn’t love a sauna bath? It is one of the best ways to treat dry nose and sore muscles. If you don’t prefer a sauna bath, simply heat a bath, add a few drops of aroma oil to it, and soak in its goodness for a few minutes. Do not stay in long unless you wish to get a leaky nose in exchange for a dry one.\n\nOne remedy that people often tend to resort to for obtaining relief from a dry nose is using petroleum jelly. However, this remedy is not recommended by doctors. The internal application of petroleum jelly has been linked to a type of pneumonia (12). Hence, steer clear of this home remedy.\n\nUsing a saline solution with neti pot helps cleanse the nasal cavity and remove inflammation-causing substances from the nostrils (13).\n\nYou Will Need\n\nWhat You Have To Do\n\nMix the non-iodized salt in lukewarm water to prepare the saline solution.  Stand over a sink with your head tilted sideward at a 45-degree angle. Place the neti pot’s spout into your upper nostril while breathing through your mouth. Slowly pour the saline solution into the upper nostril so that it can drain from the lower nostril. Remove the neti pot and bring your head up. Breathe through both nostrils to clear out your nose. Repeat the same process for the other nostril.\n\nHow Often You Should Do This\n\nThe common causes of a dry nose range from air conditioning and dehydration to the side effects of medications, such as decongestants and antihistamines.\n\nA dry nose results in nasal irritation, itching, swelling, wheezing, and nosebleeds. When this dryness lasts for more than 10 days, you should consult your doctor as it may indicate serious underlying conditions, such as Sjogren’s syndrome. Also, if you experience symptoms related to infections, such as high fever, nonstop bleeding, and lethargy, consult your doctor immediately.\n\nWhat are the potential complications of a dry nose?\n\nThe potential complications of a dry nose include dry skin, blurred vision, skin rashes, wheezing, and other breathing problems.\n\nWhat to eat and avoid to relieve a dry nose?\n\n•  Drink enough fluids. The depletion of body fluids makes the body tissues dry. Plenty of water is required to make the nasal tissues work efficiently. Drink a minimum of eight to ten glasses of water per day.\n\n•  Having hot and spicy food or liquid items, for example, chicken soup, can moisten the nostrils and give you some relief.\n\n•  Reduce your caffeine, alcohol, and salt intake as these are dehydrating agents. If you have a dry nose, avoid consuming these foods.\n\n•  Cut down on any medication that increases the dryness after consulting your doctor. Medications tend to dehydrate the body, which often causes dry nasal passages. Keep your body properly hydrated if you need to take a high dose of medicine due to any existing illness.\n\nCan I put Vicks in my nose?\n\nNo. The camphor in Vicks may be toxic to the body if absorbed through the mucous membrane, especially among children (14). In addition," petroleum-oil-based products such as Vicks Vapourub may cause exogenous lipoid pneumonia (a type of pneumonia caused by inhalation of fatty substances) (15).\n\nLearn how to prevent and manage a dry nose with simple tips and tricks listed in this video.

By October, the pharmacy was synchronizing the medications of about 400 patients and seeing results in increased refill revenue and continually improving Star Ratings measures.\n\nTarrytown Pharmacy’s prescription volume is in the top 5% of pharmacies in central Texas, owner Mark Newberry said. Although three chain pharmacies or mass merchandise stores are within two miles, in the past decade his pharmacy’s biggest competition has come from mail-order pharmacy. He knows that proving his pharmacy can help keep customers healthier is key to winning business from health plans.\n\n“We are moving to a five-star quality model,” Newberry said, with pharmacies becoming paid based on performance. That’s good news for independent pharmacies, he said. “We can finally show that we do things better than the chains.” By building a network of pharmacies with top pharmacy quality performance, Newberry said, “I think Health Mart is going to improve our reputation and position with health plans.”\n\nHealth Mart’s Get In Sync program can help lead member pharmacies through every step of setting up a successful program, also providing members with a comprehensive and practical “Medication Synchronization Playbook.” Find out more in the Medication Synchronization Education Center," sponsored by Health Mart®.

I’m imploring the premiers and our mayors to please do the right thing: Act now to protect public health. If you think something is missing in the support we’re offering for your citizens, tell us.”\n\nThat message did not sit well with all premiers. Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe said it was “extremely unhelpful” for the prime minister to frame the issue as a “false choice” between protecting Canadians’ health and protecting the economy.\n\nStill," officials said Thursday’s conference call was collegial and constructive. The readout added that “all first ministers reiterated their support for the Team Canada approach to fighting COVID-19.”	P	2024-02-11 20:10:34	2024-02-11 20:43:01",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And two, we knew going in that rods 'bleach,' or become ineffective, when exposed to very bright light, so it was thought that rods couldn't be involved in setting our clocks at all in intense light. But they are.\n\nIn the study, Hattar's team used a group of mice which were genetically modified to have only rod photoreceptors, meaning their cones and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells -- both of them light-sensitive cells in the animals' retinas -- were not functional. The team then exposed the rodents to varying intensities of light, measuring the animals' responding level of activity by how often they ran on hamster wheels.\n\nThe study results are important because they indicate that prolonged exposure to dim or low light at night (such as that in homes and office buildings) can influence mammals' biological clocks and throw off their sleep-wake cycles. Hattar suggested that one way people can mitigate this effect is to make sure to get some exposure to bright day light every day. (The exposure to brighter, natural daylight will firmly reset the clocks to a proper asleep-at-night-awake-in-the-day cycle.)\n\nIn addition, the study has possible implications for older people being cared for in nursing homes and hospitals, he said.\n\nOlder adults often lose their rod cells to age, which means that their caretakers would be well advised to regularly and deliberately expose them to bright natural daylight in order to make sure that their natural, biological rhythms remain in sync so their sleep-wake cycles remain accurately set, Hattar said. Otherwise, they could have sleep disturbances, such as intermittent waking or difficulty falling asleep," not to mention the impact on their appetite and other bodily functions.

That’s up 4 percent from a year ago, helped by a drop in expenses.\n\nLike Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, Citi has been looking to cut expenses in its consumer banking division through branch closures, layoffs and other measures. The bank had 15 percent fewer branches than it did a year ago, Citi said.\n\nCiti saw a drop in trading revenue compared to the first quarter, in line with other major banks, as financial markets became less volatile. Fixed income, currency and commodity trading revenue declined 12 percent from the first quarter to $3.06 billion, while stock trading revenue fell 25 percent.\n\nCiti Holdings, the bank’s so-called “bad bank” that holds the bad mortgages and other toxic securities left over from the financial crisis, made a modest profit in the quarter of $157 million compared with the $3.4 billion loss the business had a year ago.\n\nCiti has been winding down and selling off assets in Citi Holdings for several years. Since last year, the division has been making small profits each quarter. Assets in Citi Holdings were $116 billion, down 22 percent from a year earlier.\n\nUnder CEO Michael Corbat, Citi has been trying to become a slimmer, more efficient company and so far, the strategy is working. The bank passed the Federal Reserve’s so-called stress test earlier this year, after failing in 2014. Citi was able to raise its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share in March, the bank’s first increase since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nNet revenue at the bank totaled $19.47 billion, compared with $19.43 billion in the same period a year earlier.\n\nCitigroup’s stock rose $1.52, or 2.7 percent," to $57.99 in early morning trading.

If investors aren’t confident about property, they will put their money into other assets, and rental queues will remain long.\n\n“The reforms announced today strike the right balance for owners and tenants. The next step will be to work through the detail of these measures, and we will continue to advocate for practical and pragmatic approaches to their implementation.”\n\nPerth’s rental vacancy rate in April 2022 was 1.2 percent, up from 1 percent the year prior.\n\n“Our housing is more affordable than other states, and our tenants tend to spend a shorter time in the rental market before moving onto home ownership,” said Hart.\n\nThe bill also looked to close the loopholes in the existing ban on solicited rent bidding to include landlords and third parties, and create a portable bond scheme to reduce strain on renters. A ban on secret rent bidding will also be implemented by requiring landlords and agents to notify applicants of other offers from other prospective tenants that are higher than the advertised price.\n\nThe NSW government is also looking to end ‘no-grounds’ evictions, make it easier to have pets," and better protect renters’ personal information.\n\n“These changes will create a fairer rental regime in this state by providing greater certainty as well as flexibility for both renters and owners.”	P	2024-02-11 20:10:34	2024-02-11 20:40:06",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You tend to use several variations of your child’s name; some are meaningful, while others are simply adorable sounds. Here are a few nicknames you can begin with for the name Taliesin.\n\nWestern astrology includes the construction of a horoscope based on the person’s exact time of birth and location to understand the positions of the planet, stars, and zodiac signs at that time.  However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date. There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year.

One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth. There are 27 nakshatras, each with its own unique qualities, attributes, and symbolism. Each rashi contains two-and-one-fourth nakshatras in it. For example, Aries contains Ashwini, Bharani, and Krithika nakshatras.\tThe below table provides information on the nakshatras’ degrees on the zodiac circle, their lords and related syllables, for babies born in the Tula (Libra) rashi.

S. sanctions.\n\nA Sunday report by Iranian state television cited anonymous “informed” sources claiming that Tehran would free four Americans accused of spying in exchange for four Iranians held in the United States and the release of the frozen funds.\n\nState Department spokesman Ned Price told The Epoch Times on Monday that no such deal had been struck.\n\n“Reports that a prisoner swap deal has been reached are not true,,,, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation charity, was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 and later convicted of plotting to overthrow its regime, charges she denies.\n\nIran and world powers are holding talks to revive the 2015 nuclear accord that President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of three years ago. Trump believed that the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—known commonly as the Iran nuclear deal—was not decisive enough in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Besides pulling out of the deal in 2018, Trump restored and augmented sanctions to try to force Iran into renegotiating the pact with more concessions.\n\nTrump argued that the Obama-era deal failed to address Iran’s destabilizing influence in the Middle East and the development of its ballistic missile program.\n\nAfter Trump pulled out of the deal, Iran violated some of the pact’s nuclear restrictions.\n\nPresident Joe Biden came into office saying that getting back into the accord was a priority. But Iran and the United States have disagreed over Iran’s demands that sanctions be lifted first, and the stalemate threatened to become an early foreign policy setback for the Biden administration.\n\nTehran and the powers have been meeting in Vienna since early April to work on steps that must be taken to bring Washington and Tehran back into deal, touching on U. S. sanctions and Iran’s breaches of the 2015 pact.\n\nIran says that, under the U. S. sanctions imposed in 2018, some $20 billion of its oil revenue has been frozen in a number of countries.\n\nIran’s top negotiator in Vienna, Abbas Araghchi, pressed Teheran’s position that all sanctions be removed, according to Iran’s official news agency.\n\n“Our red line is that all sanctions reimposed and those imposed under different labels must be lifted,” Araghchi said.\n\n“There is still a fair distance to travel to close the remaining gaps,” he said on ABC’s “This Week” program. “And those gaps are over what sanctions the United States and other countries will roll back. They are over what nuclear restrictions Iran will accept on its program to ensure that they can never get a nuclear weapon.”\n\nSullivan added that U. S. diplomats would continue negotiating over the coming weeks “to try to arrive at a mutual return to the JCPOA," which is the Iran nuclear deal on a compliance-for-compliance basis.”	P	2024-02-11 20:10:34	2024-02-11 20:38:24",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have been having unprotected sex the whole time we have been together.  I have been loyal to him and he knows everything.  I don't hide anything from him.  He doesn't hide anything from me either so he tells me everything too.  About three weeks ago,,,,  almost like it was almost closed up.  I began to worry bad and called my mom to the restroom to have a look and see if she knows what it may be.  She was in complete discuss and new it was not normal down their in my genital area.  She took me to the er cause I had no time for an appointment and it was the most horrible thing she has ever seen.  We get to the er,  and they take me back,  ask me questions about my sex life and how many partners I have been with,  etc...  They did a swob test and took my urine sample.  After the doctor got done looking down their and examining,  he automatically said he don't want to assume but that looks like a case of genital herpes type 2. I was horrified cause I've never been prone to STDs nor had a reaction like this.  He said he test for chlamydia and gonorrhea also. I haven't got the test results back cause I went on November 23, 2016. They wrote me out tramadol for pain and acyclovir for five times a day.  Taking my meds as directed it's cleared up but another outbreak will most likely happen from what the doctor told me.  What I'm confused about is when I told my boyfriend I had genital herpes type 2, I told him to go to the doctor to get checked because he is the only one I've been sleeping with and seeing and I had to have caught it from him.  He said he's done been checked and it came back negative but he will go back and get checked.  He went this morning and it still came back negative.  Can STD show up multiple negatives before an accurate positive or what cause I've never had no sort of STD my whole life and it all started happening when I got with my boyfriend now.  Could he have it and the test just be innacturate or what cause I'm clueless.  Please,  anyone,"  give me a guide or something. I'm only 18 and I'm so confused!!

Upon Erin’s arrival, after a decade of trying to get pregnant, the couple was “over the moon” to welcome their baby girl into the world.\n\nAs of April 13,2020, Wayne maintains that his daughter is only alive due to the sterling efforts of the staff at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital. “All of the doctors and nurses have been really incredible and both Emma and I want to thank them from the bottom of our hearts for all they have done for Erin,” said Wayne.\n\n“Never could we have wished for more kind and caring people to be looking after our baby,” the father continued. “They are all putting their own lives at risk for little reward. We are eternally grateful to them.”\n\nWayne described the months leading up to baby Erin’s CCP virus diagnosis as “the lowest of the low,” adding that he and Emma had become accustomed to hearing that they may lose their daughter. However, since Erin has already beaten the odds so many times, Wayne reflected, he and Emma remain positive that their little fighter can do it again.\n\n“Erin will be our first and last child,"” he said. “She really is a miracle baby for us.”	P	2024-02-11 20:10:34	2024-02-11 21:31:19",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S. government restrictions on prescription painkillers containing hydrocodone led to reduced use of opioid medications such as Vicodin,,,, San Diego Health.\n\nWe wanted to see how the legislation has impacted laboratory drug testing, said Joshua Akin, a clinical laboratory scientist.\n\nAkin and his colleagues compared nearly 254,000 urine drug test results from UC San Diego Health for 18 months before and 18 months after the DEA reclassification. They found that positive results for hydrocodone fell nearly 3 percent and positive opioid screening results decreased 0.09 percent over that time.\n\nThe findings could help guide efforts to combat the opioid addiction crisis in the United States, the researchers said.\n\nThe results suggest that reclassification reduced hydrocodone use by decreasing prescriptions for the drug. Also, it appears that tightening prescription practices for other opioids could help fight the current opioid abuse epidemic, the researchers noted.\n\nThe study was to be presented Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, in San Diego. Data and conclusions presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nIt's hard to make conclusions based on prescription data alone—sometimes patients aren't taking their medication as prescribed or are using drugs illicitly. The beauty of laboratory data is that you can't really deny the test results, Akin said in an association news release.\n\nStill, the opioid crisis is far from over. More than one out of three average Americans used a prescription opioid painkiller in 2015, federal officials reported Monday.\n\nNearly 92 million U. S. adults, or about 38 percent of the population, took a legitimately prescribed opioid like OxyContin or Percocet in 2015," according to results from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

In fact, they fired them at our escape route, trapping us with gas. The woman behind me was crying “I’m dying, I’m dying”. Your lungs burn so badly that you feel like they are bleeding,” said one of the protesters present on Taksim square at the time of the police intervention, who wished to remain anonymous for safety reasons.\n\n“Police fired tear gas bombs at the crowd at Gezi Park indiscriminately. There were people of all ages,” the protester said.\n\nIstanbul Mayor Huseyin Avni Mutlu said in a televised announcement Tuesday that “we will continue our measures in an unremitting manner, whether day or night, until marginal elements are cleared and the square is open to the people,” according to Reuters.\n\nTurkey’s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said earlier in the day, “What were we supposed to do? Kneel in front of these people and ask them remove the banners? How would those illegal rags be removed from public buildings?” according to Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily.\n\nErdogan called on protesters to “see the big picture, understand the plot, and withdraw from the streets.”\n\nSome of the protesters could be seen hurling gasoline bombs and stones at police earlier in the day.\n\nOther protesters say they distance themselves from those actions, and insist they want to have a peaceful protest.\n\nEarlier in the day police arrested 49 lawyers who had gathered at the Caglayan courthouse in Istanbul, all of them were released after being taken to the police office.\n\nThe ongoing protests reveal discontent among parts of Turkish society with Erdogan, and resemble similar protests that swept across the Arab nations in 2011. Turkey was then seen as a role model for some of the young democracies in the region.\n\nBut protesters say that Erdogan has become increasingly authoritarian and conservative in his decade long rule," citing limitations on the sale of alcohol and restrictions on free speech.

It must not attempt to erase them or replace them,” he said.\n\n“Today, with one clear voice, the United States of America calls upon the nations of the world to end religious persecution,” Trump said on Sept. 23.\n\nTrump drew criticism for scheduling his meeting on religious freedom during a climate change summit hosted by the U. N. secretary-general on Sept. 23.\n\nHe attended the climate summit for 15 minutes before leaving for his own meeting booked at a separate conference room at the UN headquarters.\n\nPastors and a number of Christian nongovernmental organizations throughout the country praised Trump for addressing the “real problem” of religious persecution.\n\nAlmost 83 percent of the world’s population live in countries with high or very high religious restrictions," according to a 2018 study by Pew Research Center.

49abd9969e6823fdc3a231e99eb0ed93,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-11-tumor-causing-cells-squishier.html#!,cells|cancer cells|Cancer|cell separation|MS-Chip,cancer|test,cells,(Medical Xpress)—A new tool developed by scientists at The Methodist Hospital separates tumor-causing cancer cells from more benign cells by subjecting the cells to a microscopic game of Plinko—except only the squishiest cells make it through.\n\nAs reported in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (early edition online),,,, the project's principal investigator. The throughput of a MS-Chip is at the level of one million cells. When a stiff cell blocks one particular barrier, many other bypasses will allow flexible cells to flow through.\n\nCancer stem cells are known to be squishier than other cancer cells. The team of scientists showed that flexible cells separated by the MS-Chip exhibited gene expression patterns consistent with cancer stem cells.\n\nMany papers indicate the presence of cancer stem cells means a worse prognosis for patients, said cancer scientist Jenny Chang, M. D., co-principal investigator and director of Methodist's Cancer Center. Yet they are not typically quantified by doctors.\n\nSubsequent analysis of separated cells by the Methodist and MD Anderson team showed the flexible cells were less likely to express cell cytoskeleton genes and more likely to express the motility genes that could contribute to metastasis.\n\nBy testing for the presence of metastatic cells, doctors may be able to tell whether cancer treatment was successful, or an as-yet untreated cancer's likelihood of metastasizing to another part of the body.\n\nA growing awareness of cancer stem cells' role in cancer metastasis and recurrence and has been frustrated by the absence of technology that makes this knowledge useful to doctors and their patients. Up to now, there has been no way of quickly and reliably separating and identifying the more dangerous tumor-causing cells from a biopsy.\n\nThe new device, which was developed at Methodist, successfully enriched tumor-causing cells from a mixture of cancer cells. It is called the Mechanical Separation Chip, or MS-Chip. Cells separated by the device can be easily collected and studied. The current standard for cell separation, flow cytometry, is relatively slow and relies on cell surface biomarkers.\n\nOur microfluidics cell separation via MS-Chip provides a high throughput method that can particularly sort cells to different levels of stiffness, which opens a new avenue to study stiffness related cellular and molecular biology, Qin said. Downstream molecular analysis, including genomic and proteomic profiling of the cell subtypes, provides an approach to identifying new biomarkers relevant to cancer stem cells and cancer metastasis.\n\nRight now, each MS-Chip costs about $10 to produce.\n\nIf massively produced, MS-Chip cost could be at the level of one dollar per chip," Qin said. Running a mechanical cell separation will be even less expensive than flow cytometry cell sorting.

S. guidelines for preventing and treating HIV-associated opportunistic infections has been released by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in cooperation with the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).\n\nThe new Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents apply state-of-the-art science and medicine to 29 infectious diseases of concern. More than 140 medical experts contributed their knowledge to this edition of the guidelines,,,, these infections continue to threaten the health of many people infected with HIV, says John T. Brooks, M. D., co-author of the guidelines and leader of the HIV Clinical Epidemiology Team in CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention. It is critical that health care providers, especially newer clinicians who may have less experience with opportunistic infections, remain able to recognize the signs and symptoms of these infections and know how to provide the most effective preventive care and treatment.\n\nThe new guidelines combine what were previously two separate publications, one for the prevention of opportunistic infections (last published in 2002) and one for their treatment (first published in 2004).\n\nMajor changes to the guidelines include\n\n* Emphasis on the important role of effective antiretroviral therapy in augmenting immune function, which is pivotal to preventing and managing opportunistic infections\n\n* Information on the diagnosis and management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, a condition in which the immune system begins to recover, but then responds to a previously acquired opportunistic infection with an overwhelming inflammatory response that worsens the symptoms of infection\n\n* Information on the prevention and treatment of hepatitis B and C infections\n\n* Information on interferon-gamma release assays for the detection of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection\n\n* Updated information on interactions between antiretroviral drugs and drugs used to treat opportunistic infections\n\n* A new section on malaria and other tropical diseases that may become opportunistic infections in HIV-infected immigrants to the United States and in HIV-infected American travelers\n\nHIV-associated opportunistic infections in the United States often occur in people who are unaware that they have HIV; in such cases, the opportunistic infection may be the first sign of late-stage HIV disease. HIV-associated opportunistic infections also tend to occur among Americans who are aware of their HIV infection but are not receiving treatment for it, who do not or cannot take antiretroviral therapy, who take antiretroviral therapy but fail to benefit from it, or who do not receive needed preventive care for an opportunistic infection.\n\nA draft of the new guidelines was released in June 2008 for public comment, and an early edition of the new guidelines was published online on March 24. The finalized new Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents are accessible at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5804.pdf and http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5804a1.htm. These guidelines, as well as all federal HIV prevention and treatment guidelines, can be found on the AIDSInfo Web site at http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/Guidelines/Default.aspx?MenuItem=Guidelines.\n\nA final draft of the corresponding pediatric version of these guidelines, Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections among HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children," is under review and will be published later this year.

He spends his time as a thoroughbred racehorse breeder,  and is the author of “Point of Aim Point of Impact,” which recounts his  two tours in Vietnam, and the battle he endured following his return  home.\n\n“It’s more retirement age, when your mind is not busy anymore, when some  of that stuff can come back and impact you,” Taylor said.\n\nAlthough Taylor has been able to get treatment for PTSD, thousands of  other veterans have been rejected. Until recently, in order to get PTSD  treatment, veterans needed to have documented proof of their  “stressors”—incidents, which would make them eligible.\n\nThe policy was only changed just this week.\n\nDuring his July 10 weekly address, President Barack Obama announced that  the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will no longer require a  confirmed stressor in order for veterans to be diagnosed with PTSD.\n\nThe decision will now be on VA psychiatrists and psychologists, who will  determine if a veteran’s experience supports a PTSD diagnosis, and  whether the veteran’s symptoms result from the incidents.\n\nObama said that the practice of requiring veterans to give evidence of  the incident which caused their PTSD “... has kept the vast majority of  those with PTSD who served in noncombat roles, but who still waged war,  from getting the care they need.”\n\nTaylor agrees, and shared his belief that the new policy is “going to be  a benefit to a lot of veterans who have had difficulty getting help  with PTSD.”\n\nRoadblocks to Treatment\n\nFor some occupations, stressors were a given. As a scout sniper, “I have  plenty of documentation of stressors,” said Taylor.\n\nHe added that others—such as gunners on choppers—also had an easy time  proving their stressors. While leaving a hot landing zone, and firing at  the enemy, “They’d see their machine guns cut them down, and then they  see the wounded and the maimed getting on the choppers,” said Taylor.\n\nFor others, it hasn’t been so easy. Military doctors and nurses are  among those who have traditionally had trouble getting treatment.\n\nTaylor said he knew a man in the Navy who was on a helicopter near a  ship during Vietnam. The helicopter malfunctioned and crashed into the  ocean. He was the only survivor, and was never eligible for PTSD  treatment since he was not in a combat zone.\n\nEven for those who saw combat, being diagnosed wasn’t always easy. The  need to provide evidence of a stressor is sometimes a block even for  veterans who were in combat.\n\n“Those details may be forever burned into our minds, but we often don’t  come away with hard copy proof of what occurred,” said Tammy Duckworth,  assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs at the  Department of Veterans Affairs, in a July 12 post on the White House  blog.\n\n“The previous arrangement is neither fair, nor sustainable,” Duckworth  said. “This is especially true in the current wars in Iraq and  Afghanistan where there are no static front lines and the combat zone is  everywhere.”\n\nEven with the new standards in place, however, Taylor shared that  veterans may still face problems getting treatment—not from any  government body, but rather from themselves.\n\n“One thing that I think everybody needs to understand—families,  relatives, and the returning veterans—is you cannot go through something  like that and not be affected by it,” said Taylor. “That’s normal, and  they tend to think that after they come back, that there’s something  wrong with them if they’re affected by it.”\n\n“What we’re really afraid of is how we will be judged if we do talk  about it,” said Taylor.\n\nJoshua Philipp is an award-winning investigative reporter with The Epoch Times and host of EpochTV's Crossroads program.

De Blasio spoke at one of the protests, facing a crowd not practicing the social distancing guidelines and not wearing a mask himself.\n\n“I think the problem starts out when government officials make rules, and then decide to make an exception to their own rules and join in on this exception,” Yossi Gestetner, co-founder of the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council, told The Epoch Times.\n\n“If you set policy and then you make an exception to the rules, on your own choice, you’re a dictator. And that’s not how freedom and liberties work in the United States.”\n\nGestetner noted that African Americans are statistically more vulnerable to adverse outcomes from the CCP virus. Yet the city’s leaders allowed a mass protest without the familiar reminders about social distancing and wearing masks.\n\n“Why are you subjecting a minority community to an outbreak in the name of helping the same community? It’s diabolical,” Gestetner said.\n\nRabbi Joseph Potasnik, executive vice president of the New York Board of Rabbis, told The Epoch Times that his organization is actively consulting with several prominent epidemiologists about the precautions needed to reopen houses of worship. The scientists the board spoke to all concur that New York’s limitations on congregations are reasonable and necessary.\n\n“You don’t have any disagreement amongst the health professionals, that we shouldn’t be lenient when it comes to opening these houses of worship,” Posatnik said. “I understand the stringency," I just don’t understand why we’re not enforcing that kind of standard on protesters.”	P	2024-02-11 20:10:34	2024-02-11 20:25:09",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You tend to use several variations of your child’s name; some are meaningful, while others are simply adorable sounds. Here are a few nicknames you can begin with for the name Mirha.\n\nWestern astrology includes the construction of a horoscope based on the person’s exact time of birth and location to understand the positions of the planet, stars, and zodiac signs at that time.  However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date. There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.\n\nTo know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below. This will give you a glimpse into the world of astrology tailored for your baby.\n\nVedic astrology, also called Jyotisha, provides deep insights into a person’s life based on celestial positions at birth. Rashi and nakshatra, which are an integral part of Jyotisha, are believed to influence an individual’s personality and life events. The following sections give you rashi-related information, such as the associated letters, elements, ruling body, quality, and nakshatra for the name Mirha. These details help analyze a person’s characteristics, personality, and behavior. As shown in the following table, each rashi is associated with specific sounds, which are often used as the starting letters of names for newborns in Hindu families. Each rashi is represented by a figure and one of the five elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether (Space). One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth. There are 27 nakshatras, each with its own unique qualities, attributes, and symbolism. Each rashi contains two-and-one-fourth nakshatras in it. For example, Aries contains Ashwini, Bharani, and Krithika nakshatras.\tThe below table provides information on the nakshatras’ degrees on the zodiac circle, their lords and related syllables, for babies born in the Simha (Leo) rashi. These syllables/phonetics are popularly used to choose the baby name.

He has a home in both locations.\n\nThe Vikings almost immediately decided to deactivate him for Sunday’s game against the New England Patriots, and NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said on Saturday that Peterson’s case “will be reviewed under the NFL’s personal conduct policy.”\n\nThe situation comes as the NFL proceeds with a self-commissioned investigation by a former FBI director into how it handled the case of Ray Rice, who knocked his then-fiancee unconscious in an Atlantic City elevator. Rice was released Monday from the Baltimore Ravens after a video surfaced that showed the violence. The NFL said it hadn’t seen the video before then, but a law enforcement source told the AP it was sent to a league executive’s office in April and provided a voice mail confirming it was received.\n\nUnlike Rice’s situation, Peterson’s case is complicated by his stance that he meant his son no harm but rather was applying the same discipline he experienced growing up.\n\n“Adrian is a loving father who used his judgment as a parent to discipline his son. He used the same kind of discipline with his child that he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas,” Peterson’s attorney, Rusty Hardin, said.\n\nSteve Eudey, who coached Peterson as a young boy in Palestine, Texas, and has remained a family friend, said he has heard stories from Peterson about his father Nelson “being a firm disciplinarian.”\n\n“Some of the things his dad did to him was to make him tough,” Eudey told The Associated Press.\n\nEudey said he had yet to speak to Peterson since his arrest, but said his actions were consistent with the type of upbringing he had.\n\n“I will go to my grave defending Adrian, but at the same time you can’t harm a child, either,” Eudey said. “I know that was never his intent.”\n\nGrant, the Texas prosecutor, said the grand jury felt the charge was warranted after spending several weeks reviewing “lots of evidence.”\n\nIt’s not unusual for people subjected to physical discipline as children to use corporal punishment against their own children, experts say, and courts will sometimes consider that as a mitigating factor when sentencing an abuser. Peterson faces up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine if found guilty.\n\nNews of Peterson’s charges led several prominent athletes to tweet about their experiences with corporal punishment when they were children.\n\n“Am I the only one that got hit with a switch? I had to go outside and pick my own switch. It taught values, respect (and) accountability,” former NBA star Tracy McGrady said. But he later qualified those remarks, tweeting, “Disciplining a child is vital. Of course any early physical punishment should be within reason, not overboard, and inside certain boundaries.”\n\nWhile the legal process plays out, the NFL is facing a potential test case for the tougher penalties it declared last month for players involved with domestic violence.\n\nCommissioner Roger Goodell announced an initial offense will draw a six-week suspension without pay, though “more severe discipline will be imposed if there are aggravating circumstances such as the presence or use of a weapon, choking, repeated striking, or when the act is committed against a pregnant woman or in the presence of a child.”\n\nIt is not clear if Peterson’s case will invoke those penalties.\n\nCorporal punishment is legal in Texas, and the law spells out that non-deadly force against a child by a parent or guardian is permissible.\n\nBut the punishment is abusive if it causes injury. While a blow that causes a red mark that fades in an hour is not likely to be judged abusive, a blow that leaves a bruise, welt, or swelling, or requires medical attention, could be judged abusive. The child’s injuries will likely be under scrutiny as the case proceeds.\n\nThe guidelines also say while spanking with the bare, open hand is least likely to be abusive, use of an instrument “is cause for concern.”\n\nThe Vikings jumped ahead of the NFL and the legal system by shelving Peterson for the game Sunday. Two other teams — Carolina and San Francisco — have taken heat for allowing players involved in alleged recent domestic violence incidents to continue to play.\n\nThe team — and the league — will likely face scrutiny as they decide whether Peterson returns to the field as the legal process plays out. As of Saturday, no decision had been made about his outlook this season," and no court date had been set in Texas.

Not all, unfortunately, but most are, Kumar said. Drawing any conclusion from the earlier data would be premature ... but we are hopeful at this time.\n\nWhen Olson developed a fever in mid- to late-March, it was the beginning of a coronavirus saga that would last for weeks.\n\nShe said the fever itself lasted 8 days, and she spent a couple of weeks mostly in bed. But even after her other symptoms had ebbed, Olson felt a deep fatigue for a total of more than a month.\n\nStairs would kill me, Olson said. Doing a load of laundry would send me back to bed for the rest of the day.\n\nBut as she slowly recovered at home, Olson was developing a super power.\n\nOn April 19, she went to the American Red Cross in Farmington to donate blood plasma. She was hooked up to an apheresis machine, which took blood through a needle in one of her arms, pumped it through a machine to separate and remove the plasma and then pumped the remaining blood components back into her other arm.\n\nThe process took about an hour and a half, Olson said, and it left her a bit woozy and lightheaded.\n\nOther plasma donors say they have been affected by the donation process.\n\nChris Madison, a 29-year-old programmer at Hartford Hospital, said he didn't feel any weakness after an hour-long apherisis session at the American Red Cross in Westerly.\n\nAfter recovering from a relatively mild case of COVID-19, Madison said he was happy that he could help out in some way, particularly because many of his family members are front-line health care workers.\n\nI've been kind of sidelined a little bit, being more of a programmer and having COVID and being quarantined, Madison said. So I was just kind of looking for any way I could give back and kind of help with the crisis.\n\nThe plasma donation process can be lengthy—recovered patients have to go through all of the paperwork and blood type testing of a normal blood donation, and then they also have to test negative for COVID-19.\n\nAfter recovering from the coronaviurs, President of Bristol Health Kurt Barwis is currently waiting for his post-recovery test result so that he can donate plasma to Trinity Health's clinical trial. Even before his first plasma donation, he's already decided that he'll donate plasma a second time.\n\nBarwis said he's heard that convalescent plasma can help severely ill patients, which made donating a no-brainer.\n\nWe're still trying to figure out how to deal with this horrible disease, Barwis said. So why wouldn't we try to use the things that are working?\n\nSome recovered hospital workers have hit roadblocks in the donation process.\n\nAndrew Kemerly, a first-year surgery resident at UConn Health, tested positive for COVID-19 in mid-March. Right off the bat, he asked to be notified if he could donate plasma.\n\nWhen I first tested, I told them, Please tell me if we get plasma donations set up,' Kemerly said.\n\nBut despite being symptom-free for weeks, Kemerly's first post-recovery COVID-19 test came back inconclusive. His second post-recovery test came back positive. He's now waiting to once again get retested before donating plasma.\n\nAnother UConn Health employee had a similar experience. Amy Chmielewski, who oversees the clinical curriculum for medical students, had been symptom-free for two weeks when she was retested. Her test still came back positive.\n\nChmielewski was then retested again, and this time it came back negative. She's hoping to be able to donate plasma soon. When the hospital reached out and asked if she wanted to donate, Chmielewski said, she didn't even think of saying no.\n\nHer moderate case of COVID-19 gave her a sense of the fear that the virus can bring—and she knows that the fear is magnified for patients who are severely ill.\n\nPlasma is all we have at this point," Chmielewski said. I was grateful for the opportunity to help.

S. citizens.\n\nIn recent decades,,,, which houses the Census Bureau, announced the inclusion of a citizenship question in the upcoming census last year. One of the reasons given for adding the question, which until the 1950s was a staple of the census, was to help identify possible violations of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nMore recently, the question has been included in the smaller, more detailed study, the Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey, which is sent to about 3.5 million households annually.\n\nBut last year, Democratic politicians vehemently denounced putting the question in the census, accusing the Trump administration of having sinister ulterior motives.\n\nChair of the Democratic National Committee Tom Perez said the move was “a craven attack on our democracy and a transparent attempt to intimidate immigrant communities.” The census is not supposed to be “a political tool for Donald Trump to push his agenda and disempower Latinos and other people of color.”\n\nPerez said restoring the citizenship question stokes “fear” that makes immigrant communities “invisible.” In reality, they are “guaranteeing an inaccurate count that lays the groundwork for sustained racial gerrymandering and jeopardizes critical resources for communities across the country.”\n\nTimothy Olson, associate director for field operations at the U. S. Census Bureau, said he hopes the legal dispute is resolved soon because his agency faces a “hard deadline in June” for finalizing the questions that will be printed on the questionnaires.\n\n“My job, and all of my peers’ job, is to make sure the census is as accurate as possible. We’re just waiting for a final decision to go to print. If the decision is delayed, that presents new challenges for us. We’re hopeful that firm direction will be provided, so we know which version to print.”\n\nOlson said more than $675 billion in federal funding is at stake. That money is allocated to states, counties, cities, and Indian tribes each year," according to census findings.

Not only are they facing their second straight elimination game,,,, Bibby, and Jeremy Lin had passed him on the depth chart.\n\nPros: Douglas is quicker and a better defensive player than the slower Bibby. If healthy he should be well-rested since he hasn’t seen the court since April 20.\n\nCons: Douglas is not a great offensive player. He hit just 32.4 percent of his field goal attempts on the season, and that includes playing meaningful minutes in December and January. Also his prolonged absence from the court might mean he’s fresh, but there should be plenty of rust as well.\n\n2. Rush Jeremy Lin back into action. Lin has been out since March 24 and is recovering from knee surgery.\n\nPros: When healthy he’s the best point guard on the roster after his breakout season this year. His play-making skills especially would come in handy in a series where the Knicks offense has often looked stale. In addition, the energy he brings to the court would nice change of pace for Mike Woodson’s club.\n\nCons: There is a school of thought that says anytime you bring a player from a prolonged absence back into a team’s regular rotation—no matter how good they are—it requires an adjustment period before the team gels together again. Lin, who has missed 21 of the 28 games that Mike Woodson has been coach would definitely require an adjustment period. In addition, with the team just one loss away from a first-round playoff exit, it may not be wise to test his surgically repaired knee at this time. If they were in the finals, that would be another thing.\n\n3. Put Carmelo Anthony at the point.\n\nPros: Woodson already wants the ball in Anthony’s hands as the offense goes through him anyway. Plus his height (6‘8“) at the position would create matchup problems for the Heat defensively. The Knicks could put him alongside J. R. Smith (6’6”) or Landry Fields (6‘7“) at shooting guard with Steve Novak (6’10”) and Amar‘e Stoudemire (6’10“) at the forward positions and Tyson Chandler (7'1”) at center. The lack of quickness would be mitigated by their rebounding advantage and the likelihood to be able find a favorable post-up opportunity at nearly every individual matchup on the floor.\n\nCons: Having Carmelo at the point is not a lineup the Knicks have put on the floor this season and might require a little adjustment for the team to get used to. The Heat would also have an opportunity to speed up the pace of the game with a smaller lineup.\n\nWhat will happen: Bibby will go for about 35 minutes, Douglas will give him a 5-minute breather, and Mike Woodson will try Carmelo (and maybe even J.R. Smith) at the point the rest of the time," while Lin continues to rehab.\n\nThe Epoch Times publishes in 35 countries and in 19 languages. Subscribe to our e-newsletter.

235f5b5ad9c04ce257d4cee956405aac,https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/beefing-up-traceability-measures-would-help-curb-food-fraud-expert-says-2241741,food fraud|Canada|food fraud conference|food items,Talc|Garlic|Garlic Powder|add|eye|test,food fraud,“An important measure is beefing up traceability measures. Food ingredients are sourced from all over the planet but that doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be the right traceability to prevent food fraud from occurring.”\n\nGodefroy,,,, was added to milk powder. The powder caused the deaths of four children.\n\n“A good fraudster is someone who technically hides very well his game,” said Samuel Godefroy, a leading expert in food risk analysis at Laval University. “We’re not supposed to discover the issue, but when it turns badly and when the fraud is done by people that have no scruples in what they are doing, it can even lead to tragic consequences.”\n\nRecent estimates put the cost of food fraud at around US$40 billion worldwide, according to research from Michigan State University. It includes everything from mislabelling the country of origin or using “organic” labels when the item is not organic, to changing expiry dates, counterfeiting products, and adulterating or substituting ingredients.\n\nFrom wood pulp found in grated Parmesan cheese, to garlic powder spiked with talc, to the recent massive case of adulterated or spoiled meat products from leading exporter Brazil, food fraud is a widespread problem and is garnering attention among consumers whose health could be put at risk.\n\nGodefroy said the conference was a great opportunity for academics, government regulators, and industry to get together to increase focus on preventative measures.\n\nInstead of reactive measures such as fines for fraudsters, he said there needs to be more resources for random checks of food samples to test food items such as olive oil, honey, and maple syrup, which have all been found to be adulterated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).\n\nThey are among the 70 cases of food suppliers’ non-compliance with labelling laws on average per year in the last five years in Canada, which the agency publishes on its website.  That number is low, however, compared to how widespread food fraud is.\n\nSeafood substitution and mislabelling is common in many countries, including Canada and the United States. In Canada, a CBC Marketplace study found that 34 of 153 fish samples from grocery stores were mislabelled. Seafood substitution occurs when a lower-priced fish is labelled as a higher priced fish in order to sell the lower-priced fish for more.\n\nLeading food fraud experts and regulators are turning to new technologies to also combat food fraud. Blockchain technology is being applied to improve traceability and avoid counterfeiting food items. In Canada, Walmart and Loblaws are already putting such technology to use.\n\nAccording to the CFIA, Canada is the world leader in DNA barcoding technology, which can be used to identify food fraud by testing exactly the makeup of the food item on a molecular level, whether it is organic, and its geographical origin.\n\nCurrently the DNA analysis technology is slow and costly, but according to Sylvain Charlebois, a leading researcher of food fraud at Dalhousie University, in the future Canadians could have access to affordable hand-held DNA analysis devices the size of smartphones to detect food fraud in the supermarket or at home.\n\n“I think essentially you’re dealing with the future of food.” Charlebois said. “If you don’t have trust from the consumers, it becomes very difficult to add any value and grow the food business.”\n\nCharlebois noted the University of Guelph is teaming up with the CFIA to work on making the DNA analysis technology more simple and cost-effective and eventually accessible to the public.\n\nAnd this is important, he added, considering 63 percent of Canadians are worried the foods they’re buying are not what the labels are claiming, especially those with health conditions, according to an online survey conducted by a research team he led at Dalhousie.\n\nCharlebois said that in developed countries like Canada, the food fraud that took place in Brazil—the largest exporter of meat products in the world—is less likely to happen because of the amount of corruption involved with Brazilian government regulators. He called it “one of the worst food fraud scandals in modern times.”\n\nIn the scandal, cheaper animal parts were substituted for more expensive ingredients or products, with suspicious odours disguised by using acid. In addition, it is alleged that health inspectors allowed expired meat to be sold, turning a blind eye in exchange for bribes.\n\nBut Charlebois added that more transparency within the CFIA would be helpful to inform the public more regarding its inspection process and results.\n\nThe CFIA, which also took part in the global food fraud conference, said consumers are starting to ask more questions and become more aware of food fraud, which is an important tool in fighting it. But it’s such a widespread issue that all players, from industry to government to academia, have to work together to mitigate food fraud.\n\n“We have to remember the people conducting the fraud are interested in making money,” said Aline Dimitri," the CFIA’s deputy chief food safety officer.\n\n“But sometimes it’s in ways that we haven’t anticipated so it’s important to exchange information and make sure all the players in the system have open channels of communication in order to address this critical issue.”\n\nJared Gnam is a freelance reporter based in Vancouver.

It helps prevent functional decline,,,, European Americans and Hispanic Americans ages 59 to 96 living independently. While prior studies have addressed the question of factors influencing older adults' physical activity levels, none have employed the large range of instruments/tools used in this study or included older adults from multiple ethnic groups.\n\nResults of the study, published in the journal Geriatrics, showed that age, education, social network, pain and depression were the five factors that accounted for a statistically significant proportion of unique variance in physical activity in this diverse, community dwelling older population.\n\nParticipants who reported lower physical activity tended to be older, have less years of education and reported lower social engagement, networking, resilience, mental health, self-health rating, and higher levels of depression, anxiety, pain, and body mass index (BMI) compared to the moderate to high physical activity groups.\n\nA secondary analysis examined factors associated with calculated MET-h/week (ratio of the rate at which a person expends energy relative to the mass of that person). Findings showed the strongest correlation to MET-h/week was with depression.\n\nFour of the five significant predictors of physical activity in the older adults we studied are at least partially modifiable. For example, social network, depression and pain can be ameliorated by physical activity, said Ruth M. Tappen, Ed. D., RN, FAAN, senior author and the Christine E. Lynn Eminent Scholar and professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing.\n\nResearchers found that pain was associated with less time spent being physically active. What is not clear is whether older adults understand that sedentary lifestyles can promote and/or worsen some types of pain and physical activity can help to reduce pain or whether this knowledge alone is enough to motivate them to become more active.\n\nEducation may be key both in helping older adults with depressive symptoms understand that physical activity can help reduce their symptoms and in helping them to identify the types of activity that they may find enjoyable, said Tappen.\n\nStudy findings suggest that many of these factors could be addressed by designing and testing individual, group and community level interventions to increase physical activity in the older population. Researchers recommend education on the effect of activity on common sources of pain such as arthritis or back pain and encouraging health care providers to write a prescription for a daily walk or a workout for those with depression.\n\nIn addition, community outreach to isolated older adults, improving the walkability of neighborhoods, repairing sidewalks, adding trails and making these areas safe to walk and work out are other interventions to help increase physical activity in the older population.\n\nPartnerships among local senior centers, low income housing developments, places of worship, YMCAs and health care providers are crucial in developing tailored multi-faceted programs for physically inactive older adults, especially those experiencing pain and/or depression, said Tappen.\n\nThese programs can provide health-related education pertinent to the identified medical issues such as pain and depression and assist participants in meeting other participants and in developing specific physical activity-related goals, which are known to be associated with sustained involvement.\n\nSociodemographic variables included age, sex, years of education, ethnic group membership, years living in the United States, and receipt of Medicaid based upon income level qualifications. Cognition was measured using the Mini-Mental State Exam. Psychosocial variables included social engagement, social network, resilience, personality, anxiety, depression, spirituality and the SF-36 mental health summary score.\n\nPhysical measures included pain, BMI, body consciousness," functional ability and self-rating of health. Behavioral variables included adherence to prescribed medications and self-reported physical activity levels.

It’s a phrase always used but ... it takes on life when you see these men.”\n\nAddressing the three living soldiers and relatives of Kaneshiro, who is deceased, the president said, “I’m proud to finally award our highest military recognition, the Medal of Honor, to each of you.”\n\nBiden noted that more than 50 years had passed “since the jungles of Vietnam where, as young men, these soldiers first proved their mettle. But time has not diminished their astonishing bravery, their selflessness in putting the lives of others ahead of their own, and the gratitude that we as a nation owe them.”\n\nKaneshiro, killed in action by hostile gunfire in Vietnam in 1967, received his honor posthumously for a Dec. 1,1966, raid where his unit came under fire by North Vietnamese troops. His actions were credited with helping his unit withdraw from the village where they were fighting. Kaneshiro was born and raised in Hawaii, a son of Japanese immigrants.\n\nBirdwell was honored for actions helping to head off an assault and evacuate wounded at Tan Son Nhut Airbase near Saigon on Jan. 31,1968, despite injuries to his torso and face, during an opening salvo in what is known as the Tet Offensive, an especially bloody period of the war.\n\nBirdwell, a member of the Cherokee Nation and a lawyer in Oklahoma City, had received a Silver Star for his actions. Biden said it took Birdwell’s commanding officer decades to realize that Birdwell had not received the proper recognition and took steps, even in retirement, to “make this day possible.”\n\n“At long last, long last, your story is being honored as it should have been always,” Biden told Birdwell.\n\nFujii received a Medal of Honor for actions over four days in February 1971 treating wounded and directing air strikes against enemy positions after his air ambulance was forced to crash land.\n\nDuffy was recognized for leading troops who came under ambush after their commander was killed in action, repelling attackers and evacuating wounded, despite his own injuries. Duffy went on to become an author and once was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for poetry.\n\n“He is the definition of a warrior poet,"” Biden said.

Falun Gong spokesperson Mr. Erping Zhang was interviewed and answered several questions about the announcement.\n\nReporter: The Falun Dafa Association recently published an important announcement. Could you please tell our readers what its main contents are,,,, suffered break-ups within the family, and were even forced to become homeless to avoid harassment, merely because they practiced Falun Gong. Jiang Zemin and his followers, who used the government's media monopoly and propaganda organs both in China and abroad in order to eliminate Falun Gong physically as well as to defame the reputation of the practice, instigated this shocking genocide. Such a persecution is unprecedented in terms of its size and cruelty. Facing such persecution, Falun Gong practitioners have held firmly to Falun Gong's core principles of “Truth, Compassion and Forbearance,” and they have clarified the truth peacefully all over the world; these benevolent and steadfast acts have won sympathy and support from many people both inside China and elsewhere.\n\nConcurrently, Falun Gong practitioners have successfully and effectively filed civil and criminal lawsuits against many of the key figures involved in the persecution, with the result that Jiang Zemin and other perpetrators are facing court cases in many countries. “Good deeds will result in good consequences and bad deeds will receive retribution” is truly the guiding rule of the world. So at this critical moment when the CCP is collapsing, the Falun Dafa Association has provided the CCP and its officials with one more chance, hoping that they will immediately stop the persecution of Falun Gong. If they have committed crimes against Falun Gong and now want to make amends, they can submit a letter of repentance, and/or a guarantee statement that they will no longer persist in their misdeeds, to Minghui Net (English version is Clearwisdom.net) or to any regional Falun Dafa Association to be archived. We will not investigate the various crimes of those who are determined to correct their mistakes, but we will continue to monitor their actions. As a matter of fact, there are many people of conscience in all levels of the Chinese government who are against this persecution, and they have been resisting the maltreatment of Falun Gong in different ways.\n\nReporter: Last year's publication of “Nine Commentaries on the Chinese Communist Party” by The Epoch Times started the trend of withdrawing from the CCP and its related organizations. There are currently over 5 million people who have resigned from the Party. Would you like to comment on this?\n\nMr. Zhang: The “Nine Commentaries” exposed the CCP's vile nature and bloody history. The voluntary withdrawal of so many people, even while the CCP is still in power, is unprecedented in the history of the Communist movement. This indicates that the CCP has lost the loyalty of the Chinese people and it is only a matter of time until the CCP collapses.\n\nFalun Gong has upheld its principle of not getting involved in politics and we use peaceful means that rely on “Truth, Compassion and Forbearance” to oppose the persecution. The Falun Gong teachings and exercises provide a way of cultivation, helping people to improve both spiritually and physically, and to return to their true selves, which are kind and considerate. Falun Gong could bring goodness to the people of any country, anywhere.\n\nReporter: News reports have stated that since Falun Gong sued many high-level officials of the CCP, others who have committed crimes in the persecution are afraid to travel abroad. Would you please tell us more about this and also about your future plans?\n\nMr. Zhang: It is true that several of those who committed wrongdoings in the persecution received monetary and political incentives to participate and also planned to move abroad at the earliest opportunity. However, such wrongdoings will not be considered legal by international law and will be tried and judged accordingly in the law courts of various countries. Furthermore, after the CCP collapses in the near future, the Chinese people will bring the officials who persecuted their own people to trial. There is an international organization that specializes in investigating the leaders and others who persecute Falun Gong. The lawsuits against the Minister of Information Industry, Wang Xudong, Minister of Commerce, Bo Xilai, former CCP Beijing City Secretary, Jia Qinglin, CCP Anhui Province Secretary, Wang Tuihua, Dalian Mayor, Xia Deren, CCP Beijing City Secretary, Liu Qi, and Guandong Province Governor, Huang Huahua, all indicated our determination to investigate and pursue any and all criminals involved in the persecution of Falun Gong, until the day justice is achieved.\n\nReporter: It was recently reported that a scramble for power inside the CCP has been escalating; Jiang's followers, Zeng Qinghong and Luo Gan, intensified the persecution of Falun Gong in order to force Hu Jintao to be complicit in such an illegal act. Can you comment on this?\n\nMr. Zhang: Most of the people in China under the CCP's control are against the persecution; so the party is facing a critical impasse. We observed that in the past two years under the leadership of Hu and Wen, Zeng Qinghong and Luo Gan did not stop the persecution," but rather intensified it behind the scenes. Their goal was to drag Hu and Wen into participating in the persecution. We believe that morality in China is deteriorating and that the CCP faces collapse and will have no future. We hope that Hu and Wen make good use of the limited time remaining to stop the persecution for the good of the nation. The final judgment of Jiang's regime and his followers is just around the corner.\n\nCopyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc. All Rights Reserved.

It compared two groups—people who were exposed to lockdowns during 2020 and those who were relatively free of restrictions.\n\nUniversity of Melbourne Professor Mark Wooden, co-author of the article said the study showed lockdowns can exaggerate existing inequalities in the responsibility for household and caring duties.\n\nIf lockdowns and other policies intended to restrict population movement are to remain part of the policy toolkit for responding to pandemics, more attention needs to be given to providing support to alleviate the potential negative side-effects, including for example, focusing on equitably delivering childcare services and schooling, Professor Wooden said.\n\nFurther research is also needed into the potential modifying role that environmental factors, such as housing and access to outdoor space, might have on the psychological effects of lockdowns.\n\nMental health was assessed in this report using the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5), assessing overall mood and frequency of anxiety symptoms over four weeks. Scores ranged from 0 to 100, with low values indicative of poor mental health.\n\nThe analysis showed that while, on average, the effect of the Victorian 2020 lockdown on mental health overall was very small (from 71.6 in 2019 to 69.4 in 2020) and on par with other states (from 72.0 in 2019 to 70.9 in 2020), coupled women with children experienced a 4.4 point decline during lockdown, compared with only 1.2 point decline for coupled men with dependent children.\n\n* No negative effect of lockdown was found for single mothers\n\n* No evidence that lockdown effect was different for males in couples with or without dependent children\n\n* Effects of lockdown on mental health were not driven by the most vulnerable populations (older adults living on their own, those with chronic physical or mental health conditions or those in the most disadvantaged socioeconomic circumstances)\n\n* Mental health effects were greater among those with higher income\n\n* No evidence of a lockdown effect on the mental health of adolescents aged 15 to 19 years (important to note that HILDA has previously shown a significant decline in the mental health of adolescents, but this study shows the decline is not attributable to lockdowns\n\nWhile this study doesn't speak to the prolonged effects of lockdowns, nor what the impact would be in the absence of lockdowns in relation to greater illness and death caused by COVID-19, it does provide evidence of mental health effects that should be accounted for when evaluating the merits and costs of the Australian COVID-19 policy approach, Professor Wooden said.\n\nIt's also important to note that although our findings are very specific to the Australian context, these policy responses (stay-at-home orders, school and business closures, cancelation of public events, and restrictions on movement) and their mental health effects might be widespread around the world.\n\nIn its 20th year," this is the first release of HILDA data taken from during the COVID-19 pandemic. The full release is expected later in 2022.

I stopped eating because I could never find the 'right' food. I didn't want to leave the house in case I saw something I didn't like to see, and those things ranged from anything from crying children to dirty light switches.\n\nMcQueen says she has become suicidal in the past and turned to alcohol. I was hungry, thirsty but unable to sort out those things because the OCD told me that the food would turn to dirt in my mouth, that the water was rancid and that if I left my room to go to the bathroom, I would never be able to get back in again, she says.\n\nOCD also caused her to pick at her skin. I search for marks, spots, hairs, anything that I can remove, and cause a lot of damage to my skin, she says. Sara is now taking medication and having therapy.\n\nCraig Shirley, a therapist and co-founder of the OCD Treatment Centre, says OCD often means experiencing severe anxiety around the things that we care about.\n\nThis often leads the person to become afraid of their thoughts, or environmental triggers that make them feel anxious. They then perform behaviours known as rituals to control their anxious symptoms, which in turn only serves to give more meaning and importance to the thoughts, he adds.\n\nThe person then gets more intrusive thoughts and increasingly feels the need to switch these feelings off more often, which eventually can become a debilitating cycle of thoughts, feelings and behaviours.\n\nUnlike those who don’t suffer from OCD - who have thoughts they can ignore - someone with the condition will focus on the thought and begin to perform rituals to ensure the thought doesn’t come true, Shirley explains.\n\nOCD goes far beyond the common perception of handwashing - and it can be extremely debilitating and disrupt all aspects of someone's life, from work to friendships and relationships. Simple tasks such as eating, cooking, washing or taking the rubbish out can become impossible.\n\nAlso, OCD can leave people feeling depressed as well as having low self-esteem, in which case these can also be factors for a person struggling to have a normal lifestyle, Shirley says.\n\nDespite the severity of OCD, the term is commonly misused to describe people who like cleanliness or organisation - which underestimates the affect the condition can have on people with it.\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions regarding OCD is that some people can be a 'little bit OCD', Shirley says. Although we may occasionally have intrusive thoughts, have feelings of anxiety or be superstitious, it is not the same as having the condition.\n\nCarrie Wheeler,40, has OCD as well as other mental health conditions and multiple sclerosis. She says another misconception is that people with OCD are only obsessive regarding cleaning, but the condition can actually manifest in many different ways.\n\nI think the biggest misconception I know of is that all people with OCD are clean freaks. We do not all furiously clean our house or have an extreme fear of germs and wash our hands continuously, she says.\n\nFor Wheeler, OCD affects her home life and the way she eats, as her food must be prepared in a certain order. If I lose something, I spend hours looking for it, staying awake until I find whatever it is - often keeping my husband awake while looking around in my bedroom for what it is, she says.\n\nWhether someone develops OCD depends on a number of factors, including personality, genetics or life events. Although it is a long term (chronic) and debilitating condition, many people overcome OCD with treatment and support - or are able to reduce the impact it has on their lives.\n\nThere are many ways that a person can get treatment for OCD, Shirley says. The most common would be to visit your GP in order to explain your symptoms, before being referred to a specialist service such as a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) therapist.\n\nWith talking therapy, such as CBT, a person with OCD can learn to manage symptoms to regain an improved quality of life.\n\nShirley says CBT can be successful in the treatment of OCD, but other anxiety management tools can help alongside the therapy: Often other principles, such as mindfulness and awareness of thoughts, education around the condition and the brain’s role in it, as well as a well-constructed relapse prevention programme for the person to follow once they finish therapy.\n\nA therapy called exposure and response prevention can also be included as a part of CBT. This involves encouraging someone to face their fears and let obsessive thoughts happen without following them up with compulsions to 'fix' them.\n\nYour doctor or a specialist may recommend taking certain medication, as well as therapy.\n\nGetting advice, information and support from organisations which specialise in OCD can help you understand more about the condition and how it can be treated, such as the charity OCD-UK. They can also help prevent isolation and offer a chance to socialise with others.\n\nOther options include contacting OCD Action or Mind, two very good mental health charities who can help to put you in the right direction, says Shirley.\n\nIt also helps to seek out a therapist who has had experience of treating the condition or who has experienced it themselves," as we find that many of our clients explain that this makes a big difference and helps them to feel understood whilst recovering from the condition.

05f36f379b6ec8d495b9723749ee0c03,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-09-globe-distinct-kawasaki-disease-season.html#!,Kawasaki disease|KD cases|cases|Northern hemisphere|disease,heart|pediatrics|test,kawasaki disease,After more than four decades of research,,,, mistake for an inconsequential viral infection. In fact, if not diagnosed or treated in time, it can lead to irreversible heart damage. Decades of research have been unable to pinpoint the cause of the disease, although genetic studies show a heritable tendency to acquiring the disease.\n\nFindings of an international team of scientists - organized by Jane C. Burns, MD, professor of pediatrics and director of the Kawasaki Disease Research Center at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego – now support earlier evidence that KD cases are linked to large-scale wind currents that track from Asia to Japan and also traverse the North Pacific.\n\nThe study found that 40 percent more cases of Kawasaki disease in the Northern hemisphere occurred from January through March than from August through September – coinciding with high and low intensities of tropospheric winds. Previous studies showed that when winds blew from the northwest across Japan in a southeasterly direction, the number of KD cases there increased. At the conclusion of the epidemics, the wind had reversed direction and commenced blowing across Japan from the Pacific Ocean in a northwesterly direction. This same pattern was repeated from year to year.\n\nThe passage of these large-scale wind patterns across the Pacific was similarly associated with an increase in KD cases in San Diego, California.\n\nThis study built and expanded upon earlier research investigating a possible influence from large-scale environmental factors, (published by this scientific team in a November 2011 study in Nature Scientific Reports) by a team of researchers that also included two contributors to this study: Daniel R. Cayan, Climate Atmospheric Science and Physical Oceanography (CASPO) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, and Xavier Rodó of the Institut Català de Ciències del Clima and the Institució Catalana de Recerca (IC3) in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nOur data suggest a seasonal exposure to a KD agent that operates over large geographic regions and is concentrated during winter months in non-tropical regions of the Northern hemisphere, Burns said.\n\nDatasets were much sparser in the tropics and the Southern hemisphere, but showed a maximum incidence in May through June, with approximately 30 percent of the cases occurring in that time period; however, the pattern was not considered statistically significant.\n\nDuring winter months, there are stronger seasonal winds across the Northern hemisphere, which could lead to increased transport of the suspected KD agent, said Burns. This may explain, in part, the consistency in the seasonal nature of Kawasaki disease that we observe in our pediatric patients.\n\nWhile there is no diagnostic test, signs of KD include prolonged fever associated with rash, red eyes, mouth, lips and tongue, and swollen hands and feet with peeling skin. The disease causes damage to the coronary arteries in a quarter of untreated children and may lead to serious heart problems in early adulthood. The aneurysm rate for Kawasaki disease is 5 percent, and the death rate is 0.1 percent.\n\nWhile seasonality of the disease has been noted in many regions – particularly in Japan, the country of highest incidence for KD – the search for factors that might contribute to epidemics and fluctuations in KD occurrence has been elusive. A study of KD cases in Japan since 1970 showed three dramatic nationwide epidemics, each lasting several months and peaking in April 1979 (6,700 cases), May 1982 (16,100 cases) and March 1986 (14,700 cases). These three peaks represent the largest KD epidemic events ever recorded in the world.\n\nPrevious epidemiological investigations suggest that the causative agent for KD is widely distributed in the environment, that there is no person-to-person transmission and that genetic susceptibility plays a part in at least some of the disease variation across different ethnic and racial groups. Japan continues to be the country of highest incidence," but seasonality of the disease has been documented in Hawaii and San Diego as well.\n\nThe scientists report that this recent comprehensive analysis to detect seasonal cycles of KD cases from around the world could be significant in efforts to isolate the cause of this devastating childhood disease.

Morgan, M. D., associate director of Mechanical Circulatory Support in the Edith and Benson Ford Heart and Vascular Institute at Henry Ford.\n\nHowever, there is insufficient data and a lack of recommendations regarding the necessity and safety of stopping anticoagulation medication for surgery. The focus of this study was to review our four-year experience with the management of non-cardiac surgery patients on LVAD.\n\nDuring the study period that the authors reviewed, from March 2006 through May 2010, 64 patients with chronic heart failure underwent implantation of an LVAD at Henry Ford.\n\nClinical records of the patients were reviewed to identify patients who underwent non-cardiac surgical procedures while on LVAD support, with a focus on pre- and post-operative management of their blood-thinning medication. Researchers were also looking for any complications relating to bleeding, blood clots, or device malfunction.\n\nTwenty non-cardiac surgeries were performed on 15 patients while on LVAD support. At the time of surgery, the patients had been on LVAD support for seven to ten months. Eighty-five percent of patients who were waiting for heart transplants, and sixty percent of terminally ill patients, were kept on preoperative aspirin and Coumadin for the surgical procedures.\n\nThe surgeries included procedures for cataracts, bowel resection, gall bladder removal, peripheral (leg) artery bypasses, hernias, and dental work.\n\nIn five of the eight surgeries for which patients stopped using Coumadin before surgery, Heparin was substituted.\n\nGeneral anesthesia was well tolerated by all patients. There were no deaths, nor complications due to blood clots or device malfunctions. Bleeding occurred in 35 percent of procedures. The average length of hospital stay after surgery was four to ten days.\n\nOur research team concluded that, as these clinical scenarios are becoming more common, development of institutional guidelines and possibly international protocols for the management of LVAD patients having non-cardiac surgery may be prudent, says Dr. Morgan.\n\nRobert J. Brewer, M. D., surgical director of Mechanical Circulatory Support at Henry Ford and co-author of the study, noted that it may possible to reduce the incidence of bleeding after surgery by lowering the preoperative use of blood thinning medications," although more analysis is required to determine if this can be performed safely without increasing the incidence of blood clots.\n\nDr. Morgan will present the study on April 15 at the annual meeting of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation in San Diego.

The two leaders also agreed to expand opportunities for higher military education in India for Afghan officers.\n\nA report by Press Trust of India (PTI) highlights that Karzai asked India for stepping up military aid, including lethal and non-lethal weapons. There are indications that the Indian government is not averse to Karzai’s demands. Officials of Indian External affairs Ministry said the demands are being considered as they need to consider many factors like surpluses and licensing from other countries.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts are of the view that this cooperation is to address India’s own security concerns. Manoj Rai, the director of the Society for Participatory Research in Asia said, “There seems to great uncertainty around post-2014 Afghanistan scenario after withdrawal of NATO forces in 2014.”\n\n“The delay in the signing of the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) between the U. S. and Afghanistan, coupled with Obama’s zero-option dictate has further deepened suspense on the future of Afghanistan’s security, democracy, and development. Whatever it may be, uncertainty and/or suspense, Indian policy makers and international strategists know it well that India’s own security concerns are bound to rise,” Rai said.\n\nWhile the security scenario bothers both countries, Afghanistan is also gravely concerned by the impact of the lurking instability on its economy.\n\nMirweis Azizi, an economist from Kandhar who has worked with various international NGOs in Afghanistan said, “There is already a decline in Afghan business by six positions from last year’s business ranking, and the situation is likely to worsen after NATO withdraws and instability increases.” He said that the Afghan common man wants that India must support Afghanistan in trade and creating employment in the country.\n\nAzizi, who is a part of the local youth movement called “Afghanistan Forward,” said that according to the World Bank’s 2012 report, no concrete plans have been formulated for the economic stability of the country yet, which Afghanistan ranks at 160th out of 183 economies for the ease of doing business. “This situation is likely to worsen after the withdrawal on account of instability,” he said.\n\nSince the war-torn country is going for presidential elections next year, the concerns have become graver as Karzai has already served for two maximum terms. Azizi said there are at least six serious candidates with a chance of winning. “Whoever wins, will face the acute problem of development of the country as whole and guarding against the utilization of country’s natural resources, while simultaneously ensuring that corruption, factional conflict, and imbalance is curtailed.”\n\nRai points out that incidentally as Afghanistan moves into the presidential elections, India will be facing national general elections for a new government in New Delhi next year; but so far India’s responses to future possibilities in Afghanistan have been business as usual. However, Rai said that NATO withdrawal, fear of Afghan’s turbulent next year’s elections, and the political developments in Maldives, Bangladesh and Nepal coupled with “not so positive so far” responses from new Pakistan government can put India in a difficult situation.\n\nAccording to Rai, India should help Afghanistan in conducting free and fair elections. “Make investment in deepening democracy there specially strengthening local government there—a pact was signed between 2 governments in this regard but unfortunately not realized,” he said.\n\nWhile Azizi believes that India should build up ways for mutual trade and provide free route to Afghanis for health care. He said that Afghan people hope that the relation between Pakistan and India improve soon so Pakistan stops interference in Afghanistan internal matters and becomes less skeptic about Afghanistan-India strong brotherhood relationship.\n\nFurthermore, Aziz stressed that Afghan Youth needs the greatest support and attention, as more than 65 percent of Afghan’s population is youth, it’s future. “If tomorrow we have strong educated people in power, it will automatically give us a strong nation, and a strong nation is in the benefits of all countries in Asia and for the whole world,"” he said.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) announced on Tuesday evening a plan for the federal government to buy troubled mortgages and refinance them at lower interest rates for homeowners. Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) announced on Tuesday evening a plan for the federal government to buy troubled mortgages and refinance them at lower interest rates for homeowners.\n\nMcCain proposed the Homeownership Resurgence Plan during the presidential debate,,,, a mortgage would be refinanced down to 100 percent of the home’s current value. Homeowners will make payments based on the terms of the new mortgage contract, which is guaranteed by the U.S. government.Hope for Homeowners, a housing rescue bill passed in July, calls for mortgage lenders to write down mortgages to 90 percent of current home values. In that plan, lenders would take the loss between the current home value and its original mortgage balance.\n\nMcCain’s proposal would essentially shift the risk of loss to the U.S. government—and ultimately, taxpayers—by having the FHA buy the mortgage loans from the lenders.\n\nThe Obama Campaign responded in a statement: “John McCain wants the government to massively overpay for mortgages in a plan that would guarantee taxpayers lose money," and put them at risk of losing even more if home values don’t recover.”\n\nCopyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

Monday’s renewed trouble underscored the growing sense across the continent that the 28-nation European Union must reach a continent-wide agreement on sharing responsibility for sheltering more of the estimated 340,000 asylum seekers who have arrived in the 28-nation bloc already this year.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, reflecting on “a moving, in some parts breathtaking weekend behind us,” said all EU countries should help to accommodate those trying find a refuge from war in Europe.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande announced his country would welcome 24,000 refugees, while he and Merkel had agreed on a formula for spreading the migrant load across Europe. But Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, said he wasn’t prepared to pitch in and questioned how any EU quota system based on current figures could resolve the real issue of unrelenting immigration.Even as calm returned Monday to the main Austria-Hungary border crossing where more than 15,000 people crossed over the weekend en route to Germany, Hungary’s leader hit back at European partners who blamed his country for stoking the chaos.\n\nMerkel told reporters in Berlin that Germany would ensure that those who need protection receive it, but those who stand no chance of getting asylum would be swiftly returned to their homelands. Germany is preparing to receive by far the largest number of immigrants, an estimated 800,000 by the end of the year, and Merkel said other EU nations should take some. Outside the EU, British Prime Minister David Cameron said the U.K. will resettle up to 20,000 Syrians from camps in Turkey, Jordan and Syria over the next five years. Announcing the vast expansion of Britain’s refugee program, he told Parliament that Britain has a moral responsibility to act. Cameron said vulnerable children and orphans would be given priority.Orban mocked the European Union’s efforts to distribute migrants through a quota system and compared Hungary to a “black sheep” representing a voice of reason in the EU flock.He said Europe first must focus on security measures designed to force travelers from troubled lands to seek asylum in neighboring countries, not travel thousands of miles (kilometers) into the heart of Europe. He said the current discussions on a new quota to handle 120,000 migrants soon would lead to discussions on hosting millions more.“We represent the position of what the Americans call ‘first things first,’” Orban told Hungarian ambassadors meeting in Budapest. “As long as we are unable to defend Europe’s external borders, it makes no sense to talk about the fate of the immigrants.”In a related development, Hungarian Defense Minister Csaba Hende resigned Monday. The statement from Orban’s government didn’t explicitly blame him for Hungary’s failure to complete the building of a fence along Hungary’s 175-kilometer (110-mile) border with Serbia, but it was supposed to be completed last month and remains largely unfinished.Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann and other EU leaders have blamed Orban for bungling Hungary’s intake of migrants so badly that it left Austria and Germany no choice but to open their borders Saturday to thousands who had complained of neglect and human rights violations in Hungary and refused to stay in refugee camps there.\n\nHans Peter Doskozil, police chief of Burgenland in eastern Austria, said more than 15,000 people crossed from Hungary by foot, bus, train and car over the weekend. Austria ordinarily would require all asylum seekers to register there, but in an exceptional gesture permitted all to travel onward chiefly by train to Germany, their overwhelming destination of choice. Austria said Monday it intended to stop providing special trains for more migrant loads because of dissipating demand.“The situation is under control,” Austrian Railways spokesman Michael Braun said after three special trains for migrants left Vienna’s Westbahnhof for the southern German city of Munich earlier Monday.But further south on the migrants’ epic, meandering path to Germany, the situation remained fraught with fear and anger.Police near Hungary’s southern border with non-EU member Serbia tried to block hundreds of new arrivals from walking out of a field that serves as the first holding center for migrants walking across the border through a police-supervised hole in its border razor-wire defenses.\n\nTempers flared as the people, chiefly identifying themselves as Syrian, demanded to be allowed to walk away rather than wait hours for infrequent bus service that would take them to a nearby Hungarian registration camp. Police, some donning surgical masks and gloves in fear that the foreigners might have infectious diseases, pushed them back to the side of the road and insisted they must wait for buses. But the migrant numbers soon overwhelmed police, who could not stop the foreigners from reaching the M5 motorway linking the Serbian capital, Belgrade, to Budapest some 175 kilometers (110 miles) to the north.Soon, as happened Friday when thousands walked west from Budapest on the M1 motorway, hundreds were walking along the side of the two-lane road while police were reduced to blocking traffic and walking alongside the migrants.Near the village of Idomeni on Greece’s northern border with Macedonia, scuffles broke out early Monday between police and people waiting to cross, as the crowd grew to nearly 2,000. Tensions eased after authorities, who had been allowing only small groups to cross every half hour, began moving people more quickly. Eventually the crowd thinned, with an estimated 1,000 crossing by midday.\n\nGreece’s migration minister, Yiannis Mouzalas, estimated that at least two thirds of the more than 15,000 travelers stranded on the eastern Aegean island of Lesbos would be ferried to mainland Greece in the next five days. Lesbos bears the brunt of the refugee influx from nearby Turkey, with more than 1,000 arriving daily on small boats in often dangerous conditions. In a late-night meeting that lasted until early Monday in Berlin, the German government agreed to spend 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) next year to support asylum seekers. It also decided to make it easier to deport those from countries considered stable nations such as Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania.The government’s reformed aid package will include less cash in hand for asylum seekers but better non-cash benefits, including improved housing and language classes.Merkel’s deputy, Sigmar Gabriel, said integrating the migrants into society would require confronting the fears of native Germans.“I say this quite openly, there will be conflicts,” the economy minister told reporters. “The more openly we talk about the fact that people are worried, that there’s fear in the country and that there may be conflicts, will I think help us deal with this realistically and confront reality.”German media reported that five asylum seekers were injured in a fire Monday in Rottenburg in southwest Germany. Three were injured when they jumped from the burning house, while two others were treated for smoke inhalation.German officials specified no cause of the fire, though right-wing militants in Germany have set fire to other properties earmarked for asylum seekers in recent weeks.Associated Press reporters Pablo Gorondi and Alexander Kuli in Budapest, Marko Drobnjakovic in Roszke, Hungary; Lori Hinnant in Paris, Kirsten Grieshaber and Frank Jordans in Berlin, Gregory Katz in London, George Jahn in Vienna and Giannis Papanikos in Idomeni, Greece," contributed to this report.

S.," technology will be shared between the two countries to help fast-track the aircraft’s manufacture.

Officers used tear gas as they tried to disperse the crowd.\n\nThe officer then aggressively kicked her in the chest and she falls over. Silbaugh filed an internal affairs complaint alleging that the officer assaulted her by kicking her.\n\nDaneri said that at the time Silbaugh was kicked, police and a law enforcement vehicle needed to get past a line of protesters to attend to more serious violence in the area.\n\nIn a June 15 press conference, Erie Mayor Joe Schember said an investigation into the matter concluded that the officer followed approved procedures and his use of force was technically justified.\n\nSchember called the officer a veteran of the force “who has no prior complaints and has never exhibited any kind of behavior that warranted disciplinary action.”\n\nHowever, the mayor said the officer’s actions on this occasion did warrant action, and announced that he would be suspended for three days without pay and placed on desk duty until completing sensitivity training.\n\nThe mayor also noted that similar training would be required for the entire police department.\n\nDaneri said the protesters could have been charged with failure to disperse, but his office declined to file those charges because of the facts and in the interest of moving forward.\n\nSilbaugh’s lawyer, Timothy McNair," has taken legal steps toward filing a lawsuit.

You tend to use several variations of your child’s name; some are meaningful, while others are simply adorable sounds. Here are a few nicknames you can begin with for the name Heidi.\n\nWestern astrology includes the construction of a horoscope based on the person’s exact time of birth and location to understand the positions of the planet, stars, and zodiac signs at that time.  However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date. There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.\n\nTo know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below. This will give you a glimpse into the world of astrology tailored for your baby.\n\nVedic astrology, also called Jyotisha, provides deep insights into a person’s life based on celestial positions at birth. Rashi and nakshatra, which are an integral part of Jyotisha, are believed to influence an individual’s personality and life events. The following sections give you rashi-related information, such as the associated letters, elements, ruling body, quality, and nakshatra for the name Heidi. These details help analyze a person’s characteristics, personality, and behavior. As shown in the following table, each rashi is associated with specific sounds, which are often used as the starting letters of names for newborns in Hindu families. Each rashi is represented by a figure and one of the five elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether (Space). One ruling celestial body, known as its 'rashi lord' or 'ruler' is assigned to these rashis. These bodies include Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. Furthermore, the rashis are assigned various qualities or gunas.Another important aspect of Vedic Astrology is the nakshatras, the lunar constellations or star clusters that the Moon occupies during a person's birth. There are 27 nakshatras, each with its own unique qualities, attributes, and symbolism. Each rashi contains two-and-one-fourth nakshatras in it.

The U. S. government this week threatened to sanction all Supreme Court members.\n\nGuaidó lead more mass protests last week, calling for the people of Venezuela to kick Maduro out and return the country to the people. The United States also announced more sanctions against the Maduro regime. Maduro decried the events as an attempted coup.\n\n“One of the principal conspirators of the coup has just been arrested,” Diosdado Cabello, head of Maduro’s Constituent Assembly, said in comments broadcast on state television. “They will have to pay before the courts for the failed coup that they attempted,” he said.\n\nZambrano said on Twitter that SEBIN agents had surrounded his vehicle by the headquarters of his Democratic Action party in Caracas’ La Florida district.\n\n“We were surprised by the SEBIN, and after refusing to let us leave our vehicle, they used a tow truck to forcibly transfer us directly to the (SEBIN headquarters) Helicoide,” he said. It was not yet clear if Zambrano was already at the Helicoide.\n\n“The regime has kidnapped the first vice president,” Guaidó said on Twitter.\n\nGuaidó in January invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, denouncing Maduro as illegitimate after he secured re-election last year in a vote widely viewed as fraudulent. The Constituent Assembly removed Guaidó’s parliamentary immunity in early April, but authorities have not tried to arrest him since then.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Supreme Court’s head, Maikel Moreno," rebuffed the U. S. government’s threats to sanction his court’s members if they did not reject Maduro’s government and Guaidó.\n\nThe U. S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions in 2017 on Moreno and the seven principal members of the court’s constitutional chamber for rulings that “usurped the authority” of the National Assembly.\n\nU. S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the Trump administration would soon sanction the 25 remaining members of the court. Pence said on Tuesday that the United States was lifting economic sanctions on a former Venezuelan general who turned against Maduro in order to encourage other Maduro allies to follow suit.

84078136dbadeb5c2f4144cae8981622,https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/1155374#B47,mind|state|yoga|brain|system,,,Long-term practice of Pranayama and mindful breathing will increase the practitioner’s interoception on the subtle interpenetration and merge between the physiological and psychological structures of human beings [22]. During the process,,,, the union of mind and body can bring forth enduring spiritual power. When breath and consciousness are in tune, we become aware of the natural flow of our inner life force and experience how subjective consciousness can influence the physical state [19]. This “homecoming” simulates the process of our spirit returning to its roots, where the mind can release deeper insights and peace. Therefore, breath training can provide us with a journey back home—through the mind returning to the origin of the breath, ultimately retrieving our original intention [20]. This “homecoming” journey is realized through mindfulness-style breath training, bringing tranquility, unity, and joy [20]. By continuously practicing mindful breathing in yoga and cultivation, we can explore the operation of life energy within the body and establish harmonious interaction between physiological structure and subjective conscious experience. Pranayama provides us with a path to our inner rhythm [21].\n\nBreath training, or “pranayama,” as respiratory activity can act as a bridge, spanning the chasm between the conscious and unconscious realms, uniting them into a harmonious existence. The Sanskrit term “pranayama” combines “prana,” representing life energy or breath and “ayama,” denoting expansion or extension. Thus, pranayama encompasses the essence of breath control in yoga practice, serving as a critical element in yoga training. In yoga, conscious control of breathing can be considered a conduit, linking the conscious mind with physiological processes typically unconscious [14, 15]. This unique interaction can serve as a direct reminder of our innate ability to influence our physiological states through mindfulness observation. The continual inflow and outflow of breath provide a flexible and vivid phenomenon for observation, much like focused attention meditation, thereby helping to anchor our attention in the present moment and with our physical body [16, 17]. This focus on the breath can serve as a robust defense against the mental wandering or even storm in our brain that occasionally arises in our minds, granting us calmness. The relationship between physiological and psychological processes is characterized by distinct temporal dynamics. Cognitive functions generally operate at a more rapid pace compared to somatic responses, which are inherently slower and exhibit a finite range of adaptability. For instance, the human mind is capable of swiftly traversing a broad spectrum of thoughts and imaginings, often detaching from the present moment and engaging with abstract concepts or hypothetical scenarios. In contrast, the physical body is anchored here and now, constrained by the temporal and spatial limitations inherent to biological processes. By consciously coordinating breath and movement in yoga practice, we can gradually cultivate mind-body coherence. This resonance of physical and mental activities can guide the harmonious operation of our life energy, ultimately enabling our minds to become more focused, balanced, and harmonious [18].\n\nOver thousands of years of development, yoga training has formed an integrated system that includes body posture (asanas), breath control (pranayama), sensory withdrawal (pratyahara), focused attention(dharana), deep meditation (dhyana), the highest state of absorption or superconsciousness (samadhi). There is ethical guidance all through the Yoga practices. Yoga’s body movements are designed to balance different aspects of the practitioner’s physiology, promote physical health and vitality, and prepare for meditation. Breathing training plays a particularly important role in the systematic training of yoga, where the practice of breathing in and out harmonizes the flow of life force (prana), calms the mind, and regulates emotional states [11]. Both yoga and the modern fashionable mindfulness place a special emphasis on breathing [12, 13]. From a neuroscientific point of view, breathing training lies in the effectiveness of any mental training, especially with its profound physiological basis (Figure 1).\n\nFollowing the rule of causality, only the practice of Yoga with substantial action, including both the physical and mental training, can help us purify them as a unity. Training of either the body or the mind alone cannot overcome the illusion of dualistic separation. The combined physical and mental practice of Yoga helps the practitioner cultivate a sense of unity with all existence. Eventually, consciousness of the true nature of the self and the universe will appear and merge as the ultimate reality. This non-dualistic philosophy is closely related to the concept of Brahman as the source of existence and the cosmos. It is assumed that the true nature of the self is identical to the nature of Brahman. The ultimate goal of human existence is to realize this universal truth and achieve liberation and enlightenment [10].\n\nOnce the physical aspect of the body is well-trained and largely purified, the focus of practice moves on to spiritual exercises and purification. The philosophy of Yoga places particular emphasis on moral behavior and character, referred to as yamas and niyamas. Yamas incorporate principles such as non-violence, sincerity, and non-theft, while niyamas include principles such as cleanliness, contentment, and self-discipline [8]. Adhering to these moral standards is an inevitable manifestation of their practical implementation in real life. If practitioners genuinely embrace Advaita’s “non-two” or “nondualism,” they recognize that the self and the universe are not independent entities but interdependent and unified. There is no need for deception or theft as these acts are inappropriate and unnecessary [9].\n\nThe dispelling of this illusion or avidya can be achieved only through the practice of Yoga, which includes physical postures (asanas), breathing exercises (pranayama), meditation, and other spiritual practices [3, 4]. Why is spiritual liberation pursued through physical and breathing training, rather than philosophical thinking and logical deduction? This stems from the ancient law of cause and effect, which asserts that all substantive actions entail consequences [5], and physical action can have a more practical effect than pure philosophical thinking. Moreover, the physical state of the body is intertwined with, if not determinative of, the mental state [6, 7]. Therefore, the practice of Yoga seeks to purify the body and mind simultaneously, foster positive causal effects, and facilitate the attainment of greater physical happiness and spiritual growth.\n\nYoga originated in ancient India, and it is grounded in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali [1]. This holistic philosophy posits the unity of the body, mind, and spirit in humans. The practice of Yoga can lead to spiritual liberation or enlightenment, which is a pure state of consciousness and an Elysian spiritual state. A unity of the mind and body is emphasized in Yoga philosophy, extending to unity with other beings and our surroundings, and ultimately, a reunion of the self with the universe. The Yoga concept of Advaita, akin to nondualism, states that the true nature of the self mirrors the essence of the universe. However, due to avidya or ignorance, secular individuals harbor an illusion of separation between the self and others [2].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of yoga’s discourse has been fully described in other chapters of this book. This chapter will focus on the issue of mind-body unity based on the above discussion, especially from this novel perspective of modern neuroscience. The final part of the chapter will discuss other spiritual training, especially Zen Buddhism’s, and their implication for yoga training and philosophical elicitation in terms of spirituality and enlightenment.\n\nThe interconnection between mind and body is a fundamental premise of various Eastern philosophies and practices, extending beyond yoga to include traditions such as Buddhism, qigong, tai chi, and traditional Chinese medicine. These systems all underline the inseparability of physical, mental, and spiritual wellness [24]. Till to date, these concepts largely resided within the realm of philosophical discourse and personal anecdote, lacking empirical validation. While practitioners and scholars spoke of the profound effects of these mind-body practices, objective evidence remain scarce. The emergence of modern neuroscience has started to shed light on the potential mechanisms underlying these age-old wisdom. With sophisticated tools to investigate brain processes and their relationships with bodily function, it is now possible to explore these concepts with scientific rigor [25].\n\nMind-body problem is the hard problem for philosophers and scientists. Nonetheless, the complexity of mind-body relationship can be partially elucidated through the relationship between the brain and the heart. Mind can be best researched upon the brain’s responsibility. The heart, as a crucial organ, exemplifies the body’s dynamic nature. Cardiac rhythm and strength continually adjust in response to bodily demands, and cessation of cardiac activity is the gold standard for the diagnosis of death in clinics. On the other hand, psychological measurement is complex, involving both subjective experiences and objective observations of brain activity. Although we cannot directly equate the electrical activity of the brain to mental processes, these electrical patterns are currently our closest approximation of mental activity [26,27, 28]. For instance, stimulation of the brain’s somatosensory and motor regions can elicit corresponding sensory and motor responses and subjective experience. Similarly, stimulating the temporal lobe can trigger patients to recall past events and even complex images. The seizures experienced by individuals with epilepsy provide compelling evidence for the relationship between brain electrical activity and psychological states [29]. Even though we cannot yet fully equate electrical brain activity with mental processes and acknowledging that various factors, such as neurotransmitters, continually influence brain activity, neuroimaging remains the most objective measure of mental activity so far [30, 31]. As neuroscience continues to advance, we expect that the accuracy and immediacy of these measurements will improve, opening up extensive opportunities for further exploration and measurement of mind and its interaction with the physical body.\n\nEarly stages of our neuroscience research discovered that heart-brain synchronicity is enhanced during mindfulness breathing exercises [32]. Mindfulness meditation, along with other Eastern traditions that include yoga, places emphasis on both mind-body training and the aspiration to achieve unity between mind and body. Two observable aspects of the mental training are trait and state, terms familiar within psychological theory. Trait refers to the long-term changes in one’s temperament after practice, while state describes temporary changes occurring at the time of practice.\n\nOur early studies found that mindfulness training can cause temporary state changes, including synergistic alterations in heart activity and brain activity during mindful breathing. These changes primarily reflect a harmonization of the activity and cardiac activity entropy in relevant areas. However, no difference was observed before and after an 8-week training period, indicating that while state-related physical and mental changes were identified, trait-related changes were not [32]. As analytical techniques continues to advance, subsequent research found that changes in alpha wave peaks and cardiac synergy metrics increased after 8 weeks of training. This implies that 8 weeks of mindfulness training can also yield long-term benefits on traits, dominated by a change in brain-heart interaction, measured by the correlation between the peak of the frontal alpha wave and heart coherence. Brain-heart connection may be more a sensitive index to monitor mental practice [13]. This suggests that short-term mindfulness breathing exercises can immediately alter the state of physical control in the human brain, while long-term mindfulness training effects changes in the frontal lobe, the control area of human brain cognition. This corroborates the age-old wisdom that immediate adjustments can alter the physical behavior of the body, but changing mental behavior requires a more prolonged experience (Figure 2).\n\nMeanwhile, medical research and neuroscience also increasingly recognize the significance of mind-body integration, affirming the intricate interconnections between the brain and the heart. These interactions significantly influence cognitive function, emotions, and physiological processes [33, 34]. Also, our research probes into the potential links between our brain and heart, the fascinating dynamic rhythm they perform together in our physiology and psychology, and why the harmony between them matters so much to our health. Understanding these essential facts would spark fresh ideas on how one can bolster the coordination between the brain and heart through individual training, such as yoga and other meditation routines (Figure 3).\n\nThe brain and heart both have electrical activity. For example, brain has different electrical waveforms and exhibits different cognitive-emotional and arousal states. Mental concentration is accompanied by fast waves such as beta and gamma waves, and the relaxed awake state is accompanied to alpha waves. The heart generates its own electrical rhythm, which is further refined by signals from the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, two-way communication is achieved mainly through the autonomic nervous system (ANS) connection [35]. The vagus nerve is the main channel for information transmission, which transmits perceptual data about the state of the cardiovascular system through neural pathways to brain regions such as the brainstem, amygdala, and insular cortex. Cortical structures, in turn, regulate heart rate and heart function through vagus output [36]. This rate and pattern of information transmission produces rhythmic oscillations that synchronize brain and heart activity, referred to as neuropsychological coordination phenomena.\n\nIn humans, the nervous system is divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the human brain and spinal cord. The PNS is made up of the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary skeletal muscles, and the autonomic nervous system, which controls the heart muscle, smooth muscle, and glands [37]. The autonomic nervous system is further divided into the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) for fight or flight responses and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) for rest and digestion. The main communication channel between the brain and the heart is  the vagus nerve, which belongs to the PNS. However, other neural pathways exist while play minor roles in brain-heart connection [38].\n\nThe heart itself contains complex networks of clusters of nerve cells (ganglionated plexi or GP) on the outer surfaces of the atria and ventricles. These networks, located within the epicardial fat pads, constitute the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system. This system consists of interconnected GP, ganglia, and nerve fibers [39]. It interacts with the extrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system, which originates from the brain. The intrinsic GP nerve networks likely function as integrative hubs that coordinate complex autonomic signals between the extrinsic and intrinsic cardiac nervous systems, allowing sophisticated control over cardiac functions [39].\n\nThese nerves establish extensive neural connections for bidirectional information transmission and feedback between the brain and heart. These anatomical structures serve as interfaces linking the central and autonomous nervous systems and participate in the sympathetic regulation of cardiovascular and abdominal organs. The sensory nerves of the cardiovascular system and the heart convey information about blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, and oxygenation to the brainstem area  the vagus nerve, including the subnuclear area. This area integrates these visceral sensory data and sends them to brain regions, such as the amygdala and the insular cortex. Conversely, the brain regulates heart function through the vagal motor pathway, originating in the medulla oblongata. The circular respiratory center including subnuclear area can further integrate the visceral sensory data and send them to other brain regions, such as the amygdala and the insular cortex [40]. The latter is related to emotion and can influence cognition eventually.\n\nWhen EEG and ECG rhythms are synchronized and maintain a stable phase relationship, this is known as neurocardiac synchronization. It is characterized by the frequency of heart rate variability matching the EEG alpha waves. Neurocardiac synchronization forms the foundation of the brain-heart connection and significantly impacts physiological and psychological health [41]. The level of synchronization reflects the functional state of stress-related pathways. Different psychological states exhibit variations in synchronization with positive emotions and relaxed states showing higher harmony, while stress and anxiety are associated with dysregulation. As an indicator of overall resilience and adaptability, neurocardiac synchronization positively correlates with emotional stability and cognitive function [42].\n\nNeuropsychological coordination aids in achieving emotional stability and the recovery from negative emotions. The extent of coordination can indicate how effectively the cerebral dopaminergic prefrontal lobe regulates the amygdala’s emotional responses. Individuals with higher coordination levels experience lower anxiety and more robust positive emotions. Interestingly, in high-stress situations, such as combat training, individuals with greater neurocardiac coordination exhibit a reduced heart rate response and quicker recovery, indicating enhanced physiological resilience to stress [43]. A lack of brain-heart coordination often signals a poor clinical prognosis for conditions, such as depression.\n\nCoordination between brain-heart rhythms positively correlates with emotional stability, cognitive enhancement, and increased physiological resilience. For instance, the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic influences in heart rate variability affects emotional states with lower HRV in stress and depression [44]. Brain-heart connectivity significantly influences health, with ongoing studies revealing its impact on cognition, emotion, resilience, and clinical outcomes [45]. Higher cognitive readiness and capabilities are found to have a direct correlation with the index on synchronization of brain EEG alpha waves and heart rate variability with [46]. Enhanced brain-heart coordination is associated with improved performance in cognitive tasks, such as attention and memory, and this coordination is related to neurobiology of consciousness [47].\n\nThe disciplines of meditation and yoga always emphasize mind-body training that can confer benefits by optimizing neuropsychological coordination. This harmonization is considered one of the pivotal mechanisms contributing to their psychological and physiological advantages. Meditation, particularly the yoga practices is for cultivation of a synchronized relationship between the brain and the heart, which is believed to be crucial for deepening the mind-body connection. Generally, meditation practices are known to enhance the synergy between respiratory and circulatory rhythms, leading to a more coherent physiological state that supports overall well-being [48]. This improved synergy can result in a more efficient oxygen exchange and a calmer more rhythmic heartbeat, which together promote a state of relaxation and mental clarity [49]. Furthermore, the focused attention and mindfulness inherent in yoga and Zen meditation practices are instrumental in heightening inner awareness and interoception. This heightened awareness allows for a greater understanding of the body’s internal signals, fostering a deeper connection with one’s physiological states and emotional landscape [50]. Through these practices, individuals can develop a refined attunement to their internal experiences," contributing to improved self-regulation and presence.

Acrylamide is not naturally found in normal food, except when it is cooked at temperatures above 100° C.\n\nAccording to Food and Agriculture Organization, the amount of acrylamide required to cause neuropathic harm is about 500 times the daily dietary intake. So, consuming prunes is relatively safe. However, the carcinogenicity is a concern as prunes were found to be highly carcinogenic to the animals that were tested in labs.\n\nIf you have ever wondered ‘Do prunes make you poop?’ They do. If consumed in excess, the insoluble fiber in prunes can cause or worsen diarrhea. This is why you need to avoid them when you have diarrhea (2). There have also been certain cases of people who had experienced diarrhea post the ingestion of prunes and prune juice (3). But why do prunes make you poop and worsen diarrhea? This can be attributed to the laxative property of prunes. They are natural laxatives as they contain a laxative compound called sorbitol. So, an unregulated dose or having too many of these fruits can easily lead to diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance or even an allergic reaction.\n\nSome sources also talk about the dietary fructose intolerance found in many individuals, which can also lead to abdominal pain and diarrhea. Prunes contain high amounts of sugar, which might trigger such a problem.\n\nOne serving of 6 uncooked prunes contains 137 calories and 22 grams of sugar. That sure is a little on the higher end. And a one-cup serving of prune juice contains about 185 calories. Some believe that the fiber in prunes can promote satiety and possibly help with weight loss. However, taking them in excess can have the opposite effect.\n\nPrunes also have a high glycemic load (how much any particular food will raise a person’s glucose levels post consumption) (4). This means overconsuming prunes can elevate your blood sugar levels more than most other fruits.\n\nPrunes are nutritious and can be beneficial for digestion and weight loss. However, excess consumption of prunes may result in gastrointestinal issues. They contain complex carbohydrates and sugars that do not completely break down in the digestive tract (5). So, when the sugars reach the colon, the bacteria start feeding on these undigested carbohydrates.\n\nThese bacteria are responsible for intestinal gas and bloating. This can also lead to farting. You can take alpha-D-galactosidase before eating prunes as it reduces intestinal gas by breaking down the complex carbohydrates before they reach your gut.\n\nPrunes are mostly used as irritant laxatives. However, those who suffer from frequent constipation should not rely on prunes completely to clear their digestive system. This can lead to laxative dependency after a certain period of usage, which can aggravate the condition and cause nutrient deficiency among other complications (6).\n\n@Sectioned, a mental health blogger, explained how she found out about the laxative effect of prunes. She says, “Don’t take too many. Once, before I knew the laxative effect of prune juice, I drank a whole liter in one go. That’s how I know it works. Now, I just drink a glass (i).”\n\nPrunes are rich in iron and, like most iron-rich foods, can cause dark stools if taken in excess.\n\nPrunes are high in sugar and calories (7). While they can be a healthy snack option, their excessive consumption may lead to weight gain in pregnant women. However, limited data is available in this regard. They are also rich in dietary fiber and consuming them in excess may lead to several digestive issues. While pregnant women are sensitive to changes in their digestive system, it is important to eat prunes in moderation to prevent these issues.\n\nIn addition, prunes have a moderate glycemic index that may cause a gradual increase in blood sugar levels (8). Hence, it is essential to monitor the intake of prunes, especially if you are a pregnant woman with gestational diabetes or are at high risk of developing it.\n\nPrunes have their own set of side effects, but you can still consume them in moderation. Also, consult your doctor if you experience any side effects from eating prunes.\n\n“Yes. Since prunes are rich in soluble fiber content, this slows down the absorption of the natural sugar they contain. They are low-glycemic fruits, perfect for people with diabetes. But it’s essential to note that quantity is important. If someone with diabetes eats too many prunes, their sugar intake may be too high. So, two to three prunes per day is a good serving size for people with diabetes,” says Eva De Angelis, Dietitian Nutritionist.\n\nEva De Angelis says, “It depends. While some foods have been linked to acid reflux, the effects can be different for different people. And this also applies to prunes. For some, this dried fruit can be a healthy choice and even make them feel better. Yet, for others, prunes can lead to acid reflux.”\n\n“No. Prunes made just from plums, with no added sugar, are nourishing and rich in fiber, calcium, boron, and potassium, all essential minerals for bone health. A serving size of 5 to 6 prunes per day is a good amount. Yet, like any dried fruit, they are high in natural sugars, so eating too much can be detrimental.” says Eva.\n\nWhat happens if you eat prunes every day?\n\nPrunes are loaded with many beneficial nutrients. However, eating them in excess may cause diarrhea.\n\nPrunes contain sorbitol, which is hard to digest for some people. This may trigger stomach aches, bloating, and mild nausea.\n\nEva De Angelis says, “This greatly depends on each individual and on the type of IBS they have. For example, if you have IBS with mostly constipation, prunes can act as a natural laxative due to their high fiber content. But if you experience IBS with mostly diarrhea," they are not the best choice.”\n\nDiscover the potential side effects of eating too many prunes.

The added protection peaked at 26.5 percent protection and dropped to 21.7 percent protection after 34 days.\n\nLimitations of the paper included not examining the long-term protection from the bivalent vaccines. Funding came from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. Authors declared no conflicts of interest.\n\nThe bivalent vaccines were available in the United States, Japan, and some other countries from the fall of 2022 to the fall of 2023. They were introduced, without clinical trial data, because the original vaccines stopped performing as well against emerging variants of the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nThe shots were widely recommended in the United States.\n\nThe bivalent vaccines have since been replaced by new monovalent shots that target the XBB.1.5 virus subvariant, although that strain has since been displaced in many places.\n\nIn Japan, the new shots are available to the population but authorities are only recommending them to the elderly and people with underlying health problems.\n\nIn the United States, officials recommend the new shots for virtually every person aged 6 months or older, regardless of whether they’ve been infected before. Just 22 percent of adults and 11 percent of children have received one of the new shots, according to the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n“We do need nuance in our vaccine recommendations—vaccination has less benefit in younger people, those generally healthy, and in those recovered from infection,” said Dr. Klausner, who was not involved in the research. “Vaccine efforts should be targeted to those most at risk of complications and severe disease like the elderly, those with chronic medical conditions or immunocompromise or in either of those groups without prior infection.”\n\nAmong vaccinated people who did not have prior infection, protection for both versions was estimated to be about 35 percent.\n\n“The BA.1-based bivalent vaccine was effective only in individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection,” the researchers said.\n\nThe study’s limitations included a lack of stratification by vaccine manufacturer, funding came from the Korea University College of Medicine, and no disclosures were listed.\n\nThe researchers examined records of adults aged 60 or older who experienced severe acute respiratory infection between February and August 2023. They estimated vaccine effectiveness started at 80 percent against the infection but dropped to 0 percent beyond 269 days.\n\nThe researchers did not adjust for prior infection," a fact they listed as one of the limitations of the paper. Funding came from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Declared conflicts included sponsorship from Pfizer for one author and payments from Pfizer for another.

She maintains that the CPP is still worthwhile because,,,, were likely to follow our lead.\n\nBut developing countries have indicated that they have no intention of following us. They will not limit their development for “climate protection” purposes.\n\nFor example, on July 18, Philippines’ President Rodrigo Duterte said about the Paris climate agreement, “You are trying to stymie [our growth] with an agreement... That’s stupid. I will not honor that.”\n\nDuterte can say this with a clear conscience. The United Framework Convention on Climate Change, the foundation of the Paris Agreement, gives an out clause for developing nations. Article 4 of the treaty states, “Economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties.”\n\nActions to significantly reduce CO emissions would entail dramatically cutting back on the use of coal, the source of 81 percent of China’s electricity, 71 percent of India’s, and 29 percent of that of the Philippines. As coal is by far the least expensive source of electric power in most of the world, reducing CO emissions by restricting coal use would unquestionably interfere with development priorities. So developing countries simply won’t do it.\n\nFrom a climate change perspective, it probably won’t matter. After all, even the U. N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change admits that surface temperature, averaged over the land and ocean, increased only about 1.5 degrees between 1880 to 2012 despite a reputed 36 percent rise in atmospheric CO content. And it is well known that the impact of CO rise diminishes as the concentration increases.\n\nGiven also that there has been no general increase in extreme weather or the rate of sea level rise, the primary rationale for actions to restrict CO emissions boils down to the possibility of dangerous climate change in the future.\n\nObama summed up this concern in his Sept. 20 speech to the U. N. General Assembly, saying, “If we don’t act boldly [to restrict emissions], the bill that could come due will be mass migrations, and cities submerged and nations displaced, and food supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair.”\n\nObama’s forecasts are based on computer models of future climate states, simulations that have failed in the real world. In his Feb. 2, 2016 testimony before the U. S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space & Technology, Dr. John Christy, distinguished professor of atmospheric science at The University of Alabama in Huntsville, said, “These models failed at the simple test of telling us ‘what’ has already happened, and thus would not be in a position to give us a confident answer to ‘what’ may happen in the future and ‘why.’”\n\nAfter polling 9.7 million people from 194 countries, the U. N.’s My World global survey finds that “action taken on climate change” rates dead last out of the 16 suggested priorities for the agency. The judges hearing the CPP case must realize that, in comparison with access to reliable energy, better health care, government honesty, a good education, etc., most people across the world do not care about climate change. They understand that we have real problems to solve.\n\nTom Harris is executive director of the Ottawa," Canada-based International Climate Science Coalition.

Hearings typically last only about an hour.\n\nBoth supporters and opponents of the Affordable Care Act have been holding demonstrations to make their voices heard.\n\nIt's health care for everybody. It's very important, said Jasper Johnson, a 26-year-old computer technician who came from San Francisco, and was among the handful of people camping out since Friday for the few seats set aside for the public to watch the start of the proceedings.\n\nI'm here not only for myself but for the economy as a whole.\n\nBut many Republicans oppose the measure, with frontrunning White House hopeful Mitt Romney calling the law an unfolding disaster for the American economy.\n\nThe ruling could have enormous political ramifications, analysts say, especially if the court strikes down part or all of the reform.\n\nIlya Shapiro, a senior fellow for the conservative public policy foundation Cato Institute, said the case could cost Obama his job.\n\nIf the law is struck down, then the administration's signature achievement is gone, Shapiro told AFP.\n\nThe law, enacted in 2010 but which will not come fully into force until 2014, is Obama's greatest accomplishment, realizing a long-held dream of generations of Democrats.\n\nBut Republicans seeking to thwart Obama's bid for a second term in the White House see it as an assault on individual liberties, and have vowed to repeal it if elected in the November presidential elections.\n\nThe main controversy focuses on a measure that requires all Americans to purchase personal health insurance from 2014 or face fines.\n\nIf they can force you to buy health insurance, they can force you to buy a car, asparagus, a gym membership, said Kenneth Cuccinelli, attorney general of Virginia, one of 26 states seeking to overturn the law.\n\nOther provisions bar insurance companies from refusing to insure people with pre-existing or chronic conditions, who are often now rejected for coverage or forced to pay exorbitant premiums.\n\nThe companies must also provide certain kinds of coverage that previously were excluded, such as contraception.\n\nOpponents argue Congress exceeded its constitutional authority by approving the law.\n\nThe US Justice Department has hit back arguing the law is within the authority of Congress to regulate commerce and to tax citizens.\n\nSenior White House adviser David Plouffe said the government's solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, is going to put forward a very powerful case for why this law is constitutional and why it's important.\n\nBackers say Americans who lack health care are less productive and often push their unpaid health bills onto taxpayers, who are forced to subsidize emergency room visits.\n\nPaul Clement, a former solicitor general who will argue the other side for the 26 states challenging the law, says he will argue it is unprecedented and an imposition on citizens.\n\nBecause of the massive public interest, the court plans to release audio recordings of the debates on the same day as the hearings, which are expected to be packed with visitors in the marble-columned courtroom. Attorney General Eric Holder plans to attend.\n\nAmong the nine Supreme Court justices, five were appointed by Republican presidents and four by Democrats.\n\nWhile a ruling is not expected until June, the justices must first decide whether they can rule on a law that has not yet taken effect. Then they must determine whether the health insurance requirement violates the constitution.\n\nSome legal experts say that without the health insurance requirement, the entire law will be moot.\n\nOnce you take the heart out of a body, it doesn't matter if the fingers can still move, said Michael Carvin," attorney for the National Federation of Independent Business.

Carbimazole is the most commonly used medicine. You may require careful monitoring to get the right levels of these medicines for you. Most of the side-effects experienced are minor. However,,,, or it may be used in a thyrotoxic crisis. Propylthiouracil is also used for an overactive thyroid gland in pregnancy. Your doctor will advise you on which is the most suitable for you.\n\nGetting the right balance of thyroid hormone in your blood can take time. Doctors have two main methods of trying to get the balance right.\n\nThe first involves taking an initial high dose of carbimazole to reduce the amount of thyroxine in your blood. This dose is taken until the hormone levels in your blood have stabilised, usually about four to eight weeks later.\n\nBecause your body needs a certain amount of thyroxine to function properly, the high dose is then slowly decreased. Usually, your hormone levels will be checked by a blood test every month or so.\n\nThe dose of medicine you are taking will be changed depending upon the results of your thyroid hormone levels. The aim of this treatment is to keep you on the lowest level of antithyroid medicine necessary. This treatment method is called 'titration'.\n\nIt can be difficult for a doctor to judge just the right dose of carbimazole to give in each case. Too much treatment may make the thyroxine level go too low. Not enough treatment means the level remains higher than normal. This is the reason for the regular blood tests and careful monitoring.\n\nThe second option is to deliberately take a high dose of carbimazole each day. This stops the thyroid gland making any thyroxine. Your doctor can then prescribe a daily dose of thyroxine to keep the blood level of thyroxine normal. This 'over-treatment' coupled with taking replacement thyroxine is called 'block and replace' and is a popular option.\n\nIt is generally thought that the 'block and replace' method results in better control of thyroid hormone levels. However, the risk of experiencing an adverse effect from the higher dose of antithyroid medicine may be higher.\n\nThese medicines should have some effect on your symptoms around 10 to 14 days after treatment starts. Thyroid hormone levels are usually stabilised within four to eight weeks of taking the medication.\n\nThis may vary depending on the way in which you take your medicines. Hyperthyroidism is what is known as a relapsing-remitting illness. This means that the symptoms of the condition may get better (remit) or get worse (relapse).\n\nMedical evidence suggests that about half of people treated by the titration method will get better (achieve remission) after 18 to 24 months of treatment. However, about half of those treated by the 'block and replace' method will achieve remission within six months of treatment.\n\nYour doctor will advise you on which treatment option may be suitable for you. 'Block and replace' therapy is not suitable in pregnancy.\n\nAs mentioned before, having an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) is generally a relapsing-remitting illness, which means symptoms may return after treatment.\n\nIf you feel unwell following treatment you should return to your doctor. Your GP should be able to advise you on the type of symptoms to look out for.\n\nIt is usually advisable to treat an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause significant problems with your heart and other organs. It may also increase your risk of complications should you become pregnant. However, in many cases there are other treatment options. That is, radioactive iodine or surgery may be suitable options.\n\nSee the separate leaflet called Overactive Thyroid Gland (Hyperthyroidism) for details of these other treatment options.\n\nMost people who take antithyroid medicines do not experience any side-effects. The side-effects that most commonly occur are:\n\nThe above side-effects are usually not serious and often go, even if you continue with the medication.\n\nA rare but serious side-effect is an effect on the bone marrow which produces red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Antithyroid drug therapy can reduce the numbers of these cells being produced. The lower number of red blood cells causes anaemia. The effect on white blood cells (or neutrophils) is called agranulocytosis. The drastically reduced number of white blood cells in your body may mean you are less able to fight off infection. The reduced number of platelets may make you more likely to bleed. Therefore, if you experience any of these whilst on the medicine, you must stop taking it and report this to your doctor immediately, if you develop:\n\n* Any other signs of infection.\n\nAs noted above, a mild rash is a common side-effect. The rash associated with this rare but serious effect on blood-making cells is different. Therefore, when taking an antithyroid medicine, always report a rash to a doctor who can then decide if it is a common and minor problem or the more serious rash.\n\nYou cannot buy these medicines. They are only available from your chemist, with a doctor's prescription, and are usually started by a specialist doctor.\n\nPregnant women or those planning a baby should seek the advice of their GP, as these medicines are able to cross the placenta. The placenta is the organ that provides nourishment and oxygen to a baby in the womb (uterus). Antithyroid medicines may not be suitable for people with some forms of liver or kidney disease.\n\nA full list of people who should not take antithyroid medicines is included with the information leaflet that comes with your medicine. Read this to be sure you are safe to take it.\n\nThese medicines sometimes react with other medicines that you may take. So, make sure your doctor knows of any other medicines that you are taking, including ones that you have bought rather than been prescribed.\n\nWhen you look up this condition on the internet, there will be some kind of 'natural remedy' that promises a great cure without all those 'nasty medicines' that doctors prescribe.\n\nBe careful: an overactive thyroid gland is a potentially serious condition, particularly for your heart. It's best to get an opinion from a qualified doctor (MBChB or MBBS), preferably one who is impartial and paid by a state-funded system like the NHS, before trying any homeopathic treatments.\n\nWhen someone has an underactive thyroid gland, they are given a medicine to boost their levels of thyroxine. This medicine is called levothyroxine. Sometimes this can help the person lose weight, if their underactive thyroid gland has caused them to put on weight. See the separate leaflet called Underactive Thyroid Gland (Hypothyroidism).\n\nUnfortunately, as you can imagine," some unscrupulous people get hold of levothyroxine and then try to sell it as a 'weight loss' cure.\n\nBe careful: it's true that taking lots of levothyroxine could make you lose weight but it will also be very harmful to your body. It will turn you into having an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) with all of the bad effects of that condition that have been discussed in this leaflet.\n\nThe best and healthiest way to lose weight is to eat healthily and be active. See the separate leaflet called Weight Loss (Weight Reduction) for help on losing weight.

Although they have been popular for years,,,, they may now proudly show it off a tattoo as a standalone statement piece. Not to mention that visually striking tattoos make for a great choice for those who like bigger, bolder tattoos. These badass pieces of ink are also ruling the trend charts like no other! This type of body art makes for a top choice for those who exhibit strength, fierceness, and resilience.\n\nBlack tattoo ink designs may connote different things for different individuals, they are considered to be a classic example of cultural appropriation. To explore why, we delve into tattooing practices across different ethnic groups in the next section.\n\nOne of the most negative aspects of blackout tattoos is that they are commonly associated with cultural appropriation. Cultural appropriation may reinforce stereotypes about or disregard traditions of a community. It can also add to the marginalization of a community that’s already on the sidelines. Especially in the United States, the practice of ‘blackface’ in the late 19th and early 20th century had set an uninspiring precedent for African-American people to accept blackout tattoos on white people. Blackface was a type of theatrical practice where non-Black performers mocked people of color by darkening their skin using black paint and wearing outlandish costumes to make a caricature of the black peoples as a whole.\n\nFurther, historically, what is today known as blackout tattoos were inked for cultural and ceremonial purposes in various African, South Asian, and Polynesian tribal communities to symbolize a rite of passage or to indicate one’s social status. Thus, when a white person who is divorced from the cultural or historical context of this tattoo type actually does it to appear trendy, it can be seen as offensive by people of color. While views on this can widely vary among individuals within these cultures, the fact remains that people of color still have to endure daily discrimination based on the color of their skin.\n\nHaving said that, the interpretation of these tattoos varies according to trends, popular culture, cultural context, placement, and individual perspectives. They may not necessarily mean scandalous or disrespectful in general. However, it is important to understand the cultural context associated with tattoos to avoid causing unintentional offense and perpetuating stereotypes. It’s important to remember tattoos are not just an aesthetic choice, they hold cultural, historical, and personal significance.\n\nIf you have already got blackout tattoos and are considering removing them, then there are some steps you should be careful about. The next section takes you through all you need to know about the blackout tattoo removal  process.\n\nUnlike popular beliefs, be it a black armband tattoo, or a solid black one, black tattoos are harder to remove than other colors. Having said that, the size of the tattoo, the complexity of the design, and how deep the ink has penetrated the skin can determine whether the tattoo removal process will be easy or complicated as a whole. In general, the process of blackout tattoo removal is the same as for other tattoos, but the procedure might turn out to be more complex and time-consuming.\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that while it might take an average tattoo 3-8 weeks to fade and be removed completely, the same process might take up to around 15 sessions to get that job done for a blackout tattoo. Not just that, the blackout tattoo removal process is even hard on the pocket, since removing a smaller tattoo is relatively cheaper than larger ones.\n\nHowever, black ink tattoos can be easily removed with laser treatment. One need not worry about the darkness of the pigment with lasers. Nonetheless, before taking the plunge, it is important to keep in mind that the blackout tattoo removal process is long-drawn, expensive, painful and requires a lot of patience as you may have to sit through multiple sessions. Always consult with a tattoo artist or medical professional who will be able to customize the tattoo removal plan according to your blackout tattoo, ensuring you get the best care and price.\n\nAfter getting a tattoo, the affected area might look red, swollen, and irritated. To lower the inflammation one can apply ice to the area to soothe it and minimize discomfort (1). However, if you experience increasing pain, or pus, or notice the signs of infection, contact a dermatologist immediately. Besides that, try keeping the tattooed body elevated to improve blood circulation and speed up the healing process.\n\nBut how long does it actually take for a blackout tattoo to heal? Let us find out in the next session.\n\nThe blackout tattoo healing  process is pretty much the same as a regular tattoo. It can roughly take 2-3 weeks to 6 months for the tattoo to heal completely (2). During the wound recovery process, it is important to keep the targeted area clean at all times. One can use unscented, antibacterial soap and lukewarm water to wash the area twice a day. In addition, one can use a post-tattoo lotion over the tattooed area to soothe the irritated, inflamed skin for optimal healing. Above all, adhere to the aftercare instructions provided by your tattoo artist to reduce the risk of infection and allow the skin to heal properly.\n\nAnother important point that one must understand is that blackout tattoos might feel slightly more itchier than normal tattoos, due to their large size, greater concentration and amount of pigment, and the complexity of the design. In addition to that, one should bear in mind that there is no real difference between the healing process of blackout tattoos when compared to normal tattoos, it’s just that these tattoos are done on a larger area in a more concentrated and intensive way. Lastly, since blackout tattoos cover up a large area of the skin, they also make it difficult to spot changes in the skin color and texture, which might be indicative of an impending larger health issue. This also means that one should be regular with check-ups and yearly health appointments to stay at the top of their health.\n\nBlackout tattoos are vast, mysterious, and command attention like no other! They are more than cover-ups and are one of the boldest tattoo trends today. On the contrary, they are also controversial at the same time, however, if you have decided to get one, make sure to go to a reputable tattoo studio and choose an artist with experience working on blackout tattoos. However, make sure to do your research and ensure that strict hygienic practices are followed during the blackout tattooing process.\n\nWhat needle is used for blackout tattoos?\n\nMagnum needles with more spacing between each other are typically used for tattooing blackout tattoos, which involve covering the larger surface area of the skin.\n\nHow much is a blackout tattoo?\n\nThe average cost of getting a blackout tattoo is somewhere between $100-$300 on an hourly basis. However, the rates can vary depending on the location of the tattoo studio, reputation of the tattoo artist, consultation charges, etc.\n\nHow do you sleep with a blackout tattoo?\n\nBefore going to bed," one should wear loose clothes that do not cover the area around freshly tattooed skin. Ensure to sleep on clean bedding and in a position such that the tattooed area does not come in contact with the bedding.\n\nUsing a direct drive machine and needles one is comfortable with can help make the blackout tattooing process a breeze. The following video discusses some tips on how one can get an even and consistent blackout tattoo. Check it out!

Editors have highlighted                                                     the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nResearchers have found that digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has improved breast cancer screening performance in community practice and identifies more invasive cancers,,,, DBT was rapidly adopted in the U.S. As of September 2022, 84% of all mammography screening facilities in the U.S. had DBT units.\n\nBreast cancer mortality reduction from routine screening is contingent upon radiologists' interpretive performance. Since the Mammography Quality Standards Act was enacted in 1992, screening facilities and interpreting radiologists have been required to meet minimum quality standards. Beginning in 2006, the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) has published screening performance benchmarks. The BCSC is a collaborative network of breast imaging registries conducting research to assess and improve the delivery and quality of breast cancer screening and related patient outcomes.\n\nTo establish performance benchmarks for DBT screening and evaluate performance trends over time in U. S. community practices, the research team collected DBT screening exams from five BCSC registries between 2011 and 2018.\n\nCompared to BCSC digital mammography screening exams from the same time period and previously published BCSC and National Mammography Database performance benchmarks, all performance measures were higher for DBT except sensitivity and false-negative rate, which were similar to concurrent and prior digital mammography performance measures.\n\nRadiologists appear to perform better with digital breast tomosynthesis and have higher accuracy on screening 3D mammograms than 2D mammograms across U. S. practices, Dr. Lee noted. As this becomes the mainstay screening modality, we hope to see improved screening outcomes for women.\n\nA total of 896,101 women undergoing 2,301,766 screening exams—458,175 DBT and 1,843,591 2D digital mammography—were included in the retrospective study. The abnormal interpretation rate was 8.3%, cancer detection rate was 5.8 per 1,000 exams, sensitivity was 87.4%, and specificity was 92.2%.\n\nWith DBT,97.60%,91.80%,75.00%, and 74.0% of assessed radiologists achieved the recommended acceptable performance ranges for cancer detection rate, sensitivity, abnormal interpretation rate and specificity, respectively.\n\nDr. Lee notes that these benchmarks are also very important for the emerging field of artificial intelligence.\n\nAny new AI tools aimed at improving mammography accuracy will have to revise their own performance goals based on the improved radiologist performance with DBT," he said.
