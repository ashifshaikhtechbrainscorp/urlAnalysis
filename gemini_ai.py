content = """Cardiovascular disease is the most prevalent cause of death worldwide.
High blood pressure or hypertension is a risk factor for heart disease, and it affects at least one out of
three people in the United States. As potentially damaging as it can be, hypertension is largely preventable.
Though many popular foods cause inflammation, oxidative stress, and chronic hypertension, others can lower or
prevent high blood pressure naturally.

Sesame Oil
Sesame oil has demonstrated beneficial effects on blood lipid concentrations and arterial blood pressure.
In a 2012 study, participants who consumed sesame oil achieved short- and long-term lower blood pressure
readings with noticeable differences within an hour of ingestion. The exact mechanism by which sesame oil
lowers blood pressure isn't clear. Researchers believe the antioxidants and healthy fats in the oil may
play a role."""
