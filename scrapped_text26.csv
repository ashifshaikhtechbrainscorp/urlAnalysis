Credit: Adapted and used with permission from Amgen A new type of targeted immunotherapy drug shrank tumors in about one in three people with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the most aggressive form of lung cancer, according to results from a clinical trial. The findings are encouraging because little progress has been made in treating advanced SCLC, experts said. Many people with SCLC respond to initial treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. But the cancer usually progresses despite additional treatment, with most of these patients dying within weeks or months. The early-stage clinical trial tested two different doses of an experimental drug called tarlatamab in people with SCLC whose cancer had progressed after at least two previous types of treatment. Many people in the study had already received at least three different treatments. In the trial, tumors shrank in 40% of people given 10 mg of tarlatamab every 2 weeks and in about 32% of people who received a 100 mg dose. Furthermore, in more than half of all patients whose tumors shrank with tarlatamab, the treatment kept the cancer at bay for at least 6 months—and in many, it did so for 9 months or longer. This last finding was especially noteworthy, said Anish Thomas, M.D., of NCI’s Center for Cancer Research, who studies SCLC but was not involved in the trial. “This is probably one of the most promising treatments being tested in small cell lung cancer right now,” Dr. Thomas said. The new findings are “hopeful for patients and the people who treat them, especially since this is such an aggressive disease with very few advances in treatment since the 1980s,” he continued. Results of the trial—known as DeLLphi-301 and funded by Amgen, the company that makes tarlatamab—were presented October 20 at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) in Madrid and published the same day in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The new findings “support the use of tarlatamab in these previously treated patients,” said the trial’s senior investigator, Luis Paz-Ares, M.D., Ph.D., of Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre in Madrid, who presented the results at the ESMO meeting. The findings are “encouraging,” agreed Pilar Garrido, M.D., Ph.D., of Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal in Madrid, who spoke about the trial at the ESMO meeting but was not involved in it. However, she noted that patients need to be hospitalized to manage potentially serious side effects when they first receive the drug, which poses logistical challenges to its use. Dr. Garrido also noted the need for more data on the effectiveness of tarlatamab against SCLC that has spread to the brain and for a biomarker that can predict which patients will respond to the drug. According to Dr. Paz-Ares, the manufacturer of tarlatamab has already launched a large clinical trial comparing tarlatamab with standard chemotherapy in people with SCLC that has come back after one initial treatment. Tarlatamab harnesses T cells to destroy small cell lung cancer cells Tarlatamab is a type of immunotherapy known as a bispecific T-cell engager, or BiTE. These two-armed drugs simultaneously latch onto tumor cells and immune cells called T cells. By bringing T cells and cancer cells close together, they help the T cell recognize and destroy the cancer cell. The arm of tarlatamab that targets small cell lung cancer cells attaches to a protein called DLL3. This protein is normally located inside cells but is often present at high levels on the surface of SCLC cells, where it can be recognized by tarlatamab. That makes DLL3 “a very attractive target in SCLC,” Dr. Garrido said. The trial enrolled more than 200 people with advanced, or extensive-stage, SCLC that had progressed or was no longer responding to treatment. All of the participants had previously been treated with chemotherapy, and many had also been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, a different type of immunotherapy drug. All participants had received at least two prior therapies, and one-third had received three or more. The study team analyzed the response to tarlatamab in 100 participants who received 10 mg of tarlatamab by infusion every 2 weeks and another 88 who received 100 mg every 2 weeks. An additional 34 patients on the 10-mg dose were included in the analysis of side effects. The 40% response rate (tumor shrinkage) seen in the 10-mg group “far exceeded” the 15% response rate that has historically been seen in people treated with standard therapies for SCLC that has relapsed, Dr. Paz-Ares and his colleagues wrote in NEJM. Furthermore, 30% of those patients who responded to the drug had responses lasting at least 9 months. That finding is “exciting,” Dr. Thomas said, because the cancer usually grows so rapidly. The median time that people in the 10-mg group lived after starting on tarlatamab was 14.3 months, compared with 6–12 months with current treatments. Researchers are still following the trial participants to learn more about tarlatamab’s side effects and its impact on how long people live. Based on the initial results of DeLLphi-301, the lower (10 mg) dose of tarlatamab will be used in future clinical trials, Dr. Paz-Ares said. Common and potentially serious side effects of tarlatamab The side effects of tarlatamab were generally “manageable,” Dr. Paz-Ares said, and only about 3% of patients in the study stopped treatment entirely because of side effects. In addition, 13% of people in the 10-mg group and 29% in the 100-mg group had to temporarily pause treatment, have their dose reduced, or both, due to side effects. The most common side effect of tarlatamab was cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction in which inflammation spreads throughout the body. Other common side effects included decreased appetite, fever, and anemia. About one-third of the patients experienced severe side effects, including serious cases of cytokine release syndrome. Severe side effects were more frequent in those receiving the higher dose of tarlatamab. Most cases of cytokine release syndrome were “manageable and typically treated with supportive care,” such as intravenous fluids and drugs to control fever and inflammation, Dr. Paz-Ares said. However, one person in the 10-mg group died from respiratory failure resulting from treatment. Another potentially serious side effect of tarlatamab is ICANS (immune effector cell−associated neurotoxicity syndrome), which includes a host of neurological effects such as severe confusion, attention problems, tremor, and muscle weakness. ICANS was more common in patients in the 100-mg treatment group and led one patient in each dose group to stop treatment entirely. Both ICANS and cytokine release syndrome are commonly seen with immunotherapies that activate T cells to kill cancer cells, including other BiTEs and CAR T-cell therapy. Challenges, concerns, and questions remain Dr. Thomas noted that the trial was not designed to compare tarlatamab with standard therapy for SCLC. “But there is strong historical data on how quickly the disease progresses with standard therapy.” Another issue, he said, is that current practice calls for treating all patients with extensive-stage SCLC with chemotherapy plus an immune checkpoint inhibitor at the time of diagnosis. However, about one in four people in the trial had not been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. So it would be good to know how well tarlatamab works specifically for people whose cancer has come back despite previous immunotherapy, he explained. Possible side effects are also a concern. There were few severe cases of cytokine release syndrome in the trial and most occurred after the first or second dose of tarlatamab. Still, the potential risk of side effects with early doses “is an important consideration,” Dr. Thomas said, because patients had to be hospitalized for a couple of days as a precaution when receiving each of the first two or three infusions of tarlatamab. In addition, people had to be in generally good physical condition to participate in the trial, and the impact of potentially serious side effects could be greater in those who are sicker, he continued. For all these reasons, Dr. Thomas said, it will be important to know “how we can best manage side effects such that we don’t need to admit patients to the hospital, and how we can anticipate, prevent, and treat side effects.” He also pointed out that some patients died within 6 weeks after their treatment began, before the study team could assess if the deaths were due to worsening of the cancer. And “we need to better understand whether these early deaths were due to side effects,” he said. Finally, Dr. Garrido said, another challenge is identifying biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to respond to tarlatamab. The research team looked at DLL3 on tumor cells as a potential biomarker, but whether a person responded to the drug did not appear to be linked to having DLL3 in their tumors, the study team reported. “Despite the many challenges,” Dr. Garrido said, the results “offer renewed hope to our patients.” < Older Post Groundbreaking Trial Results Expand Treatment Options for Some People with Bladder Cancer Newer Post > What Comes after NCI-MATCH?

These exams and tests often include: Taking your health history. Your health care team may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, physical activity and exercise habits. You also may talk about your eating patterns and appetite control. Your health care professional may ask about other conditions you've had, medicines you take, your stress levels and other issues about your health. They may also review your family's health history to see if you may be more likely to have certain conditions. A general physical exam. This includes measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen. Calculating your BMI. Your health care professional checks your body mass index, called BMI. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obesity. Numbers higher than 30 increase health risks even more. Have your BMI checked at least once a year. This can help pinpoint your overall health risks and what treatments may be right for you. Measuring your waist size. The distance around your waist is known as the circumference. Fat stored around the waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Women with a waist that measures more than 35 inches (89 centimeters) and men with a waist that's more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) around may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, waist circumference should be checked at least once a year. Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your health care team will evaluate them. Your health care professional also will check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, underactive thyroid, liver problems and diabetes. Gathering this information will help you and your health care team choose the type of treatment that will work best for you. Care at Mayo Clinic Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your obesity-related health concerns Start Here More InformationObesity care at Mayo ClinicCholesterol testLiver function testsBMI and waist circumference calculatorShow more related information TreatmentThe goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. This improves overall health and lowers the risk of developing complications related to obesity. You may need to work with a team of health professionals — including a dietitian, behavioral counselor or an obesity specialist — to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits. The first treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss — 5% to 10% of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms), you'd need to lose only about 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kilograms) for your health to begin to improve. But the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits. All weight-loss programs require that you change your eating habits and get more active. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your weight, your overall health and your willingness to participate in a weight-loss plan. Dietary changesReducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are key to overcoming obesity. Although you may lose weight quickly at first, steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest way to lose weight. It's also the best way to keep weight off permanently. There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include: Cutting calories. The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. The first step is to review your typical eating and drinking habits. You can see how many calories you usually consume and where you can cut back. You and your health care professional can decide how many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight. A typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men. Feeling full on less. Some foods — such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods — contain a lot of calories for a small portion. In contrast, fruits and vegetables provide a larger portion size with fewer calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you can reduce hunger pangs and take in fewer calories. You also may feel better about your meal, which contributes to how satisfied you feel overall. Making healthier choices. To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods. These include fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Also emphasize lean sources of protein — such as beans, lentils and soy — and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week. Limit salt and added sugar. Eat small amounts of fats, and make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils. Restricting certain foods. Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your health care professional which diet plans are effective and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended. Limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories. Meal replacements. These plans suggest replacing one or two meals each day with their products — such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars — and eating healthy snacks. Then you have a healthy, balanced third meal that's low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. But these diets likely won't teach you how to change your overall lifestyle. So you may have to stay on the diet if you want to keep your weight off. Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. But the reality is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, but the long-term results don't appear to be any better than other diets. Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you're likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To lose weight — and keep it off — you must adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over time. Exercise and activityGetting more physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment: Exercise. People with obesity need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity. This can help prevent further weight gain or maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. You'll probably need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve. Keep moving. Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. For example, park farther from store entrances and take the stairs instead of the elevator. A pedometer can track how many steps you take over the course of a day. Many people try to reach 10,000 steps every day. Gradually increase the number of steps you take daily to reach your goal. Behavior changesA behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes to lose weight and keep it off. Steps to take include looking at your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may have contributed to your obesity. Counseling. Talking with a mental health professional can help address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You also can learn how to monitor your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Counseling can be one-on-one or in a group. Support groups. You can find friendship and understanding in support groups where others share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your health care team, local hospitals or commercial weight-loss programs for support groups in your area. Weight-loss medicinesWeight-loss medicines are meant to be used along with diet, exercise and behavior changes, not instead of them. Before selecting a medication for you, your health care professional will consider your health history, as well as possible side effects. The most commonly used medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity include: Bupropion-naltrexone (Contrave). Liraglutide (Saxenda). Orlistat (Alli, Xenical). Phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia). Semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy). Weight-loss medicines may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. When you stop taking a weight-loss medicine, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost. Endoscopic procedures for weight lossThese types of procedures don't require any cuts, also called incisions, in the skin. After you are under anesthesia, flexible tubes and tools are inserted through the mouth and down the throat into the stomach. Common procedures include: Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty. This procedure involves placing stitches in the stomach to reduce the amount of food and liquid the stomach can hold at one time. Over time, eating and drinking less helps the average person lose weight. Intragastric balloon for weight loss. In this procedure, you have a small balloon placed into the stomach. The balloon is then filled with water to reduce the amount of space in the stomach, so you'll feel full eating less food. Intragastric balloons are left in place for up to 6 months and are then removed using an endoscope. At that time, a new balloon may be placed, or not, depending on the plan determined by you and your health care team. Weight-loss surgeryAlso known as bariatric surgery, weight-loss surgery limits how much food you can eat. Some procedures also limit the amount of calories and nutrients you can absorb. But this also can result in nutritional and vitamin deficiencies. Common weight-loss surgeries include: Adjustable gastric banding. In this surgery, an inflatable band placed around the outside of the stomach divides it into two pouches. The surgeon pulls the band tight, like a belt, to create a narrow pathway between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from getting bigger. The band often stays in place permanently. Gastric bypass surgery. In gastric bypass, also called Roux-en-Y (roo-en-wy) gastric bypass, the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into this part of the intestine, bypassing most of the stomach. Gastric sleeve. In this surgery, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food. It's a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. Other treatmentsOther treatments for obesity include: Hydrogels. Available by prescription, these edible capsules contain tiny particles that absorb water and get bigger in the stomach, to help you feel full. The capsules are taken before meals and are passed through the intestines as stool. Vagal nerve blockade. This involves implanting a device under the skin in the stomach area. The device sends electrical pulses to a nerve in that area, called the abdominal vagus nerve. This nerve tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. Gastric aspirate. In this procedure, a tube is placed through the abdomen into the stomach. A portion of the stomach contents are drained out after each meal.

Lifestyle and home remediesYour effort to overcome obesity is more likely to be successful if you follow strategies at home along with your formal treatment plan. These can include: Learning about your condition. Education about obesity can help you learn more about why you developed obesity and what you can do about it. You may feel more empowered to take control and stick to your treatment plan. Read reputable self-help books and consider talking about them with your health care professional or therapist. Setting realistic goals. When you have to lose a lot of weight, you may set goals that are unrealistic, such as trying to lose too much too fast. Don't set yourself up for failure. Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss. Make small changes in your diet instead of attempting drastic changes that you're not likely to stick with for the long haul. Sticking to your treatment plan. Changing a lifestyle you may have lived with for many years can be hard to do. Be honest with your doctor, therapist or other health care professionals if you find your activity or eating goals slipping. You can work together to come up with new ideas or new approaches. Enlisting support. Get your family and friends on board with your weight-loss goals. Surround yourself with people who will support you and help you, not sabotage your efforts. Make sure they understand how important weight loss is to your health. You also might want to join a weight-loss support group. Keeping a record. Keep a food and activity log. This record can help you remain accountable for your eating and exercise habits. You can discover things that may be holding you back. You also might see what works well for you. You can use your log to track other important health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels and overall fitness. Alternative medicineMany dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The long-term effectiveness and safety of these products are often questionable. Coping and supportTalk to your health care professional or therapist about improving your coping skills. Consider these tips to cope with obesity and your weight-loss efforts: Journal. Write in a journal to express pain, anger, fear or other emotions. Connect. Don't become isolated. Try to participate in regular activities and get together with family or friends periodically. Join. Join a support group so that you can connect with others facing similar challenges. Focus. Stay focused on your goals. Overcoming obesity is an ongoing process. Stay motivated by keeping your goals in mind. Remind yourself that you're responsible for managing your condition and working toward your goals. Relax. Learn relaxation and stress management. Learning to recognize stress and developing stress management and relaxation skills can help you gain control of unhealthy eating habits. Preparing for your appointmentTalking to your health care professional openly and honestly about your weight concerns is one of the best things you can do for your health. In some cases, you may be referred to an obesity specialist — if one is available in your area. You also may be referred to a behavioral counselor or dietitian. What you can doBeing an active participant in your care is important. One way to do this is by preparing for your appointment. Think about your needs and goals for treatment. Also, write down a list of questions to ask. These questions may include: What eating or activity habits are likely contributing to my health concerns and weight gain? What can I do about the challenges I face in managing my weight? Do I have other health problems that are caused by obesity? Should I see a dietitian? Should I see a behavioral counselor with expertise in weight management? What are the treatment options for obesity and my other health problems? Is weight-loss surgery or another intervention an option for me? Be sure to let your health care team know about any medical conditions you have and about any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you take. What to expect from your doctorDuring your appointment, your health care professional is likely to ask you a number of questions about your weight, eating, activity, mood and thoughts, and any symptoms you might have. You may be asked questions such as: How much did you weigh in high school? What life events may have been associated with weight gain? What, when and how much do you eat in a typical day? How much activity do you get in a typical day? During what periods of your life did you gain weight? What are the factors that you believe affect your weight? How is your daily life affected by your weight? What diets or treatments have you tried to lose weight? What are your weight-loss goals? Are you ready to make changes in your lifestyle to lose weight? What do you think might prevent you from losing weight? What you can do in the meantimeIf you have time before your scheduled appointment, you can get ready for the appointment by keeping a diet diary for two weeks before the appointment. You also can record how many steps you take in a day by using a step counter, called a pedometer. And you can begin to make choices that will help you start to lose weight, including: Making healthy changes in your diet. Include more fruits, vegetables and whole grains in your diet. Begin to reduce portion sizes. Increasing your activity level. Try to get up and move around your home more often. Start gradually if you aren't in good shape or aren't used to exercising. Even a 10-minute daily walk can help. If you have any health conditions or are over a certain age — over 40 for men and over 50 for women — wait until you've talked to your health care professional before you start a new exercise program.

The nonprofit, user-driven online encyclopedia is initially an offshoot of another free encyclopedia project called Nupedia founded by Jimmy Wales. However, Nupedia’s reliance on expert contributors makes progress too slow. Then Wales and Nupedia employee Larry Sanger decide to try a complementary project using wiki technology, which allows anyone to write or edit. The new “Wikipedia” is set up as a non-profit supported by donations and grants with Wales donating the bandwidth and server. By May 2001, Wikipedia expands from English to 13 other languages, including French, Japanese, Hebrew, Russian and Chinese. By the end of the first year, another seven languages are in operation or announced ranging from Arabic to Afrikaans to Polish. NOW Eleven years since its debut, Wikipedia is the fifth highest ranked website in the world, attracting about 475 million unique visitors per month. According to Wikipedia, they have about 82,000 active contributors working on content in 283 languages. Roughly 100 of those have 10,000 or more articles with the latest language to reach the milestone being Singhalese last Thursday. English has the most articles at 3.8 million and the next three most popular languages are German, French, and Dutch. While Wikipedia’s rules state that entries must be on notable subjects, neutral, and verifiable, its collaborative nature, also makes it vulnerable to vandals, propagandists, pranksters, bias, and flame wars, among other hazards, the organization openly acknowledges—particularly for newer articles.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)By AAP6/1/2020Updated: 6/1/2020PrintThe Northern Territory will once again see a rotation of United States Marines despite the COVID-19 pandemic.The first of about 1200 U.S. Marines will arrive in Darwin for joint exercises this week as part of a near decade-long arrangement that has been delayed for two months because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Despite the risk of re-introducing COVID-19 to the Top End, which was declared free of the disease nearly a fortnight ago and not had any locally diagnosed cases for eight weeks, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said in early May the six-month rotation would go ahead.Northern Territory Health Minister Natasha Fyles said strict guidelines had been placed on the rotation with all Marines to quarantine for 14 days on a military base when they arrive in Darwin.“There is a very, very low risk to the community,” she told reporters.Each Marine will be screened four days before departure, screened and tested upon arrival in Australia and at the end of the quarantine period.Rotation numbers had been reduced to 1200 with troops coming in smaller groups during June and July and will stay in Australia until September.The Northern Territory’s last two cases of COVID-19 were two defence force members who contracted it in the Middle East and who flew back to Darwin to recover in hospital.The first U.S. service member to test positive was based in South Korea. He had recovered and was released in mid-April after 49 days in isolation.The 2019 rotation consisted of 2500 U.S. Marines and a range of aircraft and other equipment.By Greg Roberts Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowAAPAuthor FollowAustralian Associated Press is an Australian news agency.Author’s Selected ArticlesMan Fined for Biting Pet Pig During ‘Torturous’ AssaultFeb 14, 2024River Sweep Forms Part of Search for Suspected Victim in VictoriaFeb 14, 2024Communities Still in the Dark After Destructive Storms in QueenslandFeb 14, 2024Man With Gel Blaster Prompts Hospital Lockdown in Gold CoastFeb 13, 2024Related TopicsUnited StatesMarinesNorthern TerritoryCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)By Katabella Roberts2/13/2023Updated: 2/13/2023PrintX 10:00SpaceX founder Elon Musk has defended his company’s decision to limit Ukraine’s use of the company’s Starlink satellite internet service for military purposes, noting that the spacecraft manufacturer and communications company will not actively enable an escalation in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.Musk was responding to former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who called on the Tesla CEO on Feb. 11 to “restore the full functionality” of Starlink satellites, adding that Ukraine “desperately needs your continued support.”“Defense from a genocidal invasion is not an offensive capability. It’s survival. Innocent lives will be lost. You can help. Thank you,” Kelly wrote on Twitter.However, Musk replied that the Starlink satellite communication network is playing a key role in ensuring communication in Ukraine but should not be used for escalation that could lead to a World War.“You’re smart enough not to swallow media and other propaganda bs,” Musk responded. “Starlink is the communication backbone of Ukraine, especially at the front lines, where almost all other Internet connectivity has been destroyed. But we will not enable escalation of conflict that may lead to WW3.”Musk’s response comes after SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said on Feb. 9 that the company was restricting Ukraine’s military from using Starlink to control drones in the region for military purposes against Russia.Shotwell, SpaceX’s chief operating officer, said during a conference in Washington that the company’s Starlink satellite internet service was “never meant to be weaponized,” but that “Ukrainians have leveraged it in ways that were unintentional and not part of any agreement.”Shotwell referenced reports that Ukraine’s military had used the Starlink service to control drones and noted that Ukraine’s agreement with SpaceX was intended for humanitarian purposes such as providing broadband internet to civilians well as hospitals and banks after Russian forced destroyed much of the country’s telecommunications infrastructure.“There are things that we can do to limit their ability to do that,” she said, referring to the reports. “There are things that we can do, and have done.”“We know the military is using them for comms, and that’s ok,” Shotwell added. “But our intent was never to have them use it for offensive purposes.”Ukraine Hits Out at SpaceXFollowing Shotwell’s announcement, Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wrote on Twitter that SpaceX, as well as other companies, needs to decide whether it is “on the side of [Ukraine] and the right to freedom” or on “[Russia’s] side & its ‘right’ to kill & seize territories.”“SpaceX (Starlink) and Mrs. Shotwell should choose a specific option,” Podolyak added.Musk’s SpaceX has been providing internet to Ukraine free of charge through Starlink’s satellite internet service since the early days of the invasion but has stressed that it is designed for peaceful uses only.Despite Shotwell’s recent announcement, some Ukrainian soldiers told The Washington Post that the service is working largely as normal for front-line communications but there have been some reports of issues with terminals attached to strike drones.“We’ve had no issues so far, thank God,” Lt. Oleksandr Matviyenko, the commander of a drone-reconnaissance unit working around Bakhmut, told the publication.The Epoch Times has contacted SpaceX for comment.Reuters contributed to this report.

Although a French name, Michelle is commonly used in English-speaking countries and is a feminine variation of the name Michel.Interestingly, Michel is widely accepted as a French variant and a German diminutive of the name Michael. The masculine name Michael stems from the biblical Hebrew name Mikha’el (מִיכָאֵל), which translates to ‘who is like God.’ The biblical name Michael refers to a prominent archangel alluded to in numerous holy scriptures, including the Hebrew Bible, the Book of Daniel (10:13 and 12:1), the Book of Jude (1:9), and the Book of Revelation (12:7). In each scripture, he is described as both a protector and a fighter against evil spirits. In Christianity, he is also revered as the patron saint of soldiers.In English-speaking countries such as the US, the name Michell came into use in the 20th century. On another note, the most common spelling variations of the name Michell include Michele, Mishel, Mishell, Mishele, and Mishelle. Also, there are a plethora of nicknames that will surely compliment a child named Michell, such as Mich, Chell, Michie, Michy, Mimi, Ell, Mica, and Chelly.Unlike its variant, Michelle, the name Michell is rather uncommon in the realm of fiction. There are currently no known fictional characters by this name, thereby preserving its uniqueness for your little bundle of blessings.Thus, if you’re looking for a feminine name with a sweet resonance that also fosters faith from a young age, Michell could be an excellent choice.Michell Meaning God is not like anyone in this world Gender Girl Religion Judaism Origin Hebrew Lucky Number 8 Syllables Two Length 1 word, 7 letters, 2 vowels, 5 consonants Type Medium length and easy to pronounce How To Pronounce Michell?Pronounced as mi-chellThe way you pronounce a name can make all the difference.Listen to the sound of the name Michell in English.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.Zodiac sign or Sun signThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.Why the date of birth mattersEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.

Friends Read Free(Thinkstock)By Sarah Le8/23/2014Updated: 8/23/2014PrintLOS ANGELES—Imagine transforming the voting process—something considered an almost sacred fundamental right—into something akin to buying a lottery ticket. That’s what the Los Angeles city Ethics Commission would like to do to get more people to come out and vote.Voter turnout is at record lows for Los Angeles city elections. Less than 20 percent of registered voters on average came to the polls in 2013, and less than 10 percent showed up for this month’s special school board election, according to official data.City Ethics Commission President Nathan Hochman said the commission has been looking at many options to encourage people to vote, including penalizing people for not voting. Such a system is used in countries like Australia, where it brings more than 90 percent of people to the polls.But another idea seemed more appealing.“We decided that while sticks are an option, we'd take a look at carrots, incentives,” he said. “One of the incentives that City Council President Herb Wesson was very excited about was the notion of a voter drawing.”After Wesson expressed his interest on Aug. 14, the Los Angeles Ethics Commission voted 3–0 to recommend that the city council consider lottery drawings with cash prizes as an incentive to increase voter turnout. The drawing could be used as soon as LA’s 2015 election.The Ethics Commission proposed using surplus matching funds—which are given to candidates who agree to certain spending restrictions—to fund the lottery. Just one percent of these funds could supply four $25,000 prizes or one hundred $1,000 prizes.But there has been criticism of the idea, too. The LA Times Editorial Board called it “one of the worst ideas we’ve heard in a long time,” noting that it “fails to address the deeper reasons why people don’t vote,” including apathy, ignorance, or critical personal issues.Others are concerned that monetary incentives could skew the outcome of an election by bringing uninformed voters to the polls. But the Ethics Commission says studies show that people who know they are going to vote are more likely to pay attention to the issues.“If we weren’t dealing with a crisis, we wouldn’t be considering any of this,” Hochman said. “For the people who don’t want voter drawings as an answer, we invite you to come up with some other solution that will drive significant more numbers to the polls.”Groups such as the Municipal Elections Reform Commission have suggested that changing the dates of city elections from odd- to even-numbered years to coincide with larger elections would help. They also recommend holding fewer special elections to save time and money for the city and voters. Hochman says these changes could take years.Federal law prohibits paying people to vote, but the Ethics Commission says the federal law would not apply to a purely local election.California and Alaska are the only two states that allow incentives for voting, although the money cannot be used to encourage people to vote for a specific candidate or measure.

Mass Murder Victims During Pandemic | The Epoch TimesOpen sidebarADShare This Article, Friends Read FreeSHAREWorld NewsCanadaMourners Struggle to Grieve N.S. Mass Murder Victims During PandemicFriends Read FreeA memorial is set up across the street from the Debert School, where Lisa McCully, one of the victims of a mass shooting by Gabriel Wortman, taught grades 3 and 4, in Debert, Nova Scotia, Canada, on April 20, 2020. (John Morris/Reuters)By The Canadian Press4/21/2020Updated: 4/21/2020PrintThe death toll from a massacre that stretched across rural Nova Scotia last weekend rose to 23 Tuesday as families grappled with the heart-wrenching question of how to mourn during a pandemic that is forcing people to stay apart.Tammy Oliver-McCurdie, whose sister Jolene Oliver, brother-in-law Aaron Tuck and niece Emily Tuck were among the dead, was struggling with how to plan funerals. The victims have loved ones in both Nova Scotia and Alberta, where the sisters grew up, and the pandemic makes travel difficult.“I don’t know what I’m going to do with this whole COVID thing. It’s just so, so much,” an emotional Oliver-McCurdie said from Red Deer Monday. “I know she’s got people who love her here and people who love her there.”Justin Zahl in Halifax was still searching for answers about his parents’ fate days after seeing images of their Portapique, N.S., home’s burnt remains, all while separated from his younger brother who’s in Albuquerque, N.M. He has no relatives in the province, and the Canada-U.S. border closure is keeping the brothers apart.“I don’t know how I’m going to get my sibling up here,” Zahl said in an interview.Premier Stephen McNeil called the rampage that began Saturday night in the quiet community of Portapique and ended at a gas station in Enfield on Sunday “one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province’s history.”But officials reminded Nova Scotians that the community would have to mourn together from a distance to stop the coronavirus from spreading, as cases and deaths from the illness also climbed.Dr. Robert Strang, the province’s chief medical officer of health, acknowledged at his daily news COVID-19 news conference Monday that it would be “hard for people to hear” reminders about the need for physical distancing in the aftermath of the killings.“COVID-19 is not going to pause because of our pain—we cannot let our guard down,” Strang said.Simon Sherry, a professor in the department of psychology and neuroscience at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said while social and ritualized aspects of grief are important, they represent only one part of coping with death and dying.“At an individual level, people can still make meaning and reach acceptance, even amid a pandemic and the heavy weight of a mass shooting,” he said in an interview Tuesday.On Monday night, people across Nova Scotia were asked to express their grief by stepping outside at 8:30 p.m. to light a candle or shine some kind of light.Others have displayed solidarity by posting photos of sunsets across the province. Toronto-based singing group Choir! Choir! Choir! announced a Facebook live performance of Leonard Cohen’s ‘Hallelujah’ scheduled for Thursday. A virtual vigil is planned for Friday evening, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would attend.Sherry said that kind of new ritual can be an important gesture of solidarity.“When your community, when your province is suffering through grief like this, it’s important to emphasize a connection to community .... It’s important to refocus on community.”A memorial with flowers and tributes sprung up outside the RCMP headquarters in Dartmouth this week to honour Const. Heidi Stevenson, who was killed in the line of duty.But Stevenson’s funeral will look different from those held for slain officers at other points in Canadian history _ like the regimental funeral for Fredericton police constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns in August 2018 that was attended by hundreds of police officers and first responders from across the continent.“It’s going to require some out-of-the-box thinking. I really don’t know where they’re even going to begin,” said Brian Sauve, president of the union representing RCMP officers.He said such events are always uniquely tragic and challenging, but there are possibilities available during the pandemic, such as livestreaming and inviting guests to park along roadways.“There are ways in today’s day and age to honour the fallen,” he said. “It’s just in a different format.”Quentrel Provo, an anti-violence and gun control activist who founded Stop the Violence, Spread the Love in Halifax, led a virtual candlelight vigil Monday night, opening with a prayer, a moment of silence and a reading of victims’ names during a livestream on Facebook.Provo said it was emotionally tough to lead the event, which he set up to offer some hope as Nova Scotians feel overwhelmed by the pandemic and the violence of the weekend.“A lot of tears have been shed. I know myself, I’ve cried a lot in the last few days,” he said in a telephone interview Tuesday.“If we’re hurting, it’s unimaginable the pain the families are going through right now, but we’re trying to come together and be strong and show them support during this time.”Provo said he plans to pay tribute to the victims by lighting a candle each night for the next 20 days, and he said people should continue to support each other and the families into the future.Sherry said people should be careful not to suppress their grief during the pandemic—and it’s important to recognize that people will deal with grief in their own way.“There is no one, particular timeline or course that someone needs to follow as they move through grief, loss and trauma,'' he said.

Credit: Adapted and used with permission from Amgen A new type of targeted immunotherapy drug shrank tumors in about one in three people with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the most aggressive form of lung cancer, according to results from a clinical trial. The findings are encouraging because little progress has been made in treating advanced SCLC, experts said. Many people with SCLC respond to initial treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. But the cancer usually progresses despite additional treatment, with most of these patients dying within weeks or months. The early-stage clinical trial tested two different doses of an experimental drug called tarlatamab in people with SCLC whose cancer had progressed after at least two previous types of treatment. Many people in the study had already received at least three different treatments. In the trial, tumors shrank in 40% of people given 10 mg of tarlatamab every 2 weeks and in about 32% of people who received a 100 mg dose. Furthermore, in more than half of all patients whose tumors shrank with tarlatamab, the treatment kept the cancer at bay for at least 6 months—and in many, it did so for 9 months or longer. This last finding was especially noteworthy, said Anish Thomas, M.D., of NCI’s Center for Cancer Research, who studies SCLC but was not involved in the trial. “This is probably one of the most promising treatments being tested in small cell lung cancer right now,” Dr. Thomas said. The new findings are “hopeful for patients and the people who treat them, especially since this is such an aggressive disease with very few advances in treatment since the 1980s,” he continued. Results of the trial—known as DeLLphi-301 and funded by Amgen, the company that makes tarlatamab—were presented October 20 at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) in Madrid and published the same day in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The new findings “support the use of tarlatamab in these previously treated patients,” said the trial’s senior investigator, Luis Paz-Ares, M.D., Ph.D., of Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre in Madrid, who presented the results at the ESMO meeting. The findings are “encouraging,” agreed Pilar Garrido, M.D., Ph.D., of Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal in Madrid, who spoke about the trial at the ESMO meeting but was not involved in it. However, she noted that patients need to be hospitalized to manage potentially serious side effects when they first receive the drug, which poses logistical challenges to its use. Dr. Garrido also noted the need for more data on the effectiveness of tarlatamab against SCLC that has spread to the brain and for a biomarker that can predict which patients will respond to the drug. According to Dr. Paz-Ares, the manufacturer of tarlatamab has already launched a large clinical trial comparing tarlatamab with standard chemotherapy in people with SCLC that has come back after one initial treatment. Tarlatamab harnesses T cells to destroy small cell lung cancer cells Tarlatamab is a type of immunotherapy known as a bispecific T-cell engager, or BiTE. These two-armed drugs simultaneously latch onto tumor cells and immune cells called T cells. By bringing T cells and cancer cells close together, they help the T cell recognize and destroy the cancer cell. The arm of tarlatamab that targets small cell lung cancer cells attaches to a protein called DLL3. This protein is normally located inside cells but is often present at high levels on the surface of SCLC cells, where it can be recognized by tarlatamab. That makes DLL3 “a very attractive target in SCLC,” Dr. Garrido said. The trial enrolled more than 200 people with advanced, or extensive-stage, SCLC that had progressed or was no longer responding to treatment. All of the participants had previously been treated with chemotherapy, and many had also been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, a different type of immunotherapy drug. All participants had received at least two prior therapies, and one-third had received three or more. The study team analyzed the response to tarlatamab in 100 participants who received 10 mg of tarlatamab by infusion every 2 weeks and another 88 who received 100 mg every 2 weeks. An additional 34 patients on the 10-mg dose were included in the analysis of side effects. The 40% response rate (tumor shrinkage) seen in the 10-mg group “far exceeded” the 15% response rate that has historically been seen in people treated with standard therapies for SCLC that has relapsed, Dr. Paz-Ares and his colleagues wrote in NEJM. Furthermore, 30% of those patients who responded to the drug had responses lasting at least 9 months. That finding is “exciting,” Dr. Thomas said, because the cancer usually grows so rapidly. The median time that people in the 10-mg group lived after starting on tarlatamab was 14.3 months, compared with 6–12 months with current treatments. Researchers are still following the trial participants to learn more about tarlatamab’s side effects and its impact on how long people live. Based on the initial results of DeLLphi-301, the lower (10 mg) dose of tarlatamab will be used in future clinical trials, Dr. Paz-Ares said. Common and potentially serious side effects of tarlatamab The side effects of tarlatamab were generally “manageable,” Dr. Paz-Ares said, and only about 3% of patients in the study stopped treatment entirely because of side effects. In addition, 13% of people in the 10-mg group and 29% in the 100-mg group had to temporarily pause treatment, have their dose reduced, or both, due to side effects. The most common side effect of tarlatamab was cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction in which inflammation spreads throughout the body. Other common side effects included decreased appetite, fever, and anemia. About one-third of the patients experienced severe side effects, including serious cases of cytokine release syndrome. Severe side effects were more frequent in those receiving the higher dose of tarlatamab. Most cases of cytokine release syndrome were “manageable and typically treated with supportive care,” such as intravenous fluids and drugs to control fever and inflammation, Dr. Paz-Ares said. However, one person in the 10-mg group died from respiratory failure resulting from treatment. Another potentially serious side effect of tarlatamab is ICANS (immune effector cell−associated neurotoxicity syndrome), which includes a host of neurological effects such as severe confusion, attention problems, tremor, and muscle weakness. ICANS was more common in patients in the 100-mg treatment group and led one patient in each dose group to stop treatment entirely. Both ICANS and cytokine release syndrome are commonly seen with immunotherapies that activate T cells to kill cancer cells, including other BiTEs and CAR T-cell therapy. Challenges, concerns, and questions remain Dr. Thomas noted that the trial was not designed to compare tarlatamab with standard therapy for SCLC. “But there is strong historical data on how quickly the disease progresses with standard therapy.” Another issue, he said, is that current practice calls for treating all patients with extensive-stage SCLC with chemotherapy plus an immune checkpoint inhibitor at the time of diagnosis. However, about one in four people in the trial had not been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. So it would be good to know how well tarlatamab works specifically for people whose cancer has come back despite previous immunotherapy, he explained. Possible side effects are also a concern. There were few severe cases of cytokine release syndrome in the trial and most occurred after the first or second dose of tarlatamab. Still, the potential risk of side effects with early doses “is an important consideration,” Dr. Thomas said, because patients had to be hospitalized for a couple of days as a precaution when receiving each of the first two or three infusions of tarlatamab. In addition, people had to be in generally good physical condition to participate in the trial, and the impact of potentially serious side effects could be greater in those who are sicker, he continued. For all these reasons, Dr. Thomas said, it will be important to know “how we can best manage side effects such that we don’t need to admit patients to the hospital, and how we can anticipate, prevent, and treat side effects.” He also pointed out that some patients died within 6 weeks after their treatment began, before the study team could assess if the deaths were due to worsening of the cancer. And “we need to better understand whether these early deaths were due to side effects,” he said. Finally, Dr. Garrido said, another challenge is identifying biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to respond to tarlatamab. The research team looked at DLL3 on tumor cells as a potential biomarker, but whether a person responded to the drug did not appear to be linked to having DLL3 in their tumors, the study team reported. “Despite the many challenges,” Dr. Garrido said, the results “offer renewed hope to our patients.” < Older Post Groundbreaking Trial Results Expand Treatment Options for Some People with Bladder Cancer Newer Post > What Comes after NCI-MATCH?

These exams and tests often include: Taking your health history. Your health care team may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, physical activity and exercise habits. You also may talk about your eating patterns and appetite control. Your health care professional may ask about other conditions you've had, medicines you take, your stress levels and other issues about your health. They may also review your family's health history to see if you may be more likely to have certain conditions. A general physical exam. This includes measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen. Calculating your BMI. Your health care professional checks your body mass index, called BMI. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obesity. Numbers higher than 30 increase health risks even more. Have your BMI checked at least once a year. This can help pinpoint your overall health risks and what treatments may be right for you. Measuring your waist size. The distance around your waist is known as the circumference. Fat stored around the waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Women with a waist that measures more than 35 inches (89 centimeters) and men with a waist that's more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) around may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, waist circumference should be checked at least once a year. Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your health care team will evaluate them. Your health care professional also will check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, underactive thyroid, liver problems and diabetes. Gathering this information will help you and your health care team choose the type of treatment that will work best for you. Care at Mayo Clinic Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your obesity-related health concerns Start Here More InformationObesity care at Mayo ClinicCholesterol testLiver function testsBMI and waist circumference calculatorShow more related information TreatmentThe goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. This improves overall health and lowers the risk of developing complications related to obesity. You may need to work with a team of health professionals — including a dietitian, behavioral counselor or an obesity specialist — to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits. The first treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss — 5% to 10% of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms), you'd need to lose only about 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kilograms) for your health to begin to improve. But the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits. All weight-loss programs require that you change your eating habits and get more active. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your weight, your overall health and your willingness to participate in a weight-loss plan. Dietary changesReducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are key to overcoming obesity. Although you may lose weight quickly at first, steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest way to lose weight. It's also the best way to keep weight off permanently. There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include: Cutting calories. The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. The first step is to review your typical eating and drinking habits. You can see how many calories you usually consume and where you can cut back. You and your health care professional can decide how many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight. A typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men. Feeling full on less. Some foods — such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods — contain a lot of calories for a small portion. In contrast, fruits and vegetables provide a larger portion size with fewer calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you can reduce hunger pangs and take in fewer calories. You also may feel better about your meal, which contributes to how satisfied you feel overall. Making healthier choices. To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods. These include fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Also emphasize lean sources of protein — such as beans, lentils and soy — and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week. Limit salt and added sugar. Eat small amounts of fats, and make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils. Restricting certain foods. Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your health care professional which diet plans are effective and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended. Limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories. Meal replacements. These plans suggest replacing one or two meals each day with their products — such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars — and eating healthy snacks. Then you have a healthy, balanced third meal that's low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. But these diets likely won't teach you how to change your overall lifestyle. So you may have to stay on the diet if you want to keep your weight off. Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. But the reality is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, but the long-term results don't appear to be any better than other diets. Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you're likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To lose weight — and keep it off — you must adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over time. Exercise and activityGetting more physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment: Exercise. People with obesity need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity. This can help prevent further weight gain or maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. You'll probably need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve. Keep moving. Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. For example, park farther from store entrances and take the stairs instead of the elevator. A pedometer can track how many steps you take over the course of a day. Many people try to reach 10,000 steps every day. Gradually increase the number of steps you take daily to reach your goal. Behavior changesA behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes to lose weight and keep it off. Steps to take include looking at your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may have contributed to your obesity. Counseling. Talking with a mental health professional can help address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You also can learn how to monitor your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Counseling can be one-on-one or in a group. Support groups. You can find friendship and understanding in support groups where others share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your health care team, local hospitals or commercial weight-loss programs for support groups in your area. Weight-loss medicinesWeight-loss medicines are meant to be used along with diet, exercise and behavior changes, not instead of them. Before selecting a medication for you, your health care professional will consider your health history, as well as possible side effects. The most commonly used medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity include: Bupropion-naltrexone (Contrave). Liraglutide (Saxenda). Orlistat (Alli, Xenical). Phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia). Semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy). Weight-loss medicines may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. When you stop taking a weight-loss medicine, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost. Endoscopic procedures for weight lossThese types of procedures don't require any cuts, also called incisions, in the skin. After you are under anesthesia, flexible tubes and tools are inserted through the mouth and down the throat into the stomach. Common procedures include: Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty. This procedure involves placing stitches in the stomach to reduce the amount of food and liquid the stomach can hold at one time. Over time, eating and drinking less helps the average person lose weight. Intragastric balloon for weight loss. In this procedure, you have a small balloon placed into the stomach. The balloon is then filled with water to reduce the amount of space in the stomach, so you'll feel full eating less food. Intragastric balloons are left in place for up to 6 months and are then removed using an endoscope. At that time, a new balloon may be placed, or not, depending on the plan determined by you and your health care team. Weight-loss surgeryAlso known as bariatric surgery, weight-loss surgery limits how much food you can eat. Some procedures also limit the amount of calories and nutrients you can absorb. But this also can result in nutritional and vitamin deficiencies. Common weight-loss surgeries include: Adjustable gastric banding. In this surgery, an inflatable band placed around the outside of the stomach divides it into two pouches. The surgeon pulls the band tight, like a belt, to create a narrow pathway between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from getting bigger. The band often stays in place permanently. Gastric bypass surgery. In gastric bypass, also called Roux-en-Y (roo-en-wy) gastric bypass, the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into this part of the intestine, bypassing most of the stomach. Gastric sleeve. In this surgery, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food. It's a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. Other treatmentsOther treatments for obesity include: Hydrogels. Available by prescription, these edible capsules contain tiny particles that absorb water and get bigger in the stomach, to help you feel full. The capsules are taken before meals and are passed through the intestines as stool. Vagal nerve blockade. This involves implanting a device under the skin in the stomach area. The device sends electrical pulses to a nerve in that area, called the abdominal vagus nerve. This nerve tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. Gastric aspirate. In this procedure, a tube is placed through the abdomen into the stomach. A portion of the stomach contents are drained out after each meal.

Lifestyle and home remediesYour effort to overcome obesity is more likely to be successful if you follow strategies at home along with your formal treatment plan. These can include: Learning about your condition. Education about obesity can help you learn more about why you developed obesity and what you can do about it. You may feel more empowered to take control and stick to your treatment plan. Read reputable self-help books and consider talking about them with your health care professional or therapist. Setting realistic goals. When you have to lose a lot of weight, you may set goals that are unrealistic, such as trying to lose too much too fast. Don't set yourself up for failure. Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss. Make small changes in your diet instead of attempting drastic changes that you're not likely to stick with for the long haul. Sticking to your treatment plan. Changing a lifestyle you may have lived with for many years can be hard to do. Be honest with your doctor, therapist or other health care professionals if you find your activity or eating goals slipping. You can work together to come up with new ideas or new approaches. Enlisting support. Get your family and friends on board with your weight-loss goals. Surround yourself with people who will support you and help you, not sabotage your efforts. Make sure they understand how important weight loss is to your health. You also might want to join a weight-loss support group. Keeping a record. Keep a food and activity log. This record can help you remain accountable for your eating and exercise habits. You can discover things that may be holding you back. You also might see what works well for you. You can use your log to track other important health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels and overall fitness. Alternative medicineMany dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The long-term effectiveness and safety of these products are often questionable. Coping and supportTalk to your health care professional or therapist about improving your coping skills. Consider these tips to cope with obesity and your weight-loss efforts: Journal. Write in a journal to express pain, anger, fear or other emotions. Connect. Don't become isolated. Try to participate in regular activities and get together with family or friends periodically. Join. Join a support group so that you can connect with others facing similar challenges. Focus. Stay focused on your goals. Overcoming obesity is an ongoing process. Stay motivated by keeping your goals in mind. Remind yourself that you're responsible for managing your condition and working toward your goals. Relax. Learn relaxation and stress management. Learning to recognize stress and developing stress management and relaxation skills can help you gain control of unhealthy eating habits. Preparing for your appointmentTalking to your health care professional openly and honestly about your weight concerns is one of the best things you can do for your health. In some cases, you may be referred to an obesity specialist — if one is available in your area. You also may be referred to a behavioral counselor or dietitian. What you can doBeing an active participant in your care is important. One way to do this is by preparing for your appointment. Think about your needs and goals for treatment. Also, write down a list of questions to ask. These questions may include: What eating or activity habits are likely contributing to my health concerns and weight gain? What can I do about the challenges I face in managing my weight? Do I have other health problems that are caused by obesity? Should I see a dietitian? Should I see a behavioral counselor with expertise in weight management? What are the treatment options for obesity and my other health problems? Is weight-loss surgery or another intervention an option for me? Be sure to let your health care team know about any medical conditions you have and about any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you take. What to expect from your doctorDuring your appointment, your health care professional is likely to ask you a number of questions about your weight, eating, activity, mood and thoughts, and any symptoms you might have. You may be asked questions such as: How much did you weigh in high school? What life events may have been associated with weight gain? What, when and how much do you eat in a typical day? How much activity do you get in a typical day? During what periods of your life did you gain weight? What are the factors that you believe affect your weight? How is your daily life affected by your weight? What diets or treatments have you tried to lose weight? What are your weight-loss goals? Are you ready to make changes in your lifestyle to lose weight? What do you think might prevent you from losing weight? What you can do in the meantimeIf you have time before your scheduled appointment, you can get ready for the appointment by keeping a diet diary for two weeks before the appointment. You also can record how many steps you take in a day by using a step counter, called a pedometer. And you can begin to make choices that will help you start to lose weight, including: Making healthy changes in your diet. Include more fruits, vegetables and whole grains in your diet. Begin to reduce portion sizes. Increasing your activity level. Try to get up and move around your home more often. Start gradually if you aren't in good shape or aren't used to exercising. Even a 10-minute daily walk can help. If you have any health conditions or are over a certain age — over 40 for men and over 50 for women — wait until you've talked to your health care professional before you start a new exercise program.

The nonprofit, user-driven online encyclopedia is initially an offshoot of another free encyclopedia project called Nupedia founded by Jimmy Wales. However, Nupedia’s reliance on expert contributors makes progress too slow. Then Wales and Nupedia employee Larry Sanger decide to try a complementary project using wiki technology, which allows anyone to write or edit. The new “Wikipedia” is set up as a non-profit supported by donations and grants with Wales donating the bandwidth and server. By May 2001, Wikipedia expands from English to 13 other languages, including French, Japanese, Hebrew, Russian and Chinese. By the end of the first year, another seven languages are in operation or announced ranging from Arabic to Afrikaans to Polish. NOW Eleven years since its debut, Wikipedia is the fifth highest ranked website in the world, attracting about 475 million unique visitors per month. According to Wikipedia, they have about 82,000 active contributors working on content in 283 languages. Roughly 100 of those have 10,000 or more articles with the latest language to reach the milestone being Singhalese last Thursday. English has the most articles at 3.8 million and the next three most popular languages are German, French, and Dutch. While Wikipedia’s rules state that entries must be on notable subjects, neutral, and verifiable, its collaborative nature, also makes it vulnerable to vandals, propagandists, pranksters, bias, and flame wars, among other hazards, the organization openly acknowledges—particularly for newer articles.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)By AAP6/1/2020Updated: 6/1/2020PrintThe Northern Territory will once again see a rotation of United States Marines despite the COVID-19 pandemic.The first of about 1200 U.S. Marines will arrive in Darwin for joint exercises this week as part of a near decade-long arrangement that has been delayed for two months because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Despite the risk of re-introducing COVID-19 to the Top End, which was declared free of the disease nearly a fortnight ago and not had any locally diagnosed cases for eight weeks, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said in early May the six-month rotation would go ahead.Northern Territory Health Minister Natasha Fyles said strict guidelines had been placed on the rotation with all Marines to quarantine for 14 days on a military base when they arrive in Darwin.“There is a very, very low risk to the community,” she told reporters.Each Marine will be screened four days before departure, screened and tested upon arrival in Australia and at the end of the quarantine period.Rotation numbers had been reduced to 1200 with troops coming in smaller groups during June and July and will stay in Australia until September.The Northern Territory’s last two cases of COVID-19 were two defence force members who contracted it in the Middle East and who flew back to Darwin to recover in hospital.The first U.S. service member to test positive was based in South Korea. He had recovered and was released in mid-April after 49 days in isolation.The 2019 rotation consisted of 2500 U.S. Marines and a range of aircraft and other equipment.By Greg Roberts Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowAAPAuthor FollowAustralian Associated Press is an Australian news agency.Author’s Selected ArticlesBushfire Evacuees Return to Homes and BusinessesFeb 15, 2024Warrant Issued for Man Charged Over Deepfake ImagesFeb 15, 2024Psychic ‘Held the Beauty’ as Man Died at Health RetreatFeb 15, 2024Man Fined for Biting Pet Pig During ‘Torturous’ AssaultFeb 14, 2024Related TopicsUnited StatesMarinesNorthern TerritoryCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

For example, if you want it messy but still put together to wear to work, use a silk pillowcase, and if you want an extra messy just-left-the-beach look, then you should sleep on a cotton or fabric pillowcase.”11.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)By Katabella Roberts2/13/2023Updated: 2/13/2023PrintX 10:00SpaceX founder Elon Musk has defended his company’s decision to limit Ukraine’s use of the company’s Starlink satellite internet service for military purposes, noting that the spacecraft manufacturer and communications company will not actively enable an escalation in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.Musk was responding to former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who called on the Tesla CEO on Feb. 11 to “restore the full functionality” of Starlink satellites, adding that Ukraine “desperately needs your continued support.”“Defense from a genocidal invasion is not an offensive capability. It’s survival. Innocent lives will be lost. You can help. Thank you,” Kelly wrote on Twitter.However, Musk replied that the Starlink satellite communication network is playing a key role in ensuring communication in Ukraine but should not be used for escalation that could lead to a World War.“You’re smart enough not to swallow media and other propaganda bs,” Musk responded. “Starlink is the communication backbone of Ukraine, especially at the front lines, where almost all other Internet connectivity has been destroyed. But we will not enable escalation of conflict that may lead to WW3.”Musk’s response comes after SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said on Feb. 9 that the company was restricting Ukraine’s military from using Starlink to control drones in the region for military purposes against Russia.Shotwell, SpaceX’s chief operating officer, said during a conference in Washington that the company’s Starlink satellite internet service was “never meant to be weaponized,” but that “Ukrainians have leveraged it in ways that were unintentional and not part of any agreement.”Shotwell referenced reports that Ukraine’s military had used the Starlink service to control drones and noted that Ukraine’s agreement with SpaceX was intended for humanitarian purposes such as providing broadband internet to civilians well as hospitals and banks after Russian forced destroyed much of the country’s telecommunications infrastructure.“There are things that we can do to limit their ability to do that,” she said, referring to the reports. “There are things that we can do, and have done.”“We know the military is using them for comms, and that’s ok,” Shotwell added. “But our intent was never to have them use it for offensive purposes.”Ukraine Hits Out at SpaceXFollowing Shotwell’s announcement, Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wrote on Twitter that SpaceX, as well as other companies, needs to decide whether it is “on the side of [Ukraine] and the right to freedom” or on “[Russia’s] side & its ‘right’ to kill & seize territories.”“SpaceX (Starlink) and Mrs. Shotwell should choose a specific option,” Podolyak added.Musk’s SpaceX has been providing internet to Ukraine free of charge through Starlink’s satellite internet service since the early days of the invasion but has stressed that it is designed for peaceful uses only.Despite Shotwell’s recent announcement, some Ukrainian soldiers told The Washington Post that the service is working largely as normal for front-line communications but there have been some reports of issues with terminals attached to strike drones.“We’ve had no issues so far, thank God,” Lt. Oleksandr Matviyenko, the commander of a drone-reconnaissance unit working around Bakhmut, told the publication.The Epoch Times has contacted SpaceX for comment.Reuters contributed to this report.

15-02-2024 18:28,https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/tarlatamab-previously-treated-sclc,"Tarlatamab for Previously Treated Small Cell Lung Cancer - NCI Skip to main content An official website of the United States government Español Menu Search Search About Cancer Cancer Types Research Grants & Training News & Events About NCI Home News & Events Cancer Currents Blog Tarlatamab Shows Promise for Some People with Small Cell Lung Cancer Print Email Tarlatamab Shows Promise for Some People with Small Cell Lung Cancer Subscribe December 1, 2023, by Elia Ben-Ari Tarlatamab is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE), a two-armed drug that simultaneously latches onto tumor cells and T cells, bringing them close together and helping the T cells recognize and destroy cancer cells. Credit: Adapted and used with permission from Amgen A new type of targeted immunotherapy drug shrank tumors in about one in three people with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the most aggressive form of lung cancer, according to results from a clinical trial. The findings are encouraging because little progress has been made in treating advanced SCLC, experts said. Many people with SCLC respond to initial treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. But the cancer usually progresses despite additional treatment, with most of these patients dying within weeks or months. The early-stage clinical trial tested two different doses of an experimental drug called tarlatamab in people with SCLC whose cancer had progressed after at least two previous types of treatment. Many people in the study had already received at least three different treatments. In the trial, tumors shrank in 40% of people given 10 mg of tarlatamab every 2 weeks and in about 32% of people who received a 100 mg dose. Furthermore, in more than half of all patients whose tumors shrank with tarlatamab, the treatment kept the cancer at bay for at least 6 months—and in many, it did so for 9 months or longer. This last finding was especially noteworthy, said Anish Thomas, M.D., of NCI’s Center for Cancer Research, who studies SCLC but was not involved in the trial. “This is probably one of the most promising treatments being tested in small cell lung cancer right now,” Dr. Thomas said. The new findings are “hopeful for patients and the people who treat them, especially since this is such an aggressive disease with very few advances in treatment since the 1980s,” he continued. Results of the trial—known as DeLLphi-301 and funded by Amgen, the company that makes tarlatamab—were presented October 20 at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) in Madrid and published the same day in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The new findings “support the use of tarlatamab in these previously treated patients,” said the trial’s senior investigator, Luis Paz-Ares, M.D., Ph.D., of Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre in Madrid, who presented the results at the ESMO meeting. The findings are “encouraging,” agreed Pilar Garrido, M.D., Ph.D., of Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal in Madrid, who spoke about the trial at the ESMO meeting but was not involved in it. However, she noted that patients need to be hospitalized to manage potentially serious side effects when they first receive the drug, which poses logistical challenges to its use. Dr. Garrido also noted the need for more data on the effectiveness of tarlatamab against SCLC that has spread to the brain and for a biomarker that can predict which patients will respond to the drug. According to Dr. Paz-Ares, the manufacturer of tarlatamab has already launched a large clinical trial comparing tarlatamab with standard chemotherapy in people with SCLC that has come back after one initial treatment. Tarlatamab harnesses T cells to destroy small cell lung cancer cells Tarlatamab is a type of immunotherapy known as a bispecific T-cell engager, or BiTE. These two-armed drugs simultaneously latch onto tumor cells and immune cells called T cells. By bringing T cells and cancer cells close together, they help the T cell recognize and destroy the cancer cell. The arm of tarlatamab that targets small cell lung cancer cells attaches to a protein called DLL3. This protein is normally located inside cells but is often present at high levels on the surface of SCLC cells, where it can be recognized by tarlatamab. That makes DLL3 “a very attractive target in SCLC,” Dr. Garrido said. The trial enrolled more than 200 people with advanced, or extensive-stage, SCLC that had progressed or was no longer responding to treatment. All of the participants had previously been treated with chemotherapy, and many had also been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, a different type of immunotherapy drug. All participants had received at least two prior therapies, and one-third had received three or more. The study team analyzed the response to tarlatamab in 100 participants who received 10 mg of tarlatamab by infusion every 2 weeks and another 88 who received 100 mg every 2 weeks. An additional 34 patients on the 10-mg dose were included in the analysis of side effects. The 40% response rate (tumor shrinkage) seen in the 10-mg group “far exceeded” the 15% response rate that has historically been seen in people treated with standard therapies for SCLC that has relapsed, Dr. Paz-Ares and his colleagues wrote in NEJM. Furthermore, 30% of those patients who responded to the drug had responses lasting at least 9 months. That finding is “exciting,” Dr. Thomas said, because the cancer usually grows so rapidly. The median time that people in the 10-mg group lived after starting on tarlatamab was 14.3 months, compared with 6–12 months with current treatments. Researchers are still following the trial participants to learn more about tarlatamab’s side effects and its impact on how long people live. Based on the initial results of DeLLphi-301, the lower (10 mg) dose of tarlatamab will be used in future clinical trials, Dr. Paz-Ares said. Common and potentially serious side effects of tarlatamab The side effects of tarlatamab were generally “manageable,” Dr. Paz-Ares said, and only about 3% of patients in the study stopped treatment entirely because of side effects. In addition, 13% of people in the 10-mg group and 29% in the 100-mg group had to temporarily pause treatment, have their dose reduced, or both, due to side effects. The most common side effect of tarlatamab was cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction in which inflammation spreads throughout the body. Other common side effects included decreased appetite, fever, and anemia. About one-third of the patients experienced severe side effects, including serious cases of cytokine release syndrome. Severe side effects were more frequent in those receiving the higher dose of tarlatamab. Most cases of cytokine release syndrome were “manageable and typically treated with supportive care,” such as intravenous fluids and drugs to control fever and inflammation, Dr. Paz-Ares said. However, one person in the 10-mg group died from respiratory failure resulting from treatment. Another potentially serious side effect of tarlatamab is ICANS (immune effector cell−associated neurotoxicity syndrome), which includes a host of neurological effects such as severe confusion, attention problems, tremor, and muscle weakness. ICANS was more common in patients in the 100-mg treatment group and led one patient in each dose group to stop treatment entirely. Both ICANS and cytokine release syndrome are commonly seen with immunotherapies that activate T cells to kill cancer cells, including other BiTEs and CAR T-cell therapy. Challenges, concerns, and questions remain Dr. Thomas noted that the trial was not designed to compare tarlatamab with standard therapy for SCLC. “But there is strong historical data on how quickly the disease progresses with standard therapy.” Another issue, he said, is that current practice calls for treating all patients with extensive-stage SCLC with chemotherapy plus an immune checkpoint inhibitor at the time of diagnosis. However, about one in four people in the trial had not been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. So it would be good to know how well tarlatamab works specifically for people whose cancer has come back despite previous immunotherapy, he explained. Possible side effects are also a concern. There were few severe cases of cytokine release syndrome in the trial and most occurred after the first or second dose of tarlatamab. Still, the potential risk of side effects with early doses “is an important consideration,” Dr. Thomas said, because patients had to be hospitalized for a couple of days as a precaution when receiving each of the first two or three infusions of tarlatamab. In addition, people had to be in generally good physical condition to participate in the trial, and the impact of potentially serious side effects could be greater in those who are sicker, he continued. For all these reasons, Dr. Thomas said, it will be important to know “how we can best manage side effects such that we don’t need to admit patients to the hospital, and how we can anticipate, prevent, and treat side effects.” He also pointed out that some patients died within 6 weeks after their treatment began, before the study team could assess if the deaths were due to worsening of the cancer. And “we need to better understand whether these early deaths were due to side effects,” he said. Finally, Dr. Garrido said, another challenge is identifying biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to respond to tarlatamab. The research team looked at DLL3 on tumor cells as a potential biomarker, but whether a person responded to the drug did not appear to be linked to having DLL3 in their tumors, the study team reported. “Despite the many challenges,” Dr. Garrido said, the results “offer renewed hope to our patients.” < Older Post Groundbreaking Trial Results Expand Treatment Options for Some People with Bladder Cancer Newer Post > What Comes after NCI-MATCH?

These exams and tests often include: Taking your health history. Your health care team may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, physical activity and exercise habits. You also may talk about your eating patterns and appetite control. Your health care professional may ask about other conditions you've had, medicines you take, your stress levels and other issues about your health. They may also review your family's health history to see if you may be more likely to have certain conditions. A general physical exam. This includes measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen. Calculating your BMI. Your health care professional checks your body mass index, called BMI. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obesity. Numbers higher than 30 increase health risks even more. Have your BMI checked at least once a year. This can help pinpoint your overall health risks and what treatments may be right for you. Measuring your waist size. The distance around your waist is known as the circumference. Fat stored around the waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Women with a waist that measures more than 35 inches (89 centimeters) and men with a waist that's more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) around may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, waist circumference should be checked at least once a year. Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your health care team will evaluate them. Your health care professional also will check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, underactive thyroid, liver problems and diabetes. Gathering this information will help you and your health care team choose the type of treatment that will work best for you. Care at Mayo Clinic Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your obesity-related health concerns Start Here More InformationObesity care at Mayo ClinicCholesterol testLiver function testsBMI and waist circumference calculatorShow more related information TreatmentThe goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. This improves overall health and lowers the risk of developing complications related to obesity. You may need to work with a team of health professionals — including a dietitian, behavioral counselor or an obesity specialist — to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits. The first treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss — 5% to 10% of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms), you'd need to lose only about 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kilograms) for your health to begin to improve. But the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits. All weight-loss programs require that you change your eating habits and get more active. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your weight, your overall health and your willingness to participate in a weight-loss plan. Dietary changesReducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are key to overcoming obesity. Although you may lose weight quickly at first, steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest way to lose weight. It's also the best way to keep weight off permanently. There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include: Cutting calories. The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. The first step is to review your typical eating and drinking habits. You can see how many calories you usually consume and where you can cut back. You and your health care professional can decide how many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight. A typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men. Feeling full on less. Some foods — such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods — contain a lot of calories for a small portion. In contrast, fruits and vegetables provide a larger portion size with fewer calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you can reduce hunger pangs and take in fewer calories. You also may feel better about your meal, which contributes to how satisfied you feel overall. Making healthier choices. To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods. These include fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Also emphasize lean sources of protein — such as beans, lentils and soy — and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week. Limit salt and added sugar. Eat small amounts of fats, and make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils. Restricting certain foods. Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your health care professional which diet plans are effective and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended. Limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories. Meal replacements. These plans suggest replacing one or two meals each day with their products — such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars — and eating healthy snacks. Then you have a healthy, balanced third meal that's low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. But these diets likely won't teach you how to change your overall lifestyle. So you may have to stay on the diet if you want to keep your weight off. Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. But the reality is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, but the long-term results don't appear to be any better than other diets. Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you're likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To lose weight — and keep it off — you must adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over time. Exercise and activityGetting more physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment: Exercise. People with obesity need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity. This can help prevent further weight gain or maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. You'll probably need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve. Keep moving. Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. For example, park farther from store entrances and take the stairs instead of the elevator. A pedometer can track how many steps you take over the course of a day. Many people try to reach 10,000 steps every day. Gradually increase the number of steps you take daily to reach your goal. Behavior changesA behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes to lose weight and keep it off. Steps to take include looking at your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may have contributed to your obesity. Counseling. Talking with a mental health professional can help address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You also can learn how to monitor your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Counseling can be one-on-one or in a group. Support groups. You can find friendship and understanding in support groups where others share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your health care team, local hospitals or commercial weight-loss programs for support groups in your area. Weight-loss medicinesWeight-loss medicines are meant to be used along with diet, exercise and behavior changes, not instead of them. Before selecting a medication for you, your health care professional will consider your health history, as well as possible side effects. The most commonly used medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity include: Bupropion-naltrexone (Contrave). Liraglutide (Saxenda). Orlistat (Alli, Xenical). Phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia). Semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy). Weight-loss medicines may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. When you stop taking a weight-loss medicine, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost. Endoscopic procedures for weight lossThese types of procedures don't require any cuts, also called incisions, in the skin. After you are under anesthesia, flexible tubes and tools are inserted through the mouth and down the throat into the stomach. Common procedures include: Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty. This procedure involves placing stitches in the stomach to reduce the amount of food and liquid the stomach can hold at one time. Over time, eating and drinking less helps the average person lose weight. Intragastric balloon for weight loss. In this procedure, you have a small balloon placed into the stomach. The balloon is then filled with water to reduce the amount of space in the stomach, so you'll feel full eating less food. Intragastric balloons are left in place for up to 6 months and are then removed using an endoscope. At that time, a new balloon may be placed, or not, depending on the plan determined by you and your health care team. Weight-loss surgeryAlso known as bariatric surgery, weight-loss surgery limits how much food you can eat. Some procedures also limit the amount of calories and nutrients you can absorb. But this also can result in nutritional and vitamin deficiencies. Common weight-loss surgeries include: Adjustable gastric banding. In this surgery, an inflatable band placed around the outside of the stomach divides it into two pouches. The surgeon pulls the band tight, like a belt, to create a narrow pathway between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from getting bigger. The band often stays in place permanently. Gastric bypass surgery. In gastric bypass, also called Roux-en-Y (roo-en-wy) gastric bypass, the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into this part of the intestine, bypassing most of the stomach. Gastric sleeve. In this surgery, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food. It's a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. Other treatmentsOther treatments for obesity include: Hydrogels. Available by prescription, these edible capsules contain tiny particles that absorb water and get bigger in the stomach, to help you feel full. The capsules are taken before meals and are passed through the intestines as stool. Vagal nerve blockade. This involves implanting a device under the skin in the stomach area. The device sends electrical pulses to a nerve in that area, called the abdominal vagus nerve. This nerve tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. Gastric aspirate. In this procedure, a tube is placed through the abdomen into the stomach. A portion of the stomach contents are drained out after each meal.

Lifestyle and home remediesYour effort to overcome obesity is more likely to be successful if you follow strategies at home along with your formal treatment plan. These can include: Learning about your condition. Education about obesity can help you learn more about why you developed obesity and what you can do about it. You may feel more empowered to take control and stick to your treatment plan. Read reputable self-help books and consider talking about them with your health care professional or therapist. Setting realistic goals. When you have to lose a lot of weight, you may set goals that are unrealistic, such as trying to lose too much too fast. Don't set yourself up for failure. Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss. Make small changes in your diet instead of attempting drastic changes that you're not likely to stick with for the long haul. Sticking to your treatment plan. Changing a lifestyle you may have lived with for many years can be hard to do. Be honest with your doctor, therapist or other health care professionals if you find your activity or eating goals slipping. You can work together to come up with new ideas or new approaches. Enlisting support. Get your family and friends on board with your weight-loss goals. Surround yourself with people who will support you and help you, not sabotage your efforts. Make sure they understand how important weight loss is to your health. You also might want to join a weight-loss support group. Keeping a record. Keep a food and activity log. This record can help you remain accountable for your eating and exercise habits. You can discover things that may be holding you back. You also might see what works well for you. You can use your log to track other important health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels and overall fitness. Alternative medicineMany dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The long-term effectiveness and safety of these products are often questionable. Coping and supportTalk to your health care professional or therapist about improving your coping skills. Consider these tips to cope with obesity and your weight-loss efforts: Journal. Write in a journal to express pain, anger, fear or other emotions. Connect. Don't become isolated. Try to participate in regular activities and get together with family or friends periodically. Join. Join a support group so that you can connect with others facing similar challenges. Focus. Stay focused on your goals. Overcoming obesity is an ongoing process. Stay motivated by keeping your goals in mind. Remind yourself that you're responsible for managing your condition and working toward your goals. Relax. Learn relaxation and stress management. Learning to recognize stress and developing stress management and relaxation skills can help you gain control of unhealthy eating habits. Preparing for your appointmentTalking to your health care professional openly and honestly about your weight concerns is one of the best things you can do for your health. In some cases, you may be referred to an obesity specialist — if one is available in your area. You also may be referred to a behavioral counselor or dietitian. What you can doBeing an active participant in your care is important. One way to do this is by preparing for your appointment. Think about your needs and goals for treatment. Also, write down a list of questions to ask. These questions may include: What eating or activity habits are likely contributing to my health concerns and weight gain? What can I do about the challenges I face in managing my weight? Do I have other health problems that are caused by obesity? Should I see a dietitian? Should I see a behavioral counselor with expertise in weight management? What are the treatment options for obesity and my other health problems? Is weight-loss surgery or another intervention an option for me? Be sure to let your health care team know about any medical conditions you have and about any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you take. What to expect from your doctorDuring your appointment, your health care professional is likely to ask you a number of questions about your weight, eating, activity, mood and thoughts, and any symptoms you might have. You may be asked questions such as: How much did you weigh in high school? What life events may have been associated with weight gain? What, when and how much do you eat in a typical day? How much activity do you get in a typical day? During what periods of your life did you gain weight? What are the factors that you believe affect your weight? How is your daily life affected by your weight? What diets or treatments have you tried to lose weight? What are your weight-loss goals? Are you ready to make changes in your lifestyle to lose weight? What do you think might prevent you from losing weight? What you can do in the meantimeIf you have time before your scheduled appointment, you can get ready for the appointment by keeping a diet diary for two weeks before the appointment. You also can record how many steps you take in a day by using a step counter, called a pedometer. And you can begin to make choices that will help you start to lose weight, including: Making healthy changes in your diet. Include more fruits, vegetables and whole grains in your diet. Begin to reduce portion sizes. Increasing your activity level. Try to get up and move around your home more often. Start gradually if you aren't in good shape or aren't used to exercising. Even a 10-minute daily walk can help. If you have any health conditions or are over a certain age — over 40 for men and over 50 for women — wait until you've talked to your health care professional before you start a new exercise program.

The nonprofit, user-driven online encyclopedia is initially an offshoot of another free encyclopedia project called Nupedia founded by Jimmy Wales. However, Nupedia’s reliance on expert contributors makes progress too slow. Then Wales and Nupedia employee Larry Sanger decide to try a complementary project using wiki technology, which allows anyone to write or edit. The new “Wikipedia” is set up as a non-profit supported by donations and grants with Wales donating the bandwidth and server. By May 2001, Wikipedia expands from English to 13 other languages, including French, Japanese, Hebrew, Russian and Chinese. By the end of the first year, another seven languages are in operation or announced ranging from Arabic to Afrikaans to Polish. NOW Eleven years since its debut, Wikipedia is the fifth highest ranked website in the world, attracting about 475 million unique visitors per month. According to Wikipedia, they have about 82,000 active contributors working on content in 283 languages. Roughly 100 of those have 10,000 or more articles with the latest language to reach the milestone being Singhalese last Thursday. English has the most articles at 3.8 million and the next three most popular languages are German, French, and Dutch. While Wikipedia’s rules state that entries must be on notable subjects, neutral, and verifiable, its collaborative nature, also makes it vulnerable to vandals, propagandists, pranksters, bias, and flame wars, among other hazards, the organization openly acknowledges—particularly for newer articles.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)By Katabella Roberts2/13/2023Updated: 2/13/2023PrintX 10:00SpaceX founder Elon Musk has defended his company’s decision to limit Ukraine’s use of the company’s Starlink satellite internet service for military purposes, noting that the spacecraft manufacturer and communications company will not actively enable an escalation in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.Musk was responding to former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who called on the Tesla CEO on Feb. 11 to “restore the full functionality” of Starlink satellites, adding that Ukraine “desperately needs your continued support.”“Defense from a genocidal invasion is not an offensive capability. It’s survival. Innocent lives will be lost. You can help. Thank you,” Kelly wrote on Twitter.However, Musk replied that the Starlink satellite communication network is playing a key role in ensuring communication in Ukraine but should not be used for escalation that could lead to a World War.“You’re smart enough not to swallow media and other propaganda bs,” Musk responded. “Starlink is the communication backbone of Ukraine, especially at the front lines, where almost all other Internet connectivity has been destroyed. But we will not enable escalation of conflict that may lead to WW3.”Musk’s response comes after SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said on Feb. 9 that the company was restricting Ukraine’s military from using Starlink to control drones in the region for military purposes against Russia.Shotwell, SpaceX’s chief operating officer, said during a conference in Washington that the company’s Starlink satellite internet service was “never meant to be weaponized,” but that “Ukrainians have leveraged it in ways that were unintentional and not part of any agreement.”Shotwell referenced reports that Ukraine’s military had used the Starlink service to control drones and noted that Ukraine’s agreement with SpaceX was intended for humanitarian purposes such as providing broadband internet to civilians well as hospitals and banks after Russian forced destroyed much of the country’s telecommunications infrastructure.“There are things that we can do to limit their ability to do that,” she said, referring to the reports. “There are things that we can do, and have done.”“We know the military is using them for comms, and that’s ok,” Shotwell added. “But our intent was never to have them use it for offensive purposes.”Ukraine Hits Out at SpaceXFollowing Shotwell’s announcement, Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wrote on Twitter that SpaceX, as well as other companies, needs to decide whether it is “on the side of [Ukraine] and the right to freedom” or on “[Russia’s] side & its ‘right’ to kill & seize territories.”“SpaceX (Starlink) and Mrs. Shotwell should choose a specific option,” Podolyak added.Musk’s SpaceX has been providing internet to Ukraine free of charge through Starlink’s satellite internet service since the early days of the invasion but has stressed that it is designed for peaceful uses only.Despite Shotwell’s recent announcement, some Ukrainian soldiers told The Washington Post that the service is working largely as normal for front-line communications but there have been some reports of issues with terminals attached to strike drones.“We’ve had no issues so far, thank God,” Lt. Oleksandr Matviyenko, the commander of a drone-reconnaissance unit working around Bakhmut, told the publication.The Epoch Times has contacted SpaceX for comment.Reuters contributed to this report.

Credit: Adapted and used with permission from Amgen A new type of targeted immunotherapy drug shrank tumors in about one in three people with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the most aggressive form of lung cancer, according to results from a clinical trial. The findings are encouraging because little progress has been made in treating advanced SCLC, experts said. Many people with SCLC respond to initial treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. But the cancer usually progresses despite additional treatment, with most of these patients dying within weeks or months. The early-stage clinical trial tested two different doses of an experimental drug called tarlatamab in people with SCLC whose cancer had progressed after at least two previous types of treatment. Many people in the study had already received at least three different treatments. In the trial, tumors shrank in 40% of people given 10 mg of tarlatamab every 2 weeks and in about 32% of people who received a 100 mg dose. Furthermore, in more than half of all patients whose tumors shrank with tarlatamab, the treatment kept the cancer at bay for at least 6 months—and in many, it did so for 9 months or longer. This last finding was especially noteworthy, said Anish Thomas, M.D., of NCI’s Center for Cancer Research, who studies SCLC but was not involved in the trial. “This is probably one of the most promising treatments being tested in small cell lung cancer right now,” Dr. Thomas said. The new findings are “hopeful for patients and the people who treat them, especially since this is such an aggressive disease with very few advances in treatment since the 1980s,” he continued. Results of the trial—known as DeLLphi-301 and funded by Amgen, the company that makes tarlatamab—were presented October 20 at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) in Madrid and published the same day in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The new findings “support the use of tarlatamab in these previously treated patients,” said the trial’s senior investigator, Luis Paz-Ares, M.D., Ph.D., of Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre in Madrid, who presented the results at the ESMO meeting. The findings are “encouraging,” agreed Pilar Garrido, M.D., Ph.D., of Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal in Madrid, who spoke about the trial at the ESMO meeting but was not involved in it. However, she noted that patients need to be hospitalized to manage potentially serious side effects when they first receive the drug, which poses logistical challenges to its use. Dr. Garrido also noted the need for more data on the effectiveness of tarlatamab against SCLC that has spread to the brain and for a biomarker that can predict which patients will respond to the drug. According to Dr. Paz-Ares, the manufacturer of tarlatamab has already launched a large clinical trial comparing tarlatamab with standard chemotherapy in people with SCLC that has come back after one initial treatment. Tarlatamab harnesses T cells to destroy small cell lung cancer cells Tarlatamab is a type of immunotherapy known as a bispecific T-cell engager, or BiTE. These two-armed drugs simultaneously latch onto tumor cells and immune cells called T cells. By bringing T cells and cancer cells close together, they help the T cell recognize and destroy the cancer cell. The arm of tarlatamab that targets small cell lung cancer cells attaches to a protein called DLL3. This protein is normally located inside cells but is often present at high levels on the surface of SCLC cells, where it can be recognized by tarlatamab. That makes DLL3 “a very attractive target in SCLC,” Dr. Garrido said. The trial enrolled more than 200 people with advanced, or extensive-stage, SCLC that had progressed or was no longer responding to treatment. All of the participants had previously been treated with chemotherapy, and many had also been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, a different type of immunotherapy drug. All participants had received at least two prior therapies, and one-third had received three or more. The study team analyzed the response to tarlatamab in 100 participants who received 10 mg of tarlatamab by infusion every 2 weeks and another 88 who received 100 mg every 2 weeks. An additional 34 patients on the 10-mg dose were included in the analysis of side effects. The 40% response rate (tumor shrinkage) seen in the 10-mg group “far exceeded” the 15% response rate that has historically been seen in people treated with standard therapies for SCLC that has relapsed, Dr. Paz-Ares and his colleagues wrote in NEJM. Furthermore, 30% of those patients who responded to the drug had responses lasting at least 9 months. That finding is “exciting,” Dr. Thomas said, because the cancer usually grows so rapidly. The median time that people in the 10-mg group lived after starting on tarlatamab was 14.3 months, compared with 6–12 months with current treatments. Researchers are still following the trial participants to learn more about tarlatamab’s side effects and its impact on how long people live. Based on the initial results of DeLLphi-301, the lower (10 mg) dose of tarlatamab will be used in future clinical trials, Dr. Paz-Ares said. Common and potentially serious side effects of tarlatamab The side effects of tarlatamab were generally “manageable,” Dr. Paz-Ares said, and only about 3% of patients in the study stopped treatment entirely because of side effects. In addition, 13% of people in the 10-mg group and 29% in the 100-mg group had to temporarily pause treatment, have their dose reduced, or both, due to side effects. The most common side effect of tarlatamab was cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction in which inflammation spreads throughout the body. Other common side effects included decreased appetite, fever, and anemia. About one-third of the patients experienced severe side effects, including serious cases of cytokine release syndrome. Severe side effects were more frequent in those receiving the higher dose of tarlatamab. Most cases of cytokine release syndrome were “manageable and typically treated with supportive care,” such as intravenous fluids and drugs to control fever and inflammation, Dr. Paz-Ares said. However, one person in the 10-mg group died from respiratory failure resulting from treatment. Another potentially serious side effect of tarlatamab is ICANS (immune effector cell−associated neurotoxicity syndrome), which includes a host of neurological effects such as severe confusion, attention problems, tremor, and muscle weakness. ICANS was more common in patients in the 100-mg treatment group and led one patient in each dose group to stop treatment entirely. Both ICANS and cytokine release syndrome are commonly seen with immunotherapies that activate T cells to kill cancer cells, including other BiTEs and CAR T-cell therapy. Challenges, concerns, and questions remain Dr. Thomas noted that the trial was not designed to compare tarlatamab with standard therapy for SCLC. “But there is strong historical data on how quickly the disease progresses with standard therapy.” Another issue, he said, is that current practice calls for treating all patients with extensive-stage SCLC with chemotherapy plus an immune checkpoint inhibitor at the time of diagnosis. However, about one in four people in the trial had not been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. So it would be good to know how well tarlatamab works specifically for people whose cancer has come back despite previous immunotherapy, he explained. Possible side effects are also a concern. There were few severe cases of cytokine release syndrome in the trial and most occurred after the first or second dose of tarlatamab. Still, the potential risk of side effects with early doses “is an important consideration,” Dr. Thomas said, because patients had to be hospitalized for a couple of days as a precaution when receiving each of the first two or three infusions of tarlatamab. In addition, people had to be in generally good physical condition to participate in the trial, and the impact of potentially serious side effects could be greater in those who are sicker, he continued. For all these reasons, Dr. Thomas said, it will be important to know “how we can best manage side effects such that we don’t need to admit patients to the hospital, and how we can anticipate, prevent, and treat side effects.” He also pointed out that some patients died within 6 weeks after their treatment began, before the study team could assess if the deaths were due to worsening of the cancer. And “we need to better understand whether these early deaths were due to side effects,” he said. Finally, Dr. Garrido said, another challenge is identifying biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to respond to tarlatamab. The research team looked at DLL3 on tumor cells as a potential biomarker, but whether a person responded to the drug did not appear to be linked to having DLL3 in their tumors, the study team reported. “Despite the many challenges,” Dr. Garrido said, the results “offer renewed hope to our patients.” < Older Post Groundbreaking Trial Results Expand Treatment Options for Some People with Bladder Cancer Newer Post > What Comes after NCI-MATCH?

These exams and tests often include: Taking your health history. Your health care team may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, physical activity and exercise habits. You also may talk about your eating patterns and appetite control. Your health care professional may ask about other conditions you've had, medicines you take, your stress levels and other issues about your health. They may also review your family's health history to see if you may be more likely to have certain conditions. A general physical exam. This includes measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen. Calculating your BMI. Your health care professional checks your body mass index, called BMI. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obesity. Numbers higher than 30 increase health risks even more. Have your BMI checked at least once a year. This can help pinpoint your overall health risks and what treatments may be right for you. Measuring your waist size. The distance around your waist is known as the circumference. Fat stored around the waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Women with a waist that measures more than 35 inches (89 centimeters) and men with a waist that's more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) around may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, waist circumference should be checked at least once a year. Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your health care team will evaluate them. Your health care professional also will check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, underactive thyroid, liver problems and diabetes. Gathering this information will help you and your health care team choose the type of treatment that will work best for you. Care at Mayo Clinic Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your obesity-related health concerns Start Here More InformationObesity care at Mayo ClinicCholesterol testLiver function testsBMI and waist circumference calculatorShow more related information TreatmentThe goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. This improves overall health and lowers the risk of developing complications related to obesity. You may need to work with a team of health professionals — including a dietitian, behavioral counselor or an obesity specialist — to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits. The first treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss — 5% to 10% of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms), you'd need to lose only about 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kilograms) for your health to begin to improve. But the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits. All weight-loss programs require that you change your eating habits and get more active. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your weight, your overall health and your willingness to participate in a weight-loss plan. Dietary changesReducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are key to overcoming obesity. Although you may lose weight quickly at first, steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest way to lose weight. It's also the best way to keep weight off permanently. There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include: Cutting calories. The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. The first step is to review your typical eating and drinking habits. You can see how many calories you usually consume and where you can cut back. You and your health care professional can decide how many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight. A typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men. Feeling full on less. Some foods — such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods — contain a lot of calories for a small portion. In contrast, fruits and vegetables provide a larger portion size with fewer calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you can reduce hunger pangs and take in fewer calories. You also may feel better about your meal, which contributes to how satisfied you feel overall. Making healthier choices. To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods. These include fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Also emphasize lean sources of protein — such as beans, lentils and soy — and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week. Limit salt and added sugar. Eat small amounts of fats, and make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils. Restricting certain foods. Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your health care professional which diet plans are effective and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended. Limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories. Meal replacements. These plans suggest replacing one or two meals each day with their products — such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars — and eating healthy snacks. Then you have a healthy, balanced third meal that's low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. But these diets likely won't teach you how to change your overall lifestyle. So you may have to stay on the diet if you want to keep your weight off. Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. But the reality is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, but the long-term results don't appear to be any better than other diets. Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you're likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To lose weight — and keep it off — you must adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over time. Exercise and activityGetting more physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment: Exercise. People with obesity need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity. This can help prevent further weight gain or maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. You'll probably need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve. Keep moving. Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. For example, park farther from store entrances and take the stairs instead of the elevator. A pedometer can track how many steps you take over the course of a day. Many people try to reach 10,000 steps every day. Gradually increase the number of steps you take daily to reach your goal. Behavior changesA behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes to lose weight and keep it off. Steps to take include looking at your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may have contributed to your obesity. Counseling. Talking with a mental health professional can help address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You also can learn how to monitor your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Counseling can be one-on-one or in a group. Support groups. You can find friendship and understanding in support groups where others share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your health care team, local hospitals or commercial weight-loss programs for support groups in your area. Weight-loss medicinesWeight-loss medicines are meant to be used along with diet, exercise and behavior changes, not instead of them. Before selecting a medication for you, your health care professional will consider your health history, as well as possible side effects. The most commonly used medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity include: Bupropion-naltrexone (Contrave). Liraglutide (Saxenda). Orlistat (Alli, Xenical). Phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia). Semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy). Weight-loss medicines may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. When you stop taking a weight-loss medicine, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost. Endoscopic procedures for weight lossThese types of procedures don't require any cuts, also called incisions, in the skin. After you are under anesthesia, flexible tubes and tools are inserted through the mouth and down the throat into the stomach. Common procedures include: Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty. This procedure involves placing stitches in the stomach to reduce the amount of food and liquid the stomach can hold at one time. Over time, eating and drinking less helps the average person lose weight. Intragastric balloon for weight loss. In this procedure, you have a small balloon placed into the stomach. The balloon is then filled with water to reduce the amount of space in the stomach, so you'll feel full eating less food. Intragastric balloons are left in place for up to 6 months and are then removed using an endoscope. At that time, a new balloon may be placed, or not, depending on the plan determined by you and your health care team. Weight-loss surgeryAlso known as bariatric surgery, weight-loss surgery limits how much food you can eat. Some procedures also limit the amount of calories and nutrients you can absorb. But this also can result in nutritional and vitamin deficiencies. Common weight-loss surgeries include: Adjustable gastric banding. In this surgery, an inflatable band placed around the outside of the stomach divides it into two pouches. The surgeon pulls the band tight, like a belt, to create a narrow pathway between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from getting bigger. The band often stays in place permanently. Gastric bypass surgery. In gastric bypass, also called Roux-en-Y (roo-en-wy) gastric bypass, the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into this part of the intestine, bypassing most of the stomach. Gastric sleeve. In this surgery, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food. It's a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. Other treatmentsOther treatments for obesity include: Hydrogels. Available by prescription, these edible capsules contain tiny particles that absorb water and get bigger in the stomach, to help you feel full. The capsules are taken before meals and are passed through the intestines as stool. Vagal nerve blockade. This involves implanting a device under the skin in the stomach area. The device sends electrical pulses to a nerve in that area, called the abdominal vagus nerve. This nerve tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. Gastric aspirate. In this procedure, a tube is placed through the abdomen into the stomach. A portion of the stomach contents are drained out after each meal.

Lifestyle and home remediesYour effort to overcome obesity is more likely to be successful if you follow strategies at home along with your formal treatment plan. These can include: Learning about your condition. Education about obesity can help you learn more about why you developed obesity and what you can do about it. You may feel more empowered to take control and stick to your treatment plan. Read reputable self-help books and consider talking about them with your health care professional or therapist. Setting realistic goals. When you have to lose a lot of weight, you may set goals that are unrealistic, such as trying to lose too much too fast. Don't set yourself up for failure. Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss. Make small changes in your diet instead of attempting drastic changes that you're not likely to stick with for the long haul. Sticking to your treatment plan. Changing a lifestyle you may have lived with for many years can be hard to do. Be honest with your doctor, therapist or other health care professionals if you find your activity or eating goals slipping. You can work together to come up with new ideas or new approaches. Enlisting support. Get your family and friends on board with your weight-loss goals. Surround yourself with people who will support you and help you, not sabotage your efforts. Make sure they understand how important weight loss is to your health. You also might want to join a weight-loss support group. Keeping a record. Keep a food and activity log. This record can help you remain accountable for your eating and exercise habits. You can discover things that may be holding you back. You also might see what works well for you. You can use your log to track other important health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels and overall fitness. Alternative medicineMany dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The long-term effectiveness and safety of these products are often questionable. Coping and supportTalk to your health care professional or therapist about improving your coping skills. Consider these tips to cope with obesity and your weight-loss efforts: Journal. Write in a journal to express pain, anger, fear or other emotions. Connect. Don't become isolated. Try to participate in regular activities and get together with family or friends periodically. Join. Join a support group so that you can connect with others facing similar challenges. Focus. Stay focused on your goals. Overcoming obesity is an ongoing process. Stay motivated by keeping your goals in mind. Remind yourself that you're responsible for managing your condition and working toward your goals. Relax. Learn relaxation and stress management. Learning to recognize stress and developing stress management and relaxation skills can help you gain control of unhealthy eating habits. Preparing for your appointmentTalking to your health care professional openly and honestly about your weight concerns is one of the best things you can do for your health. In some cases, you may be referred to an obesity specialist — if one is available in your area. You also may be referred to a behavioral counselor or dietitian. What you can doBeing an active participant in your care is important. One way to do this is by preparing for your appointment. Think about your needs and goals for treatment. Also, write down a list of questions to ask. These questions may include: What eating or activity habits are likely contributing to my health concerns and weight gain? What can I do about the challenges I face in managing my weight? Do I have other health problems that are caused by obesity? Should I see a dietitian? Should I see a behavioral counselor with expertise in weight management? What are the treatment options for obesity and my other health problems? Is weight-loss surgery or another intervention an option for me? Be sure to let your health care team know about any medical conditions you have and about any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you take. What to expect from your doctorDuring your appointment, your health care professional is likely to ask you a number of questions about your weight, eating, activity, mood and thoughts, and any symptoms you might have. You may be asked questions such as: How much did you weigh in high school? What life events may have been associated with weight gain? What, when and how much do you eat in a typical day? How much activity do you get in a typical day? During what periods of your life did you gain weight? What are the factors that you believe affect your weight? How is your daily life affected by your weight? What diets or treatments have you tried to lose weight? What are your weight-loss goals? Are you ready to make changes in your lifestyle to lose weight? What do you think might prevent you from losing weight? What you can do in the meantimeIf you have time before your scheduled appointment, you can get ready for the appointment by keeping a diet diary for two weeks before the appointment. You also can record how many steps you take in a day by using a step counter, called a pedometer. And you can begin to make choices that will help you start to lose weight, including: Making healthy changes in your diet. Include more fruits, vegetables and whole grains in your diet. Begin to reduce portion sizes. Increasing your activity level. Try to get up and move around your home more often. Start gradually if you aren't in good shape or aren't used to exercising. Even a 10-minute daily walk can help. If you have any health conditions or are over a certain age — over 40 for men and over 50 for women — wait until you've talked to your health care professional before you start a new exercise program.

The nonprofit, user-driven online encyclopedia is initially an offshoot of another free encyclopedia project called Nupedia founded by Jimmy Wales. However, Nupedia’s reliance on expert contributors makes progress too slow. Then Wales and Nupedia employee Larry Sanger decide to try a complementary project using wiki technology, which allows anyone to write or edit. The new “Wikipedia” is set up as a non-profit supported by donations and grants with Wales donating the bandwidth and server. By May 2001, Wikipedia expands from English to 13 other languages, including French, Japanese, Hebrew, Russian and Chinese. By the end of the first year, another seven languages are in operation or announced ranging from Arabic to Afrikaans to Polish. NOW Eleven years since its debut, Wikipedia is the fifth highest ranked website in the world, attracting about 475 million unique visitors per month. According to Wikipedia, they have about 82,000 active contributors working on content in 283 languages. Roughly 100 of those have 10,000 or more articles with the latest language to reach the milestone being Singhalese last Thursday. English has the most articles at 3.8 million and the next three most popular languages are German, French, and Dutch. While Wikipedia’s rules state that entries must be on notable subjects, neutral, and verifiable, its collaborative nature, also makes it vulnerable to vandals, propagandists, pranksters, bias, and flame wars, among other hazards, the organization openly acknowledges—particularly for newer articles.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)By AAP6/1/2020Updated: 6/1/2020PrintThe Northern Territory will once again see a rotation of United States Marines despite the COVID-19 pandemic.The first of about 1200 U.S. Marines will arrive in Darwin for joint exercises this week as part of a near decade-long arrangement that has been delayed for two months because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Despite the risk of re-introducing COVID-19 to the Top End, which was declared free of the disease nearly a fortnight ago and not had any locally diagnosed cases for eight weeks, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said in early May the six-month rotation would go ahead.Northern Territory Health Minister Natasha Fyles said strict guidelines had been placed on the rotation with all Marines to quarantine for 14 days on a military base when they arrive in Darwin.“There is a very, very low risk to the community,” she told reporters.Each Marine will be screened four days before departure, screened and tested upon arrival in Australia and at the end of the quarantine period.Rotation numbers had been reduced to 1200 with troops coming in smaller groups during June and July and will stay in Australia until September.The Northern Territory’s last two cases of COVID-19 were two defence force members who contracted it in the Middle East and who flew back to Darwin to recover in hospital.The first U.S. service member to test positive was based in South Korea. He had recovered and was released in mid-April after 49 days in isolation.The 2019 rotation consisted of 2500 U.S. Marines and a range of aircraft and other equipment.By Greg Roberts Friends Read FreeCopyCommentsWrite a comment...CommentsShare it nowAAPAuthor FollowAustralian Associated Press is an Australian news agency.Author’s Selected ArticlesBushfire Evacuees Return to Homes and BusinessesFeb 15, 2024Warrant Issued for Man Charged Over Deepfake ImagesFeb 15, 2024Psychic ‘Held the Beauty’ as Man Died at Health RetreatFeb 15, 2024Man Fined for Biting Pet Pig During ‘Torturous’ AssaultFeb 14, 2024Related TopicsUnited StatesMarinesNorthern TerritoryCommentsWrite a comment...Copyright © 2000 - 2024 The Epoch Times Association Inc.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)By Katabella Roberts2/13/2023Updated: 2/13/2023PrintX 10:00SpaceX founder Elon Musk has defended his company’s decision to limit Ukraine’s use of the company’s Starlink satellite internet service for military purposes, noting that the spacecraft manufacturer and communications company will not actively enable an escalation in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.Musk was responding to former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who called on the Tesla CEO on Feb. 11 to “restore the full functionality” of Starlink satellites, adding that Ukraine “desperately needs your continued support.”“Defense from a genocidal invasion is not an offensive capability. It’s survival. Innocent lives will be lost. You can help. Thank you,” Kelly wrote on Twitter.However, Musk replied that the Starlink satellite communication network is playing a key role in ensuring communication in Ukraine but should not be used for escalation that could lead to a World War.“You’re smart enough not to swallow media and other propaganda bs,” Musk responded. “Starlink is the communication backbone of Ukraine, especially at the front lines, where almost all other Internet connectivity has been destroyed. But we will not enable escalation of conflict that may lead to WW3.”Musk’s response comes after SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said on Feb. 9 that the company was restricting Ukraine’s military from using Starlink to control drones in the region for military purposes against Russia.Shotwell, SpaceX’s chief operating officer, said during a conference in Washington that the company’s Starlink satellite internet service was “never meant to be weaponized,” but that “Ukrainians have leveraged it in ways that were unintentional and not part of any agreement.”Shotwell referenced reports that Ukraine’s military had used the Starlink service to control drones and noted that Ukraine’s agreement with SpaceX was intended for humanitarian purposes such as providing broadband internet to civilians well as hospitals and banks after Russian forced destroyed much of the country’s telecommunications infrastructure.“There are things that we can do to limit their ability to do that,” she said, referring to the reports. “There are things that we can do, and have done.”“We know the military is using them for comms, and that’s ok,” Shotwell added. “But our intent was never to have them use it for offensive purposes.”Ukraine Hits Out at SpaceXFollowing Shotwell’s announcement, Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wrote on Twitter that SpaceX, as well as other companies, needs to decide whether it is “on the side of [Ukraine] and the right to freedom” or on “[Russia’s] side & its ‘right’ to kill & seize territories.”“SpaceX (Starlink) and Mrs. Shotwell should choose a specific option,” Podolyak added.Musk’s SpaceX has been providing internet to Ukraine free of charge through Starlink’s satellite internet service since the early days of the invasion but has stressed that it is designed for peaceful uses only.Despite Shotwell’s recent announcement, some Ukrainian soldiers told The Washington Post that the service is working largely as normal for front-line communications but there have been some reports of issues with terminals attached to strike drones.“We’ve had no issues so far, thank God,” Lt. Oleksandr Matviyenko, the commander of a drone-reconnaissance unit working around Bakhmut, told the publication.The Epoch Times has contacted SpaceX for comment.Reuters contributed to this report.
