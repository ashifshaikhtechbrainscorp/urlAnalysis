Sufferers have trouble getting to sleep with arthritis, as well as staying asleep, waking early, and the sleep tends to be lighter, restless and unrefreshing.As people get older, they tend to spend more of their sleep time in the lighter phases of sleep, which means they are more likely to be disrupted by the pain and discomfort of arthritis. While the pain of arthritis is a factor in poor sleep, it is not the only cause.Getting a Better SleepIn fact, research has shown pain killers are not necessarily the answer to disturbed sleep. For some reason, insomnia and arthritis often just co-exist. Medications given for arthritis may also be making sleep difficult. Cortisone, for example, can cause insomnia and, while some painkillers may make you drowsy, they may make you fall asleep during the day, which can then make it difficult to fall asleep at night.Whatever the cause, improving sleep is important. Research indicates that the sleep deprivation amplifies the pain of arthritis and a bad night’s sleep is linked to worse arthritis pain the next day. The deep stages of sleep are also when the body releases hormones to repair muscle damaged during the day. Disrupted sleep can also affects other aspects of life, causing fatigue, thinking problems, difficulty concentrating, poor memory, headaches and disturbed mood.Related Search Topics Back Arthritis Pain ReliefBack Pain Relief ArthritisRA TreatmentsRheumatoid Arthritis Treatments You May Also LikeHow Losing Excess Weight Can Help ArthritisArthritis CopingHow Losing Excess Weight Can Help Arthritis9 years ago| by Meredith CrowhurstWhile losing excess weight can be challenging with arthritis, it can be achieved with a proper diet and safe, gentle exercise to improve symptoms.While sleep medications can assist, they do have side effects. They also do not address the underlying causes for the sleep disturbance, which can lead to reliance on the sleep medication. Lifestyle modification and non-medication therapies have been shown to help.Some habits that can assist with sleep are:Avoid caffeine, in tea, coffee and soft drinks, especially after middayAvoid eating a large meal within three hours of bedtimeAvoid nicotine before bedtimeAvoid alcohol before bed, as it might make you sleepy but the quality of sleep is worseAvoid exercise three hours before bedtimeAvoid napping during the dayCreate a relaxing bedtime routine, going to bed and getting up at the same time every dayKeep the bedroom dark, cool and quietAvoid watching television, using your phone or tablet, or working in the bedroomTry taking a bath before bedIf you can’t fall asleep, after 20 minutes get up and go back to bed when you feel sleepyGet adequate light exposure during the dayIt may help to create a sleep diary, recording your sleep patterns and what factors have helped and hindered you getting to sleep and staying asleep. Using a fitness tracker with a sleep recording device may also help you to understand better the quality of the sleep you are getting.If medication is keeping you awake, you might also need to talk to your doctor about altering your medications or the time of day you take them.Therapies to Help Get a Better SleepThere are some specific therapies shown to help with sleep:Yoga – involves stretching, strengthening, balancing, breathing exercises and meditation. Yoga may help with sleep by reducing joint stiffness and promoting relaxation.Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) – involves training the mind to change from negative unhelpful thinking to more positive useful thought patterns. Examples include changing the bedtime routine and counteracting negative thoughts in the evening. CBT is taught by psychologists and there are also online courses where you can learn techniques.Relaxation techniques – relaxation exercises include deep breathing, controlled and timed breathing, mindfulness meditation, tai chi, and activities that focus the mind in the present. Relaxation can help calm the mind prior to bed. It can also help relax any stiff and aching muscles.Daily exercise – gentle daily exercise can help. It can make you feel more fatigued at the end of the day, which can help with sleepiness. 20 minutes every day is good and can be spaced in two 10-minute segments. Low-impact exercises, such as walking, cycling or water aerobics are good.Medication - if sleep is very difficult, there may be a role for medication. Doctors may prescribe painkillers, anti-inflammatory medications, sedatives, or certain antidepressants that can have sedative effects. The type of medication will likely depend on the precise reason you are having trouble sleeping and must also take into consideration other medications you might be on.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsArthritis SymptomsArthritis and Fatigue: Is My Arthritis Making Me Tired?BlogWhat Is the Difference Between Osteoporosis and Rheumatoid Arthritis?BlogThe Best and Worst Foods to Eat for People With Rheumatoid ArthritisBlogWhat Is Degenerative Arthritis?BlogGluten-Free Diet for Arthritis: 4 Foods That Can Help With InflammationArthritis SymptomsArthritis and Your Skin: How Does Arthritis Affect Your Skin?you may also likeArthritis CopingThe Gout Diet: 7 Foods to Eat With GoutArthritis Coping10 Exercises to Help Carpal Tunnel SymptomsArthritis CopingBeing a Young Person With Rheumatoid ArthritisArthritis Coping10 Ways to Relieve Arthritis Painconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

2024-02-20 18:27:51,http://arthritisliving.today/arthritis-coping/stress-and-arthritis/,"The Link Between Stress and Arthritis - ArthritisLiving.today ArthritisLiving.todayMenuArthritis SymptomsArthritis CopingBlogSearchSearch The Relationship Between Stress and ArthritisFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail9 years ago| by Eric Patterson Photo Credit: OcusFocus / iStockphoto.comStress and ArthritisThink back to life around the time when your arthritis symptoms began. What was going on? How did you feel? Were there any major life changes going on? How was your stress?Now, think back to a recent time when you had a lot of stress. How were your arthritis symptoms? Did you notice any changes? Were they for the better or the worse?After you answered these questions, you probably began to uncover the relationship between stress and arthritis. Many people report the onset of their symptoms come immediately after a major life event or after an intensely stressful time. They also report that once the symptoms are established, they increase their levels of perceived stress. Things that would normally be easier to manage become major barriers or obstacles to overcome because of arthritis pain.The relationship between stress and arthritis is clear, and it is bidirectional. This means that stress can spark or worsen arthritis while arthritis can trigger or worsen stress. Experts in the field are constantly looking for ways to explain the link.Currently, they have two ideas regarding the biological explanation for the link, which each has to do with the body’s response to stress. The targets are called cytokines and cortisol. Cytokines are a category of proteins released by cells. Some cytokines are related to inflammation associated with arthritis. Cortisol is a hormone that is released during periods of stress that inhibits the body’s ability to repair cell damage.Stress/Arthritis SolutionsIn this case, the question remains: What can I do to improve my arthritis so that my stress is lower, and how do I lower my stress to improve my arthritis? The answer is a long one that is broken into two parts. Part one is to take care of your arthritis. Part two is to take care of your stress. Focusing on one or the other can result in you being overwhelmed and burned out, though. Because your time, efforts, and resources are limited, it is advantageous to seek out solutions that efficiently manage both steps simultaneously. Here’s how:The Big ThreeWith your physical health, there is nothing more important than the combination of sleep, diet, and exercise. When stress or arthritis are present, modifying one or all of these factors can lead to tremendously beneficial results. Having the right amount of sleep for you; an improved diet based on lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables; and increased, low-impact physical activity will make a positive difference in your mental health and physical health.You may think that increased physical activity will increase your arthritis pain, but reconsider this faulty notion. Consult your physician to find the recommended form of exercise for your level of pain. Swimming, walking, yoga or elliptical trainers could give you the profits of exercise without the pain. Overall, exercise is shown to reduce joint pain with consistent use. Studies also show exercise to be associated with the release of stress-reducing chemicals into the brain.Related Search Topics Back Arthritis Pain ReliefBack Pain Relief ArthritisTreatment Rheumatoid ArthritisRA And Gout Foot Pain You May Also Like5 Knee Arthritis Exercises Worth Trying to Help Relieve PainArthritis Coping5 Knee Arthritis Exercises Worth Trying to Help Relieve Pain6 years ago| by Katrina HodginsThere are many low-impact knee arthritis exercises which can help improve range in motion and flexibility, options include water aerobics, yoga, and more.Eating well helps you to feel well both mentally and physically. For your physical health, be sure to evade known foods that result in inflammation or increase discomfort. Ask your doctor to list foods you should avoid while you maintain a food journal to track poor food choices specific to your body. When you eat for energy rather than enjoyment, your body and mind reward you with a heightened ability to manage daily stress.With sleep, the evidence is everywhere. Sleeping helps your body and your mind reset and recuperate after a long day. Be aware, though. More sleep is not necessarily better. Investigate your sleep patterns to determine if your trends need to be shortened or extended. Experiment with different lengths of sleep gradually to ease your body through the process.Relaxation TechniquesIf stress is a concern in your life, relaxation techniques are a viable solution. Techniques come in many variations with near-endless options for customization. For your stress and arthritis, there is a version perfect for you. An added layer of benefit is that most relaxation techniques work to strengthen the body as well as the mind.Begin with a simple deep breathing technique. Diaphragmatic breathing means that you are using your diaphragm to inhale in a deeper way that increases the volume of air in your lungs. Increased air available floods your blood much-needed oxygen to feed your organs. When oxygen is sufficient, your heart can slow, which calms your entire being. If deep breathing has been a struggle, begin with the exhale. Push out all of the air from your lungs, pause, and then suck in as much air as your can to fill low in your lungs. Leave your shoulders still, and push out your stomach.Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is another relaxation technique that yields a two-fold value. By tensing and relaxing your muscles, you can stretch and move your joints in a way that relieves pain. To complete PMR, tense muscles in a part of your body by squeezing your hands into fists or squinting you eyes and forehead. Target the sources of your physical stress. After holding and feeling the tension, relax the muscles and feel the tension melt away. Experiment with different methods of tension in different locations to explore all the PMR has to offer.Find AcceptanceEvery day, people have added stress and discomfort in their life due to lack of acceptance of their current state. Yes. You can manage arthritis symptoms, and you can reduce your stress, but there is little chance that either will be completely eradicated. Because of this, you need to find acceptance.Bringing acceptance into your life does not mean that you are giving up or ending your battle with arthritis or stress. It does mean that you understand the influence that these issues present to your life. Acceptance helps to change your expectations of yourself and your world to be more practical and realistic. Some days you are going to be in pain. Some days your stress will be high. Denying these facts only amplify the unwanted effects.ConclusionArthritis and stress are painful in a literal and figurative way. Do not expend your energies inefficiently by trying to improve each individual. Working on the tips above will simultaneously lessen your physical pain and mental anguish while improving your overall well-being. By changing your life, the only risk is feeling better. Start feeling better today.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsBlog8 Common Misconceptions About ArthritisArthritis SymptomsCan Arthritis Cause Chest Pain?Arthritis SymptomsWhat Are the Common Triggers for Arthritis Flare-Ups?BlogThe Causes and Symptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis, and How to Treat ItArthritis Symptoms8 Warning Signs of OsteoarthritisBlogStiff, Painful Shoulder?

For some people, it hits early and follows a distinct pattern of pain, swelling and stiffness, but others struggle for years with misdiagnoses and ineffective treatments.In any case, RA is more than just a joint problem, and it warrants a different plan of attack than other types of arthritis. Don’t wait for your body to break down to call your doctor – if you notice any of these suspicious symptoms, consult with a rheumatologist to check for RA and to learn about the health complications of rheumatoid arthritis.1. FatigueFeeling sleepy is one thing, but an exhaustion that’s difficult to overcome is another issue altogether. Fatigue is one of the first signs that your autoimmune response is kicking into overdrive, and it can last for weeks or months before any other symptoms begin to pop up.You may also notice a feeling of general malaise, and that physical discomfort can turn into an emotional burden. When does fatigue demand a visit to the doctor? If it goes on for more than two weeks, despite your efforts to get more rest and reduce stress, it’s time investigate further.NextRelated Search Topics Pain Medication For RAStages Of Rheumatoid ArthritisPain Medication RASevere RA Treatment Options You May Also LikeThe Connection Between Arthritis and GeneticsArthritis SymptomsThe Connection Between Arthritis and Genetics4 years ago| by Sheree McDonaldIs arthritis hereditary?

You’ve likely heard of carpal tunnel before but may not realize why it develops and what can be done.Let’s take a look at the 10 common signs of carpal tunnel, when to see a doctor, how it’s treated, and how you can help prevent this condition.What Is Carpal Tunnel?Carpal tunnel syndrome is a medical condition that causes numbness, tingling and other symptoms in the hand and arm. This condition develops when a nerve is compressed in the carpal tunnel, which is a narrow passageway leading to your wrist (on the palm side). This nerve is called the median nerve.Some people seem to have a higher risk of carpal tunnel, possibly due to the anatomy of the wrist. When you perform repetitive tasks using one hand or wrist, this can put excess pressure on the median nerve. This creates pressure causing symptoms like tingling and numbness in the hand and arm. The pain can travel up the forearm, even to the shoulder and elsewhere.Causes of carpal tunnel include:Repetitive motions especially if your hands are lower than your wrist.Conditions like diabetes, obesity, hypothyroidism, obesity, and rheumatoid arthritisPregnancyIn fact, there is is no single cause. A combination of factors likely leads to developing this condition.Anything that squeezes or irritates the median nerve may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. A wrist fracture, for example, can narrow the carpal tunnel and irritate the nerve. The inflammation and swelling from rheumatoid arthritis can also contribute.One thing is certain, women are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. Researchers believe this is because the carpal tunnel area is smaller in women than it is in men. And some women have smaller carpal tunnels than others do.Working conditions are often to blame. Along with typing, working with vibrating tools - or doing a repetitive motion on an assembly line – can create the harmful pressure that irritates the median nerve or worsens nerve damage.Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel SyndromeLet’s take a close look at the signs and symptoms of this medical condition:1. Tingling or NumbnessThe first symptoms can be very subtle – a slight numbness or tingling in your fingertips or hands. Interestingly, the pinky finger very often is not affected. The tingling may feel very unusual, possibly like an electric shock.You might feel this tingling when you hold an object – your phone, the steering wheel, or a pen. You might even wake up at night feeling the tingling. Your first instinct might be to shake your hands to stop the tingling.2. WeaknessIf your hands have started feeling weak – and you have trouble holding objects – you might have carpal tunnel syndrome. Have you started dropping things? The hand numbness might cause this, or it’s because muscles in your thumb are affected. The median nerve controls the thumb.Most people don’t realize this condition doesn’t just cause tingling and pain. It can also make holding onto things a lot harder. You can even lose your ability to do everyday things like open a milk bottle or grip the steering wheel of your car.3. Nighttime SymptomsSome people feel their first symptoms at night when they bend wrists while asleep. This bending motion puts pressure on the median nerve, which can be very tingly or painful.Your first reaction might be to shake your wrists in an attempt to short-circuit the sensation. If this is happening frequently, talk to your doctor. At that point it’s probably carpal tunnel – and not some weird occurrence. Get treatment early before it gets worse.4. Feeling of Swollen FingersIf your fingers feel swollen – but they look fine – it might be carpal tunnel. This feeling can be very strange because it makes no sense. To look at your fingers, they don’t look any different from usual. Yet they feel larger, very swollen.You may think soaking your hands in hot water will help them feel better, but this won’t help. This feeling of swollen fingers is very typical in cases of advanced carpal tunnel syndrome.Related Search Topics Fibromyalgia and RA TreatmentsBack Pain Relief ArthritisRA TreatmentsRheumatoid Arthritis Treatments You May Also LikeWhat Are the 10 Most Common Types of Arthritis?Arthritis SymptomsWhat Are the 10 Most Common Types of Arthritis?5 years ago| by Katrina HodginsIf you suspect arthritis is the source of your pain the first step is a diagnosis. Here are 10 of the most common types of arthritis to watch out for.5. Pain and Tingling Traveling Up the ForearmThe feeling of numbness, pain, and tingling can extend beyond your fingers and hands. Your forearm might get affected – as well as your shoulder. This radiating pain can be very uncomfortable, but it’s generally carpal tunnel – not something worse. Many people have reported this type of sensation.6. Electric ShocksA feeling of “electric shock” is often described among carpal tunnel symptoms. You might experience this feeling occasionally through your fingers. This can be disturbing as people with other conditions like multiple sclerosis also report similar sensations -- much like tingling and numbness.It’s important to find out what exactly is causing these symptoms, to make sure you know whether it’s carpal tunnel syndrome or another serious disease.7. Difficulty Holding Small ObjectsIf you can’t easily hold your toothbrush, use your keys, or handle a pen, you might have carpal tunnel syndrome. Very often, dexterity and flexibility with small objects is very limited. You can work with big objects the same as before, but they might fall while you’re carrying them.8. Making a Fist is DifficultIf you’ve ever slept on your hand in a strange position, you know that it’s hard to make a fist after you wake up. Or if you’ve been biking a long distance, your hands can feel nearly paralyzed, useless. You couldn’t make a fist if you tried. Your impulse is to “shake out” your fingers to loosen them.That’s the feeling when you have carpal tunnel syndrome. It’s very frustrating and embarrassing when you can’t make a fist – as it affects your ability to do everyday things like grip a milk carton or a package, or even hold onto the car’s steering wheel.9. Can’t Sleep Due to Wrist PainIf the wrist pain is so bad that you can’t sleep at night, carpal tunnel syndrome may be at work. You might have thought that carpal tunnel was just tingling and numbness, but as the condition worsens, there can be severe pain. Because the wrist is a sensitive area, you can have a difficult time sleeping – or focusing on your work during the day.10. Clumsy MovesEveryday activities can be difficult when you have carpal tunnel, including cooking, driving, even washing your face. That’s because fine motor skills have been affected. But there’s even more going on. You may not be able to tell where your hand is in relation to objects.This is a condition called proprioception, and it can be very embarrassing, making you feel clumsy. You might set a glass down just short of a table, so there’s a mess. It’s like your eyes and hands are playing tricks on you -- but it’s really just an odd symptom of carpal tunnel.Prevention of Carpal Tunnel SyndromeTo help prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, you can minimize stress on your hands and wrists. A few tips:Relax your grip whenever possible. If your job involves a keyboard or a cash register, hit the keys as softly as possible. If you write for lengthy periods, use a big pen with a soft grip adapter and free-flowing ink.Take frequent breaks. Stretch and bend your hands and wrists periodically. Do something different for a while, especially if you’re using equipment that vibrates.Protect your wrist. Don’t bend your wrist all the way up or down. Keep your wrist in a relaxed middle position. Your keyboard should be at elbow height or slightly lower.Improve your posture. If you sit incorrectly, your shoulders can roll forward. This shortens your neck and shoulder muscles and compresses the nerves in your neck. All this pressure will affect your wrists, fingers, and hands.Change your computer mouse. Don’t strain your wrist while working with your mouse; make sure it’s in a comfortable position.Keep your hands warm. If you work in a warm (vs. cold) environment, you’re less likely to develop hand pain and stiffness. Fingerless gloves will keep your hands and wrists warm.Carpal tunnel syndrome at work is a serious matter. In some settings, it may be necessary to redesign workstations to ensure that the worker's wrist is in a natural position during work. Supervisors should also make sure that jobs are rotated among workers whenever possible.When to See a Doctor for Carpal TunnelWhen you can’t sleep because of the pain in your hand, wrist or forearm, it is time to see a specialist. You need to find out the cause, whether it is carpal tunnel or another medical problem.If your symptoms occur occasionally, they might not be related to carpal tunnel. Most people have had a hand that “falls asleep”, for example. However, when it happens often, you should talk to your doctor.If you do have carpal tunnel syndrome and don't get treatment, the symptoms can get worse. In some cases, they may disappear for a while, then return.Bottom line is – with early diagnosis, the treatment is easier. With proper treatment, the tingling, numbness and other symptoms can resolve. You can regain your wrist and hand function.ResourcesVeryHealthy.com (10 Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel)WebMD (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome)NINDS (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome)Mayo Clinic (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsArthritis CopingHow Do Injections for Arthritis Work?BlogGluten-Free Diet for Arthritis: 4 Foods That Can Help With InflammationBlogCoping with Feelings of Anger and FrustrationBlogStiff, Painful Shoulder?

ArthritisLiving.todayMenuArthritis SymptomsArthritis CopingBlogSearchSearch Rheumatoid arthritis may affect any joint in your body. The most common body parts that are affected by rheumatoid arthritis are the hands and fingers. How Does Rheumatoid Arthritis Affect Your Hands?FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail5 years ago| by Katrina Hodgins Rheumatoid Arthritis in the HandsThere are 29 joints in each hand. When rheumatoid arthritis strikes in the hands, there are plenty of joints that can be affected.What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis?Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term, progressive, and disabling autoimmune disease—which means your body attacks itself by mistake. The results of these attacks are inflammation, swelling, and pain around the joints.When rheumatoid arthritis in the hands occurs, the joints affected include the large knuckles, middle knuckles, and joints in the wrist that connect the wrist bones to each other. The outermost joints of the fingers are affected by rheumatoid arthritis less frequently, but it can still happen.Causes of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the HandsJoints are susceptible to inflammation for people with rheumatoid arthritis. The nature of an autoimmune disease is to attack cells that the body thinks are dangerous.White blood cells, called leukocytes, are sent out to the hand joints. These white blood cells trigger inflammation in the synovial joints, which are the joints that allow for movement.Symptoms start when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the joints in the handsSymptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the HandsTenderness. The buildup of synovial fluid and thickening joint tissue causes the affected areas to feel sensitive.Symmetrical inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis usually affects both sides of the body equally. The pain and inflammation will mirror the left and right sides. If you have arthritis in the middle joints in one hand, you’re likely to experience the same in your other hand.Pain/Stiffness. You will feel an ache and decreased mobility in the wrists and knuckles. This symptom is worse in the mornings or after long periods of inactivity.Rheumatoid nodules. Hard, round bumps may gradually form under the skin in the affected joints of your fingers and wrists. These nodules are made of inflammatory tissue that builds up the longer you have rheumatoid arthritis. The bumps aren’t usually painful, but if you are concerned about them, you should see a doctor. Medications for rheumatoid arthritis may reduce the size of the nodules.Misalignment of joints. Over time, the destruction of joint tissue and bone erosion may cause deformations in the fingers and thumbs causing them to no longer align properly. With the advent of rheumatoid arthritis medications, there has been a reduction in the likelihood of permanent deformities.Skin flushing. Much like skin flushing you experience when you’ve been exercising or had one too many alcoholic beverages, the skin on your wrists and knuckles may feel warm and become red or purplish in color.Carpal tunnel syndrome. People with rheumatoid arthritis may have tingling and numbness in their hands and fingers.

Many of them also cause other symptoms, including skin problems.Treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis in the HandsThere are a variety of treatment methods for rheumatoid arthritis, ranging from non-medicinal to medicinal to surgical options. The best way to treat rheumatoid arthritis is with good medical management.Non-Medicinal Treatment Options for RA in the HandsOccupational therapy helps strengthen joints in the wrists and fingers. This type of therapy improves hand dexterity and decreases the risk of future joint deformity or misalignment.Occupational therapy helps educate on different ways to perform everyday tasks, which use a variety of tools and techniques, that will accommodate your rheumatoid arthritis and ease the impact on your joints. Occupational therapy may also include exercises that help improve hand function and relieve rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Strengthening and stretching exercises for the hand and wrists can improve grip strength and joint mobility.Splinting through the use of braces stabilizes hand joints to limit further deformity. There are several types of braces, some stabilize individual knuckles and others stabilize the wrist and hand. To ease stress on the joint, splinting is usually combined with injections.Only wear a splint as directed by your doctor; too much of a good thing, in this case, may result in wasting the muscles that support the joint which leads to additional issues. Splinting is prescribed less now because surgery is becoming a more common treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.Medications for RA in the HandsRheumatoid arthritis is usually treated with medication which includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These medications are prescribed to relieve pain and control arthritis as well as help control inflammation and prevent damage to the joints in the hands.Corticosteroid injections are also a common treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and can be done to each joint three to four times a year. These medications are similar to a hormone made naturally by the body. The medication is injected into the affected joints to relieve inflammation. Often injected with long-lasting anesthetic for pain relief. Injections can be repeated as needed for relief of rheumatoid arthritis but should be limited to reduce the risk of side effects.Surgical OptionsFinger and wrist joint surgery are on the rise in recent years. This is a treatment option for those who have lost hand function due to deformity or those who are in severe pain.Surgery is usually pursued after the patient has tried medication and other kinds of therapy. There are a few kinds of surgery available.With joint replacement surgery, the surgeon removes the damaged bone surfaces and replaces them with prostheses made of metal and plastic. For joints with extreme inflammation, the surgeon will go in and remove the damaged tissue from the joint. Surgery may only be a temporary fix to the problem.Talk to your doctor to see if surgery is right for you.Next StepsIf you have rheumatoid arthritis in the hands, make sure you are doing what you can to ease your symptoms through the treatment options suggested above. Your hands are your tools; make sure you’re not putting unnecessary strain on them.ResourcesArthritis-health (Hand Pain and Rheumatoid Arthritis)Arthritis-health (What is a Synovial Joint?)Medical News Today (What is Rheumatoid Arthritis?)Arthritis Foundation (Hand Therapies for Rheumatoid Arthritis)Rheumatoid Arthritis Support Network (RA Surgery: Can You Have Surgery to Remove Rheumatoid Arthritis?)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsArthritis Coping8 Fun and Therapeutic Activities for Arthritis SufferersBlogThe Best and Worst Foods to Eat for People With Rheumatoid ArthritisArthritis CopingDo Arthritis Gloves Help Relieve Pain?Arthritis CopingIs Botox Therapy an Effective Treatment Option for Arthritis?BlogRheumatoid Arthritis vs. OsteoarthritisArthritis Coping10 Therapies to Ease Arthritis Painyou may also likeArthritis SymptomsPsoriatic Arthritis: More Than Skin DeepArthritis Symptoms8 Warning Signs of Rheumatoid ArthritisArthritis Symptoms8 Symptoms of Psoriatic Arthritis to Be Aware OfArthritis SymptomsSeropositive and Seronegative: The 2 Types of Rheumatoid Arthritisconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

It’s a battle I struggle with on a daily basis and admittedly have not mastered since I was diagnosed with arthritis of the spine about two years ago.It can be very difficult to cope with the feelings of anger and frustration caused by the physical limitations and pain osteoarthritis can cause. How do you deal with the pure frustration of living with arthritis? What pulls you out of that dark hole of negative emotions when you're feeling down?My main source of frustration caused by arthritis comes from how long it took for me to get diagnosed with the disease, the rapid change in lifestyle osteoarthritis has caused in my life, and anytime I compare myself physically to what I used to be.One day after playing basketball in my junior year of college I slowly developed an excruciating pain in my back. Despite the tremendous pain I was in, the numerous specialists I saw could not diagnose me.I experienced about three years of doctors telling me that I was either malingering (basically faking it) or that they had no clue as to what was causing me so much pain. The problem was that my MRI did not show any abnormalities. During this time I was very resentful of the health care system, doctors, and the entire situation. I was finally diagnosed last year with facet-joint arthritis in three levels of my spine.Although being validated with a diagnosis helped to relieve some of my frustration with the condition, I still have my moments when I think about how much arthritis has affected my life and compare myself to what I was able to do before I developed it.Before I developed facet-joint arthritis in three levels of my spine at the age of 21, I was always active; I was lifting weights three or four times a week, running about two or three times a week, and playing basketball twice a week. I was maxing out on bench at around 240 lbs and was a proud member of my buddy's intramural basketball team.Then one day I felt a twinge in my back, and the rest is history. Now I have trouble lifting objects heavier than 20 pounds and haven’t run in about four years.I have accepted my reality and have learned to be active in other ways, but I still have my moments when I see someone playing basketball or hear my buddies talk about their latest physical accomplishment. However, I have developed a couple coping mechanisms and strategies to help me deal with some of the negative emotions that osteoarthritis can lead to.Related Search Topics Rheumatoid Arthritis TreatmentsFibromyalgia and RA TreatmentsBack Arthritis Pain ReliefOsteoarthritis Pain Relief You May Also LikeThis Is the Information You Need to Know When an Infection Triggers Reactive ArthritisBlogThis Is the Information You Need to Know When an Infection Triggers Reactive Arthritis5 years ago| by Shaina McQuilkieDid you know that you can develop reactive arthritis as the result of having an infection? Read on to learn more about reactive arthritis here.Maintain PerspectiveThe first thing I try to do is maintain perspective; yes osteoarthritis can be terrible, annoying, and disabling, but there are always people out there who manage with so much less. Similar to a kid who anxiously follows his favorite athlete, I follow various people who have had tremendous challenges in life and have found a way to overcome them, stay positive, and still be a productive member of society. For example; one of my biggest inspirations is Eric Legrand, a former college football player who became paralyzed after a tackle in 2010.Obviously his physical situation is worse than those of us who suffer from osteoarthritis, but he had his accident around the same time my back problems arose. When he first got injured, doctor's said he had a 0-5% chance of ever walking again. Although he has yet to accomplish his goal of walking, Legrand has reached his goals of breathing on his own, moving his neck, and learning to sit on his own.More importantly, he does it with a smile on his face and constant optimism. He is just one of numerous people who do tremendous things in life despite their physical limitations.Distract YourselfThe next strategy I try is to distract myself as much as humanly possible. When I say “distract,” I am not suggesting that you run away from the negative feelings that osteoarthritis may cause. But engaging in a productive activity can help one combat some of those feelings much better than doing nothing and focusing on the pain.For me, this might mean busying myself with homework, writing, going to the gym (despite my wife thinking it's a terrible idea), and even meditating. When I first developed osteoarthritis in my spine, a big challenge I faced was finding hobbies to replace those that involved exercising. Surprisingly, I developed a love for writing and reaching out to others with an adverse health situation like mine. Writing this article, I have the privilege of reaching out to people with my words and also releasing some of the emotions that I have felt in my battle with arthritis.Lastly, I try to remember that most things in life are temporary. This means enjoy the good times and be patient during the tough times because at some point they will probably end. Although the pain from osteoarthritis will probably always be there, that doesn't mean I won't have my good days where I can barely feel the pain.Although I don’t consider myself the most religious of people, my faith has helped me through the tough times and to embrace the mentality that everything is temporary. It is easy to get caught up in any moment, but keeping perspective over the long-term helps me a lot.It would be too easy to simply give in to frustrations and live an anger-filled life. And to be frank, there are times when I want to do that. Who wants to wake-up for a fight with their body every day? It's exhausting and frustrating.I can't predict the future or guarantee my success in this life, but all I can do is try. It would be nice to think that we will all get through life without ever suffering tremendous hardships, but that's simply naive. Life is all about working with the hand you’re dealt, rolling with the punches, and doing things to the best of your ability.These are just a couple of the positive coping strategies I have developed to help me deal with the challenges I face on a daily basis. I would love to hear what you’ve found works for you.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsArthritis CopingManaging Arthritis in the MorningArthritis Symptoms8 Symptoms of Psoriatic Arthritis to Be Aware OfArthritis Symptoms10 Carpal Tunnel Symptoms to Be Aware OfArthritis CopingHow Do Injections for Arthritis Work?Arthritis Coping10 Ways to Relieve Arthritis PainArthritis Coping5 Types of Yoga to Help Arthritis Symptomsyou may also likeBlogWhat Is the Difference Between Osteoporosis and Rheumatoid Arthritis?BlogThe Causes and Symptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis, and How to Treat ItBlogFour Foods You Shouldn’t Eat If You Have ArthritisBlogUnderstanding What Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Isconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

It affects one out of every 100 Canadians and up to 1% of the total global population. It is believed that certain foods can help and trigger symptoms, so we will take a look at the perfect rheumatoid arthritis diet.What Are the Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?Symptoms of RA can include pain, stiffness in the joints and swelling. Many patients start off with pain in just a few joints, only to find their condition worsens over time. Unfortunately, there is no cure for RA, but the inflammation involved can be treated with the right medications and therapies.What Causes Rheumatoid Arthritis?Even though we know that RA is caused by a malfunction in the immune system that causes the body to attack its own joints, the exact cause of this malfunction is still unknown. However, there are some known risk factors for RA. These include:Genetics. You are more likely to get rheumatoid arthritis at some point in your life if you have a family history of it.Sex. Women tend to get rheumatoid arthritis more than men.Age. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs more often in people who are middle aged or older.Environmental factors. Some researchers theorize that certain exposures like asbestos or silica may trigger rheumatoid arthritis.Lifestyle. Smoking, obesity and poor diet may trigger or worsen rheumatoid arthritis.How Does Diet Affect Rheumatoid Arthritis?Though diet is not a huge direct trigger of RA compared to genetics, age and other lifestyle factors, diet can still play a role in the management of RA.RA is an inflammatory condition. Inflammation is the process in which the body’s immune system flares up to fight an infection or something foreign in the body. This is why we get fevers when we are sick. Inflammation is typically a sign that the body is doing its job in keeping itself healthy. However, RA occurs when the immune system is fighting the body itself, not an infection.Because inflammation is a process triggered by the body, foods can greatly impact it. Some foods are anti-inflammatory, suppressing the body’s inflammation process, and other foods are inflammatory, boosting this response. These foods will impact the health of a person with RA.What Foods Are the Best for Rheumatoid Arthritis?The best foods for a person with RA are anti-inflammatory foods. Here are what some of these foods include.Fatty FishFatty fish, like salmon or tuna, contains many omega 3 fatty acids. These are a good kind of fat that many western diets are low in. Your body needs a healthy balance of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids (which are found in red meats) in order to fight off inflammation.Related Search Topics Osteoarthritis Pain ReliefFibromyalgia and RA TreatmentsRA and Fibromyalgia TreatmentsBack Arthritis Pain Relief You May Also LikeHow Does Arthritis Cause Rheumatoid Nodules?BlogHow Does Arthritis Cause Rheumatoid Nodules?4 years ago| by Miles MartinRheumatoid nodules are small lumps that form near joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis. Here's all you need to know about symptoms and treatment.Fruits and VegetablesFruits and vegetables are a huge part of any healthy diet but are especially helpful for people with RA because they are packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. It’s best to eat a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, and about seven to 10 servings per day.Whole GrainsWhole grains help lower levels of C-reactive protein, which is a marker of inflammation. They also contain more nutrients and fiber than refined grains, which is good news whether you have RA or not.Peas and BeansThese are a lean source of protein, which helps promote muscle growth. This is important because many people with RA lose muscle mass because of reduced movement, but other high protein foods like meat and dairy can be inflammatory.NutsNuts combine a lot of the benefits of other foods on this list. They have lots of omega 3 fatty acids (like fish), they have lots of fiber (like whole grains) and they have lots of protein (like peas and beans). They are the ultimate RA snack.Foods to Avoided With Rheumatoid ArthritisHere are some foods that need to be avoided with RA. These are all inflammatory foods.Fatty and Oily FoodsThough some types of fat are good for RA, most fats are considered inflammatory, such as vegetable oils, fats in meat and dairy, and trans fat, found in processed foods. Vegetable oil in particular contains a lot of omega 6 fatty acids, which can ruin a healthy balance of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and can worsen symptoms of inflammation.Red and Processed MeatsThese contain a lot of inflammatory fat and they also contain many unknown chemicals, which is a result of processing. Cured meats like salami and bacon are best to be avoided. Instead, opt for leaner white meats like chicken or turkey.Sugar and StarchSugary foods (like sweets and desserts) and white starchy foods (like French fries and potato chips) can be highly inflammatory because of their high carbohydrate content.GlutenMany patients with RA experience a worsening of their inflammatory symptoms after the consumption of gluten, even if they do not have a specific gluten allergy or celiac disease.Does Rheumatoid Arthritis Require a Special Diet?Certainly not! While there may be some anti-inflammatory benefits to keto, Mediterranean, vegan, or gluten free diets, these certainly are not necessary to live a good life with RA. Many of the foods that are anti-inflammatory are healthy choices whether you have RA or not. Likewise, many inflammatory foods are already foods that should be consumed in moderation (if at all). So, in many ways, a good diet for RA is not much different from a healthy diet for any other person.Some patients with RA can experience malnutrition because certain RA medications, like methotrexate, have been known to cause stomach ulcers, making it more difficult to eat. For this reason, vitamin supplements may be an additional element of RA treatment, but this should be discussed with your doctor.Rheumatoid arthritis is a difficult disease to live with, but by following some of the advice in this article, you can do a small part to take control of your health and live life to the fullest.ResourcesArthritis Society (What is rheumatoid arthritis?)Mayo Clinic (Rheumatoid arthritis) WebMD (What Is Inflammation?)Arthritis Foundation (Foods That Can Help RA Symptoms)Rheumatoid Arthritis Support Network (RA Inflammatory Foods: What Foods Cause Flare-Ups?)Rheumatoid Arthritis Support Network (RA Diet: What Foods to Eat if You Have Rheumatoid Arthritis?)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsArthritis SymptomsArthritis and Your Skin: How Does Arthritis Affect Your Skin?Arthritis CopingCould Penicillin Injections Help Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis?Arthritis Coping8 Ways to Combat Arthritis-Related StiffnessArthritis CopingSix Ways to Manage Psoriatic Arthritis PainArthritis CopingLiving With Lyme ArthritisArthritis Coping10 Exercises to Help Carpal Tunnel Symptomsyou may also likeBlogWhat Is Degenerative Arthritis?BlogWhat Is the Difference Between Osteoporosis and Rheumatoid Arthritis?Blog8 Common Misconceptions About ArthritisBlogGluten-Free Diet for Arthritis: 4 Foods That Can Help With Inflammationconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

After all, your liver is such a regenerative and resilient organ, it can continue to function just enough to keep you going even when there is serious damage and disease at play.Secondary liver cancer is more prevalent than primary liver cancer; the term refers to cancer that originates somewhere else in the body and moves to the liver (metastasizes), where it continues to grow. Once liver cancer symptoms begin to materialize, they normally indicate a later stage cancer, but there is a chance to catch the disease early – and hopefully slow or stop the progression – if you spot any of these suspicious signs.1. Weight LossOne common early symptom of liver cancer is unexplained weight loss, affecting up to 40% of cancer patients at the time of diagnosis. If you’ve been eating regularly but your level activity or level of stress hasn’t increased, the falling number on the scale could point to a serious underlying problem.Often, this initial weight loss is linked to changes in appetite or periodic nausea (two other early cancer symptoms), but the cancer could also be causing changes in your metabolism, leading your body to burn through its calories quickly. When weight loss comes with other changes or new discomforts, it’s time to see a doctor.NextRelated Search Topics Treat Advanced Prostate CancerKidney Cancer MedicationsNew Liver Cancer TreatmentsLung Cancer Immunotherapy You May Also Like7 Signs of Eye Cancer You Shouldn’t IgnoreCancer Symptoms7 Signs of Eye Cancer You Shouldn’t Ignore4 years ago| by Katrina HodginsEye cancer symptoms can often overlap with other eye conditions, so talk to your doctor if your eye health changes.

Benign vs. Malignant Tumors: Understanding the DifferenceFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail6 years ago| by Natalie Saunders Benign vs. Malignant TumorsA tumor is a solid or fluid-filled mass of tissue which can appear almost anywhere in the body. Tumors can be any shape or size, and may be benign or malignant.The Definition of Benign and MalignantPeople often talk about benign and malignant tumors, but what does this mean? The dictionary definition of benign is “not recurrent; favorable for recovery with appropriate treatment.”When talking about tumors, benign means not cancerous or directly threatening to life. It is the opposite of malignant, which is defined as ""tending to become progressively worse and to result in death; having the properties of anaplasia, invasiveness, and metastasis; said of tumors.""This means that cells in malignant tumors can change their structure and travel to other areas of the body. These are the type of tumors which cause cancer, and if left untreated, they may be fatal.Benign vs. Malignant Tumor CharacteristicsBenign TumorsBenign tumors can affect many different parts of the body including organs, glands, nerves, connective tissue and the skin. They will vary in size and shape depending on where they are and what is causing them.Benign tumors are often surrounded by a sac which is created by the immune system to keep them separated from the rest of the body. Benign tumors grow slowly, if at all, and cannot spread to other areas.These tumors are not harmful in themselves but may cause issues such as pain or discomfort if they press against a blood vessel or nerve. Sometimes a benign tumor forms in the endocrine system, on glands such as the pituitary gland or the thyroid. This can cause hormonal imbalances and further, potentially serious symptoms. These symptoms will depend on exactly which glands and hormones are affected.Malignant TumorsThe immune system is usually very effective at destroying cells which could become cancerous, but sometimes a few slip through the net. These cells can quickly grow into malignant tumors, putting your health at risk.Malignant tumors are cancerous and can spread to different areas of the body through the blood or lymphatic system. They grow and travel quickly, meaning that early detection is vital if they are to be stopped. These tumors are graded on a scale from 0–4 which is used to indicate their size and how much they have spread.Like benign tumors, malignant tumors can affect many different areas of the body. Some of the most common are the breasts, testicles, prostate gland, lungs, liver, and stomach.What Is the Difference Between Benign and Malignant Tumors?The main difference between these two types of tumor is that benign tumors are usually harmless, whereas malignant tumors cause cancer.Benign tumors also stay in one area, but malignant tumors can spread throughout the body, affecting different organs and tissues.Related Search Topics Treat Advanced Prostate CancerLung Cancer Treatments Kidney Cancers TreatmentsLung Cancer Treatment Drugs You May Also LikeMetastatic Cancer: Why Cancer SpreadsCancer AwarenessMetastatic Cancer: Why Cancer Spreads8 years ago| by Krystina Ostermeyer RN, BSNCancer that is confined to a single organ or body system is scary. But why does cancer spread? Learn more about why cancer metastasizes.The treatment for benign and malignant tumors is also different. Benign tumors often require no treatment. However, if they are causing symptoms, they may be removed or reduced in size.Malignant tumors must be removed, even if they are not currently causing any symptoms. Early removal of malignant tumors is vital to reduce the risk of cancer cells spreading throughout the body.Are There any Similarities Between Benign and Malignant Tumors?There are many similarities between benign and malignant tumors. They can both affect almost any part of the body, and both can cause masses which may be seen or felt through the skin.Both benign and malignant tumors may cause various symptoms depending on where they are located within the body. Equally, both may be symptom-free in the early stages of development.There is no hard and fast rule for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors without a biopsy. This is a medical test where your physician will take a small sample of tissue from your tumor and check it for cancer cells. If these are found, the tumor is malignant and will need to be removed.In addition to benign and malignant tumors, there is a third type of tumor known as premalignant tumors. This type of tumor is not currently malignant but has the potential to become so in the future. Therefore these type of tumors need close monitoring to prevent them from becoming a health risk.What to Do If a Tumor Is FoundIf you find a new lump, bump or tumor anywhere on your body, it is important not to panic. However, you should get it checked by your physician as soon as possible.In the vast majority of cases, it will turn out to be something harmless, but in the unlikely event that your tumor is malignant, you will want to get it treated as early as you can. This will reduce the risk of the tumor spreading and increase your chances of making a full recovery.ResourcesThe Free Dictionary (Benign)The Free Dictionary (Malignant)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsLiving With CancerYour Diet and CancerCancer TreatmentsHere Are the Five Most Popular Cancer TreatmentsLiving With CancerHow Support Groups Can Help Cancer PatientsLiving With Cancer8 Movies About Cancer You Need to SeeLiving With CancerWhy Does Cancer Cause Weight Loss?Living With CancerFive Great Herbs for Cancer Patientsyou may also likeCancer AwarenessWhat Is Acute Myelogenous Leukemia?Cancer AwarenessAre Skin Tags a Sign of Skin Cancer?Cancer AwarenessDo These Everyday Ingredients Cause Cancer?Cancer Awareness8 Things Every Man Should Know About Prostate Cancerconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

These lumps are commonly detected with a mammography, physical exam, or a different detection technique.While mammography is superior to other detection methods, it is not a substitute for getting to know your breasts and conducting self-breast exams routinely.Self-Breast ExamTo detect a lump, you need to know how your breasts usually feel.The best way to know what your breasts feel like is to conduct a self-breast exam in the shower every month after your menstrual period or pick a date each month that you will perform a self-breast exam if you no longer have periods.Examine each breast and the surrounding tissues including those under your armpits. Your surrounding tissues contain lymph nodes which can become enlarged if breast cancer is present.Lumps in the BreastMany women have dense or naturally lumpy breasts and detecting a lump in a firm, or lumpy tissue can be challenging.While conducting your self-breast exam note any areas that feel different than they did the previous month. Most lumps in breasts that are cancerous are painless.They are often very tiny when detected. Expert diagnosis is needed to evaluate what lesions are. Cancerous lumps usually feel very different than noncancerous lumps or cysts. Cysts are usually tender and smooth. They may increase or decrease inside in size during the month.Cancerous tumors are often irregularly shaped, hard, painless, and immobile. Regardless of whether or not you believe a lump is simply a cyst, calcium deposit, harmless tumor, or cancer it is essential that you notify your healthcare provider immediately upon finding an irregularity.Your healthcare provider will conduct an exam and likely order a mammogram to diagnose the lesion.Other Signs of Breast CancerSome women experience bloody or any other drainage from the nipple when breast cancer is present. Other women notice that their breasts just look different to them.For example, one breast may hang differently than it used to. These changes are both signs of breast cancer and need further evaluation by your healthcare professional.There is a severe type of breast cancer which is fortunately rare. It is called inflammatory breast cancer. Breast tissues may be red, hot, and very painful. The breast may swell. The skin may pucker taking on the appearance of an orange peel.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungTypes of Breast Cancer ChemoNew Cancer PillLung Cancer Treatments You May Also Like7 Signs of Eye Cancer You Shouldn’t IgnoreCancer Symptoms7 Signs of Eye Cancer You Shouldn’t Ignore4 years ago| by Katrina HodginsEye cancer symptoms can often overlap with other eye conditions, so talk to your doctor if your eye health changes. Here are common signs to be aware of.Signs of Advanced Breast CancerThe signs of advanced breast cancer depend upon many factors including prior history and location of metastasis.Locally metastasized breast cancer may cause swelling of the arm on the affected side. Lymph nodes in the chest area or armpit may enlarge. Sometimes women find a new lump in the non-affected breast. A lump may occur due to metastasis, but it may also be an entirely new, unrelated, non-metastatic lesion.Breast cancer can metastasize to any place in the body. Areas where it is most likely to spread to include the other breast, nearby tissues, the bones, liver, brain, and lungs. The signs and symptoms vary based upon the location of the metastasis.For example, liver metastasis may result in the eyes or the skin yellowing. Bruising may occur, and the urine may become dark. The abdomen may swell.If breast cancer spreads to the brain, thinking may be impaired; seizures may occur, personality changes or headaches may arise.Pain is most common sign of cancer which metastasizes to bones. Fractures may occur with minimal movement or force.Breast cancer which spreads to the lungs may result in fatigue, a cough, increased respiratory secretions, and difficulty breathing. The skin may take on a bluish cast, particularly around the mouth, nose, and on the fingers and toes.Diagnostic Tests for Evaluating Breast Cancer Signs and SymptomsProfessional examinations and mammograms are used to locate tumors before self-exam can feel them. The earlier breast cancer is detected, the better the outcomes and the easier the treatment.A diagnostic mammogram and professional examination are conducted if a lump or other irregularity is found. Often lumps are also evaluated with the aid of ultrasound.Other tools for assessing tumors breast cancer include blood tests, x-rays, and MRIs. Some women utilize thermography to help identify tumors.The use of thermography, while helpful, does not substitute for mammograms. Diagnostic testing is conducted if metastasis is suspected or present. These may include bone scans, x-rays, pet scans, and many others.BiopsiesMany types of biopsies are used to evaluate lumps. The simplest kind of biopsy is called fine needle aspiration. A surgeon or other healthcare expert inserts a large bore needle into a tumor and sucks up the contents.The tissue sample is sent to the lab to determine whether they are cancerous or of another origin. This procedure can be done right in a physician's office. A local anesthetic may or may not be administered before the procedure.Stereotactic biopsies can be quite painful. While using an advanced imaging technique called fluoroscopy, a healthcare provider carefully guides a fine wire into a tumor of the breast. A small amount of tissue is removed and sent for evaluation.Should surgery be needed, samples of the tumor are sent to a lab for further investigation.Every breast cancer is different. The lab evaluates the speed of growth, hormone status, and many other factors so that an effective treatment plan can be formulated.Early Diagnosis Equals Great Survival RatesAs a healthcare professional and as a woman who has had breast cancer, I cannot stress the importance of mammography, self and professional breast exams.Get to know your breasts.Most lumps and irregularities prove to be harmless, however, should cancer be present it is essential that you receive early treatment. If you have any symptoms that you suspect may indicate breast cancer, contact your health care provider without delay.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer PreventionCancer Risk Factors and What You Can DoCancer AwarenessCauses of Lung CancerCancer TreatmentsHow a Bone Marrow Transplant Helps Cancer PatientsCancer PreventionWhy Catching Cancer Early Is so ImportantCancer Awareness9 Things You Need to Know About Cervical CancerCancer AwarenessWhat You Need to Know About Stomach Canceryou may also likeCancer SymptomsSymptoms of Pancreatic CancerCancer SymptomsKnowing the Signs of Hodgkin’s LymphomaCancer SymptomsThe Silent Nine Signs of a Brain TumorCancer Symptoms10 Symptoms of Lung Cancer that Shouldn’t Be Ignoredconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

What Treatment Options Are Available for Breast Cancer?FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail5 years ago| by Shaina McQuilkie Breast Cancer TreatmentIn recent years, the mortality rate of women diagnosed with breast cancer has declined drastically due to improved health management programs aimed at alleviating and exterminating cancerous tumors in the mammary organs of women.In this article, we’ll touch upon what breast cancer is, and also discuss the three most commonly recommended treatment options for women diagnosed with breast cancer.What Is Breast Cancer?Breast cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the cells of the breast. A malignant tumor refers to a group of cancerous cells that can invade and destroy nearby tissues; additionally, it has the ability to spread to other areas of the body.Cells in the breast occasionally change and fail to grow or behave in a normal way. These changes can lead to either benign breast conditions, including cysts and atypical hyperplasia, or non-malignant tumors such as intraductal papillomas.Conversely, in some individuals the changes in the cells of the breast cause breast cancer. Usually, breast cancer begins in the cells that line the ducts; this type of cancer is known as ductal carcinoma. However, it can also start in the cells of the lobules; this type of cancer is known as lobular carcinoma.Both of these cancers can be in situ, meaning that the cancer remains where it started and has not invaded surrounding tissues, or invasive, meaning that the cancer has spread into surrounding tissues.Other less common types of breast cancer include inflammatory breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and Paget disease of the breast. Rare types of breast cancer include soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.How Is Breast Cancer Treated?The three most commonly recommended conventional treatment options for breast cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation.The type of treatment for each patient depends on various factors including the type of cancer, stage of disease, and patient preference. In some cases, a multidisciplinary approach to treatment may be utilized. Additionally, there are a variety of complementary and alternative options such as yoga, acupuncture, and meditation that may be helpful for some patients when used in conjunction with traditional treatment options.Below we’ll discuss the three most common treatment options in a little more detail so you can better understand each option.Breast Cancer SurgerySurgery is typically the first line of attack against breast cancer and involves removal of the tumor, its surrounding tissues, or the whole breast itself to remove cancerous cells.Breast cancer surgery may include removal of the entire breast, which is known as a mastectomy, or may be breast conserving, which is known as a partial mastectomy.Breast-conserving surgery or partial mastectomy involves the removal of a part of the breast depending on the site and size of the tumor. There are two types of this surgery:Lumpectomy – removal of the lump and a small amount of surrounding tissue.Quadrantectomy – removal of a quarter of the breast tissue.Mastectomy involves the removal of the entire breast. The types of mastectomy include:Total or simple mastectomy – removal of the entire breast and nipple.Nipple-sparing mastectomy – removal of the entire breast without the removal of the nipple to preserve it for reconstructive surgery. This procedure can only be done if the tumor is far from the nipple and if the cancer has not spread to the nipple.Skin-sparing mastectomy – removal of the entire breast without the removal of the skin of the breast.Modified radical mastectomy – removal of the breast and the lymph nodes of the axilla or armpit.Radical mastectomy – removal of the breast, lymph nodes, and muscles under the affected breast.During a mastectomy or partial mastectomy, the surgeon may also perform lymph node removal or sentinel lymph node dissection, if the biopsy has revealed that the cancerous cells have spread outside of the milk duct.Related Search Topics Breast Cancer HelpTypes of Breast Cancer ChemoTreat Advanced Prostate CancerKidney Cancers Treatments You May Also LikeColon Cancer Treatment PlansCancer TreatmentsColon Cancer Treatment Plans4 years ago| by Katrina HodginsThe variety of colon cancer treatments can be overwhelming for some people. It is important to learn about all the options and see which is right for you.Radiation Therapy for Breast CancerRadiation therapy involves using high-energy rays to remove and destroy cancer cells. This type of treatment may be given through external beam radiation or brachytherapy.Radiation therapy is usually given to patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery to prevent recurrence of cancer cell growth. Those who have had a mastectomy may undergo radiation therapy as well if the lumps they had are more than 5 cm in size, or if cancer is present in the lymph nodes.External beam radiation is a procedure where a person is exposed to radiation using a machine focused on the affected area. Each treatment session usually lasts for several minutes and is performed five days a week for 5 to 6 weeks.Brachytherapy, also called internal radiation, is a procedure that involves introducing radiation inside the body through radioactive seeds. There are two types of brachytherapy:Interstitial involves placement of catheters with pellets in the area where the cancerous cells were removed and for several periods during the day.Intracavitary involves the placement of a device in place of the tissue that was removed and kept in place until the treatment is finished.Chemotherapy for Breast CancerChemotherapy involves using medications to kill cancer cells in the body. These medications may be given by mouth or via injection into the vein. In many cases, a combination of chemotherapy medications may be used at the same time to improve treatment outcomes.Chemotherapy may be recommended before or after surgery. Chemotherapy is given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy, while chemotherapy given after surgery is called adjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used to decrease the size of the tumor so that operation is less extensive. Adjuvant chemotherapy is used to kill cancer cells after surgery to prevent recurrence of the cancer.There are various side effects chemotherapy including mouth sores, nausea and vomiting, hair loss, changes in appetite, easy bruising, fatigue, and increased risk of infection.Research has shown that standard chemotherapy treatment lowers the risk of recurrence when administered in the early stages of the disease, while it helps to shrink or eliminate cancer in approximately 30 percent to 60 percent of individuals with advanced stages of breast cancer.ConclusionIf you’ve been diagnosed with breast cancer, you’ll want to thoroughly discuss all available breast cancer treatment options with your healthcare provider. Choosing the right treatment option, taking into account all of the risks and side effects of the treatment, is essential to optimize your chance of a full recovery and optimize your quality of life.It’s important to keep in mind that choosing the appropriate treatment option is a decision that is ultimately made by the patient and their loved ones, after taking into account recommendations from various healthcare practitioners.ResourcesCanadian Cancer Society (What is Breast Cancer?)Breastcancer.org (Treatment and Side Effects)National Cancer Institute (Breast Cancer Treatment)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer PreventionHow to Check for 4 Common CancersCancer AwarenessHow Cancer Cells Start, Grow and SpreadCancer AwarenessWhat Causes Bladder Cancer?Cancer Prevention10 of the Best Cancer-Fighting Foods to Add to Your DietCancer AwarenessEverything You Need to Know About Donating to CancerCancer Prevention10 Things You Can Do to Prevent Skin Canceryou may also likeCancer TreatmentsHow Stem Cell Transplants Are Used for Cancer PatientsCancer TreatmentsThe Latest in Cancer Treatment: Proton Beam TherapyCancer TreatmentsWhat are White Blood Cell Boosters?Cancer TreatmentsHow a Bone Marrow Transplant Helps Cancer Patientsconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Understanding How Cancerous Tumors FormFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail4 years ago| by Katrina Hodgins Important Information on Cancerous TumorsOver time, normal cells may become cancer cells, and these cancer cells may encourage the growth of a tumor. Tumors may be benign or malignant, and there are some important distinctions, especially when it comes to cancerous tumors.What Is a Cancerous Tumor?By biological design, normal cells die off after they grow old or become damaged and are replaced by new cells.Cancerous tumors begin when the old or damaged cells don’t die off, but new cells continue to form. Over time, cells can mutate, and these abnormal cells may not die off when they should, or they keep multiplying. This abundance of extra cells gradually forms lumps of tissue mass in the body, and these tumors vary in type and size.Cancerous tumors are malignant, which is another way of saying they can invade surrounding tissues.Causes of Cancerous TumorsCancerous tumors can start anywhere in the body. Their location usually suggests its shape and how the tumor will grow. But why do these tumors appear in the first place? The cause can be as simple as DNA.There are three main types of genes which contribute to cancer:Proto-oncogenes: these genes are involved in regular cell growth and division. If these genes become abnormal or hyperactive, they may become cancer-causing genes (oncogenes). Oncogenes let cells grow and continue to live when they should die off.Tumor-suppressor genes: these genes are also involved in cell growth and division. Specific abnormalities in these genes may cause cells to divide uncontrollably and may eventually become a tumor.DNA repair genes: it’s no surprise that the job of these genes is to fix damaged DNA. Mutations in these genes can cause additional mutations in the DNA they are supposed to repair. A combination of damaged DNA repair genes and improper DNA maintenance by these genes cause the cells to become cancerous.Many gene mutations you are not born with, but you acquire throughout life. External forces can also cause gene mutations such as smoking (including second-hand smoke), carcinogens, radiation (such as UV radiation), viruses, hormones, chronic inflammation, and obesity.SymptomsSymptoms will depend on the location of the tumor and whether the tumor has invaded nearby tissues that affect other body functions. Symptoms that may appear in tandem with a cancerous tumor are:A lump, or thickening of an area, that can be felt under the skinFatigueUnintended weight changesChanges in bowel or bladder functionDiscomfort or issues after eatingIssues breathingPersistent coughUnexplained joint or muscle painUnexplained fever or night sweatsUnexplained bleeding or bruisingBenign Versus Malignant TumorsTumors can be benign or malignant. When your doctor can diagnose which kind of tumor you have, they will be able to prescribe the proper treatment. There are a few significant differences between benign and malignant tumors.Benign TumorsCells in benign tumors are similar to normal cells, which means that these tumors may grow rather slowly, and they usually have a covering made up of normal cells and are contained within a fibrous connective tissue. These types of tumors typically have a smooth and regular shape.Benign tumors do not spread into healthy tissues, but they can grow to large sizes and cause the surrounding area to have to accommodate the growth. When benign tumors are removed, they seldom grow back, making tumor removal an effective treatment.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungKidney Cancer MedicationsTreat Metastatic Breast CancerLung Cancer Treatments You May Also LikeWhat Is the Cause of Multiple Myeloma?Cancer AwarenessWhat Is the Cause of Multiple Myeloma?6 years ago| by Eric PattersonMultiple myeloma is cancer that starts in the bone marrow's plasma cells and may be present for some time before symptoms emerge.Malignant TumorsCancerous tumors are the malignant type of tumor. Malignant tumors grow at a faster pace than benign tumors and cause damage to the surrounding tissues. Cancerous tumors have abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably to form the mass.This type of tumor may metastasize to other parts of the body. Cancer cells can break off the tumors and travel through the blood or lymph system to form secondary tumors in other areas.When malignant tumors are surgically removed, there is the possibility that they can grow back, so be aware if any lumps come back after removal.Tumor Grade SystemIf a tumor is suspected to be malignant, a doctor will attempt to remove all of it during a biopsy and examine the tissue to see if it’s benign or malignant.A grading system is used to classify a tumor based on how abnormal the tumor cells look under a microscope. Tumors are classified by the type of cancer, based on their appearance under a microscope and pattern of growth.The purpose of the classification is to indicate how quickly the tumor is expected to grow and spread. And it includes histologic and nuclear grade. There are five grades:GX: The grade cannot be assessed (undetermined grade)G1: Well defined cells (low grade where the cells appear close to normal)G2: Moderately differentiated cells (medium/intermediate grade)G3: Poorly differentiated cells (high grade where the cells do not look normal and spread quickly)G4: Undifferentiated (highest grade)Treatment for Cancerous TumorsDiagnosis and treatment are based on the type, size, stage, and location of the tumor. Some patients only use one treatment, but many patients will use a combination of treatments. Benign tumors often don’t need treatment but may require medical intervention to reduce the size of the tumor, sometimes through surgery.Cancerous tumors are usually treated with one of three methods (each with their own side effects):Chemotherapy: This treatment uses drugs to kill cancer cells. It is a recommended and effective treatment against cancer.Radiation Therapy: This cancer treatment uses high doses of radiation to kill the cancer cells and reduce the size of tumors. There are different types of radiation available.Surgery: The surgeon does a procedure to remove the cancer from the body.Catching a cancerous tumor early is the best line of defense. To give yourself the best chance of locating a cancerous tumor before it spreads, make sure you’re screening yourself for lumps. There are plenty of online resources to check yourself at home, or you can make an appointment with your doctor to give you an examination.By switching to a healthier lifestyle and avoiding carcinogens (and other external forces that cause tumors), we can give ourselves a better chance at preventing a cancerous tumor from appearing.ResourcesNational Cancer Institute (What is Cancer?)National Cancer Institute (Tumor Grade)Healio (What is a Tumor?)Canadian Cancer Society (Types of Tumors)Research UK (How Cancers Grow)Mayo Clinic (Cancer)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer PreventionHow to Check for 4 Common CancersLiving With CancerGoing Through Cancer While PregnantLiving With Cancer8 Movies About Cancer You Need to SeeLiving With CancerDepression, Anxiety, Stress and CancerCancer Symptoms9 Warning Signs of Liver CancerCancer TreatmentsMedical Marijuana: Can It Really Help Cancer Patients?you may also likeCancer AwarenessLung Cancer and Smoking: The Best Reason to Quit SmokingCancer AwarenessEverything You Need to Know About Donating to CancerCancer AwarenessColon Cancer: Symptoms, Screening, and Prevention TipsCancer AwarenessWhat to Know About Cachexia and Cancerconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

CancerLiving.todayMenuAwarenessSymptomsPreventionTreatmentsLiving With CancerSearchSearch Cancer remission means that you are completely cancer-free or partially cancer-free, but cancer may return at a later date. What Does Cancer Remission Mean?FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail5 years ago| by Sheree McDonald What Is Cancer Remission?Cancer is a complex diagnosis that can mean different things for different people. Some diseases are incredibly aggressive and have a very low survival rate while others have a higher chance of going into remission. It’s important for patients and their families to understand cancer remission and what it means for the long-term.Types of Cancer RemissionEssentially, remission means that the body does not have cancer or has improved considerably. There are two types of remission when it comes to cancer.Complete RemissionComplete remission means that the doctor can no longer see any signs of cancer in the body. However, it’s important that even in the case of complete remission; there may be microscopic cancer cells that can’t be detected with the current medical technology.Partial RemissionPartial remission indicates that cancer has shrunk or stabilized for a period of time. Usually, partial remission is determined if a tumor size has decreased by 50 percent and has remained that size for at least one month.While partial remission may improve the quality of life of a patient, patients should understand that the cancer is still present and active in the body. Keep in mind, while complete remission may be favorable news to a patient, it does not mean that cancer will never return to the body.Remission vs. CuredRemission is not the same as cured. A cancer cure indicates that the disease has been eradicated and will never return to the body. At this time, there is no cure for cancer. Remission essentially means that you are completely cancer-free or partially cancer-free, but cancer may return at a later date. The prognosis for cancer returning depends on a variety of factors, and there is no sure way to determine whether or not cancer will remain in remission.Patients should be aware that the longer they are in remission, the less likely it is that cancer will return. However, doctors disagree about the timeline of remission and what it may mean for patients simply because some cancers have a higher remission rate than others. It is difficult to determine the expected remission of all cancer patients because there are so many variables in each case.How Do You Get in Remission?Your doctor can provide more insight into the specific treatment plan that can help you get to remission. However, some factors will influence the likeliness of this happening. Those factors include:The type of cancer.The stage of cancer.Side effects of treatment options.Overall health.Age of patient.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungLung Cancer ImmunotherapyLiver Cancer Survival RatesLung Cancer Treatments You May Also LikePregnancy and CancerLiving With CancerPregnancy and Cancer9 years ago| by Angie FinlayLet's take a look at some of the dangers and risks of pregnancy and cancer.

However, typical methods your doctor may try include:Bone marrow transplant.Radiation therapy.Chemotherapy.Drug therapy.Hormone therapy.Immunotherapy.Your doctor will provide insight into your prognosis and the best avenue for treatment based on your lifestyle and your exact situation.Tips for Staying Cancer-FreeRemaining cancer-free is the goal of every patient and their doctor. Even if your cancer goes into remission, it’s essential to follow the tips that your doctor suggests to increase your chances of remaining cancer-free for many years or even a lifetime.Remember, there is no guarantee that cancer will never return, but you can play an active role in maintaining your health.Some of those tips may include:Continue cancer care. Even if you are in remission, you should continue regular check-ups and evaluations to make sure that cancer has not returned. Remember, early detection is key to treating cancer, and if your doctor can diagnose it early enough then you can increase the chances of it going into remission again.Continue treatments while in partial remission. Your doctor may offer a less aggressive treatment plan while you are in partial remission, but you should continue to treatments as suggested. Remember, partial remission is not total remission, and proper treatments could influence whether cancer goes into complete remission or not. Often, people feel better when their cancer goes into partial remission, but treatment will help keep you feeling better.It’s also important to maintain a healthy diet. Several studies indicate that proper nutrition can help the body remain cancer-free.Avoid smoking.Maintain an active lifestyle by exercising or participating in some other regular physical activity a few times per week.Don’t forget the emotional toll that cancer can take on your mind. Stress and anxiety can influence remission rates. Ask your doctor about support groups in your area.OverviewCancer remission is undoubtedly good news for the patient.

Understanding the 6 Common Types of Childhood CancerFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail4 years ago| by Shaina McQuilkie What Are the Different Types of Childhood Cancer?Having a child diagnosed with cancer is the worst nightmare of every parent. Watching an innocent child fight childhood cancer is heart wrenching and can have a devastating effect on families.The statistics on childhood cancer are shocking; every two minutes a child is diagnosed with cancer in the world, 1 in 285 children are diagnosed with cancer before the age of 20 in the U.S. and cancer is the second leading cause of death in children, after accidental injuries.What Is Childhood Cancer?Childhood cancer refers to cancer in children under the age of 15. Cancer among children can be quite different from adult cancers in terms of how it spreads, available treatment methods and their response to treatment.Causes of Childhood CancerThe exact cause of most childhood cancers remains unknown. However, it is believed that most childhood cancer cases are the result of gene mutation that causes abnormal cell growth resulting in cancer. Although certain environmental exposures play a vital role in causing cancer in adults, pinpointing environmental factors that trigger cancer in children has proven to be quite difficult.Types of Childhood CancerThere are more than 100 different types of cancers. Some of the most common types of cancers found in children:LeukemiaLymphomaBrain CancerNeuroblastomaRhabdomyosarcomaOsteosarcoma or bone cancerLeukemiaLeukemia, cancer of bone marrow cells, is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in children, accounting for 28% of all childhood cancer cases in the U.S.Bone marrow produces red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. White blood cells are responsible for fighting various types of infections. However, when a child has leukemia, their bone marrow produces immature and abnormal white cells that are unable to fight the invading infection.Eventually, these mutated white blood cells outnumber the healthy blood cells within the body, resulting in infections and prolonged bleeding after injury. Leukemia has the potential to metastasize and spread from the bone marrow, through the blood vessels, to all parts of the body. Common symptoms:Constant feverWeakness and fatigueFrequent infectionsWeight lossSwollen lymph nodesEnlarged spleen and/or liverNosebleedsBone aches and tendernessExcessive sweatingRelated Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungBreast Cancer HelpKidney Cancer MedicationsLiver Cancer Survival Rates You May Also LikeImportant Information That You Should Know About Metastatic Pancreatic CancerCancer AwarenessImportant Information That You Should Know About Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer5 years ago| by Natalie SaundersWhen pancreatic cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is referred to as metastatic pancreatic cancer, or Stage IV. Read on to learn more.LymphomaLymphoma is characterized by abnormal cell division in the lymphatic system of the body. The lymphatic system consists of the lymph nodes, thymus gland, spleen and bone marrow. All these elements combined form the body’s germ-fighting network or immune system. Like leukemia, lymphoma also produces weak white blood cells that end up crowding the healthy lymphoid cells of the body. The two types of lymphoma – Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s - are responsible for 6% of the childhood cancer cases in the U.S. Common symptoms:Oval or round shaped painless swelling of the lymph nodes located in the neck, groin, and/or armpit regionPersistent weakness and fatigueFeverItchy skinBreathing difficultiesUnexplained weight lossBrain CancerChildhood brain cancer is caused by abnormal cell growth in the brain or surrounding tissues. The tumors formed due to unnatural cell division can be either cancerous (malignant), or non-cancerous (benign). Four types of brain cancers are common in children and adolescents:Astrocytoma: cancer of the supportive brain tissues or astrocytesBrain-stem gliomas: cancer at the base of the brain or spinal cordEpendymoma: cancer of the ependymal cells in the lining of the brain’s ventricles where the cerebrospinal fluids are producedPrimitive neuroectodermal tumors: cancer of the primitive nerve cells of the brainAs brain tumors grow, they apply pressure and alter the function of surrounding nervous tissue, which can result in symptoms such as headaches, nausea, seizures, blurred vision and memory problems.NeuroblastomaNeuroblastoma is characterized by abnormal growth of immature nerve cells, mostly in the adrenal glands located on top of the kidneys. However, it can also develop in the chest, abdomen, neck, or the spinal region. 90% of the cases of neuroblastoma are found in children under the age of 5. Common symptoms:Abdominal painDiarrhea or constipationChest painDrooping eyelidsFormation of lumps under the skinProtruding eyeballsBack painFeverBone aches and tendernessRhabdomyosarcomaRhabdomyosarcoma is cancer of the soft skeletal muscle tissues. It can also begin in the hollow organs such as the bladder and uterus. Although it is rare, it is more prevalent in children than in adults. Symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma include swelling or lumps in the arms or legs, blood in the urine with irregular bowel movements, headaches and nosebleeds.Bone CancerBone cancer is initiated by the formation of painful lumps on bones that restrict the growth of normal bones and hinders stability. It typically affects the pelvis and the longer bones of the body like the arms and legs. Bone cancers can potentially spread to the lungs and other bones and soft tissues. Common symptoms:Bone pain that comes and goesPain that does not respond to pain medicationSwelling and tenderness around the affected areaWeakened bone that fractures easilyFatigueTreatment for Childhood CancerCancer treatment depends on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. The common types of treatments are chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy and stem cell transplants.Any of these procedures can be prescribed as a standalone treatment, in combination with one another, or as palliative care if the cancer is too advanced. Some of these treatments have short-term and long-term side effects. It’s important to discuss the potential risks with a pediatric oncologist.In ConclusionHaving a child diagnosed with cancer can be very hard, but parents need to stay focused and keep their child motivated. It takes a combined effort of doctors, parents and the child to overcome cancer. Every year, there are breakthroughs in childhood cancer research and treatment. With proper treatment and rehabilitation, your child can hopefully live a very long and productive life.ResourcesNIH (Cancer in Children and Adolescents)healthychildren.org (Types of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers)MedlinePlus (Cancer in Children)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsLiving With CancerHow Cancer Changes Your Outlook on LifeLiving With CancerChemotherapy and Coping With Hair LossCancer TreatmentsHere Are the Five Most Popular Cancer TreatmentsLiving With CancerGoing Through Cancer While PregnantCancer SymptomsBone Metastasis: What You Need to KnowCancer Symptoms15 Ovarian Cancer Symptoms You Shouldn’t Overlookyou may also likeCancer AwarenessUnderstanding the Types of SarcomaCancer AwarenessDo These Everyday Ingredients Cause Cancer?Cancer AwarenessWhat’s the Difference Between Gum Cancer and Gingivitis?Cancer AwarenessWhat to Know About Cachexia and Cancerconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

CancerLiving.todayMenuAwarenessSymptomsPreventionTreatmentsLiving With CancerSearchSearch Cryoablation for cancer is a type of treatment that freezes the cancer-affected area in the body. Cryoablation: An Alternative Cancer TreatmentFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail4 years ago| by Katrina Hodgins Cryoablation for CancerWith cryoablation for cancer, the term “freezing to death” is not an exaggeration, but a fitting description. This type of treatment literally causes cells to freeze and die off—including cancer cells.What Is Cryoablation for Cancer?Cryoablation is a minimally invasive cancer treatment that uses intense cold to treat small tumors. Also referred to as cryosurgery or cryotherapy, cryoablation treats other conditions such as pre-cancerous skin moles, skin tags, nodules, retinoblastomas and more.Cryoablation targets diseased tissues and freezes that tissue using a tool called a cryoprobe. The cryoprobe is a small, wand-like needle that is inserted through the skin directly into a tumor. Gas pumps from tanks into the cryoprobe, causing the tissue to freeze. The tissue is given time to thaw and is then blasted with another round of freezing gas. This freeze and thaw cycle is repeated several times throughout a single treatment session.Is Cryoablation Used to Treat Cancer?Cryoablation targets, freezes and destroys diseased tissue, including cancer cells. This treatment helps relieve both pain and symptoms caused by cancer, and it can effectively target the affected areas. In some cases, cryoablation may be the primary treatment for bone, cervical, eye, kidney, liver, lung and prostate cancer.How Cryoablation Kills Cancer CellsLiving tissues, both healthy and diseased, are not meant to endure intense cold. There are a few ways that cryoablation works:Cellular dehydration occurs when ice forms in the fluid outside the cellsIce forms within the cell and the cell is destroyed by ice crystalsThe cell bursts due to swelling from ice expanding within the cellA loss of blood supply to the cellCryoablation Treatment ProcessPreparationLeading up to your appointment, your doctor or specialist provides preparation instructions. Prior to giving the green light for cryoablation, they will need to know of any recent illnesses, medical conditions, allergies, current medications (including supplements), whether you are pregnant and other information that may affect treatment. Your doctor may advise you to stop taking certain drugs, such as aspirin or blood thinners, prior to the procedure. As a safeguard against infection on the day of the procedure, you may be given a dose of antibiotics or moderate sedation to manage discomfort.Tools and TechnologyCryoablation uses a few tools during treatment. Of course, the cryoprobe is an important component, as it dispenses the liquid nitrogen or argon gas to the diseased tissue site. A computer controls the flow of gas from the tanks to ensure the right amount is dispensed. To direct the cryoprobes to the treatment sites inside the body, the specialist uses imaging guidance, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance (MR).How Cryoablation Treatment WorksIn order to kill cells, the doctor needs to freeze and thaw the cells for at least two cycles. To treat tissue on the skin’s surface, such as a skin tag, the cold treatment is applied topically using a cotton swab or spray device. For treatment of tissues inside the body, the physician makes a small incision at the site just big enough to insert the cryoprobe, which delivers the gas once it’s in place. After the cancer cells are destroyed, your white blood cells swarm the area to remove the dead tissue.RecoveryThe procedure takes up to three hours depending on how many cycles of freezing and thawing are needed. After the cryoprobe is removed, the physician applies pressure to stop any bleeding. Usually the incision is so small, sutures are not necessary. An overnight stay is generally not required for cryoablation and recovery time is pretty quick. The procedure results are sent to your referring physician and you may need to schedule a follow-up visit to check on your recovery progress.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungBreast Cancer HelpKidney Cancers TreatmentsLiver Cancer Survival Rates You May Also LikeThe Latest in Cancer Treatment: Proton Beam TherapyCancer TreatmentsThe Latest in Cancer Treatment: Proton Beam Therapy5 years ago| by Katrina HodginsProton beam therapy is a type of external beam radiation therapy that uses high-energy beams to treat tumors.

Possible side effects:PainBleedingInfectionLower body temperatureDoes Cryoablation Treatment Work?Studies show positive results in select patients, particularly in treatment of the bones, kidneys, liver and lungs. Since this is still considered a newer treatment there, is not much information available for the long-term effectiveness of cryoablation. Studies and research are ongoing to determine the long-term outcomes for this freezing treatment.Cryoablation offers another option for treatment of cancer and other conditions; your doctor can help determine if cryoablation is a suitable treatment for you.ResourcesMayo Clinic (Cryoablation for cancer)Canadian Cancer Society (Cryosurgery)RadiologyInfo.org (Cryotherapy)Cleveland Clinic (Cryoablation) FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer SymptomsThe Causes, Signs and Symptoms of MesotheliomaLiving With Cancer5 Unexpected Cancer Support InitiativesCancer SymptomsSymptoms of Pancreatic CancerCancer AwarenessAre Cysts Cancerous or Not?Living With CancerWhat to Eat During ChemoLiving With CancerFive Great Herbs for Cancer Patientsyou may also likeCancer TreatmentsWhat are White Blood Cell Boosters?Cancer TreatmentsTreatment Plans for Uterine SarcomaCancer TreatmentsRadiation or Chemo?

Cancer itself, along with the therapies used to treat it, may alter your body’s ability to process food. Therefore, a high-calorie, high-protein diet is recommended before and during treatment to help maintain energy levels and a stable weight.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungLung Cancer ImmunotherapyKidney Cancer MedicationsLiver Cancer Survival Rates You May Also LikeDepression, Anxiety, Stress and CancerLiving With CancerDepression, Anxiety, Stress and Cancer8 years ago| by Eric PattersonA cancer diagnosis carries huge amounts of emotional weight; fear grows like weeds in a garden. Stress and cancer has a large impact on your mental health.Diet Before TreatmentYou must start eating healthy to prepare yourself for bone cancer treatment. In addition to reserving your strength, it will boost your immune system to help you fight off infections. Maintaining a healthy diet may also help you cope with the side effects of cancer treatment, and deal with a higher dosage of medication, if necessary.Your diet before starting cancer treatment should look like:High protein foods: dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt), eggs, chicken and lean red meat, fish, beans, seeds and nutsHigh-calorie foods: dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt), gravies, salad dressing and saucesDiet During Cancer TreatmentYour diet during your cancer treatment will differ depending on the treatment you receive.For SurgeryIf you have had cancer surgery, you will need to consume more calories and protein to encourage your body to heal. Frequent small snacks and meals, as well as plenty of water to prevent hydration are recommended. Try to avoid greasy and/or fried foods as they can be hard to digest.For RadiationIf you are undergoing radiation therapy, it is recommended that you eat something before each treatment session. Again, frequent, small meals and snacks, as well as adequate hydration are recommended. Try to plan larger meals at times during the day when you feel your best.For ChemotherapyIf you are receiving chemotherapy, the nausea associated with treatment can severely impact your desire to eat. Consuming a small, healthy snack prior to treatment can help to ward off the nausea associated with treatment. It’s important to eat when you are feeling good and be sure to consume a sufficient amount of quality calories, including protein, during these times to help boost your energy. Frequent, small meals and snacks, as well as adequate water consumption to stay hydrated can be beneficial when you are not feeling well. Try to avoid greasy and/or fried foods as they can be difficult to digest.Diet After TreatmentAfter successful completion of your cancer treatment, it is essential to consume a healthy diet to aid your recovery. Ideally, your diet after bone cancer treatment should look like:Five to seven small snacks or meals containing a variety of fruits and veggiesHigh-fiber foods including cereals and whole-grain breadsAvoid greasy and/or fried goods, opt for baked or broiled options insteadDairy productsIt’s also important to limit your alcohol consumption (one drink per day for women, and two drinks per day for men).Dietary Supplements for Bone CancerDietary supplements are beneficial, as they help to address some of the nutritional deficiencies you may experience during bone cancer treatment.Commonly recommended supplements:Multivitamins containing vitamins A, B-complex, C, E and trace minerals like calcium, magnesium, selenium and zincOmega 3 fatty acids in fish oil to boost your immunity and decrease inflammationCalcium and vitamin D to strengthen your bonesProbiotic supplements for gastrointestinal healthBefore taking any supplement, it is essential to discuss it with your oncologist and nutritionist.Foods to AvoidIt’s important that you and/or your family member be cautious when handling, cooking and storing food. Additionally, avoiding certain foods is recommended:Cold hot dogs (ensure that hot dogs are cooked until they are steaming hot)Processed meatUnpasteurized milk including raw milk and yogurtSmoked fishRefrigerated pâtéUnwashed vegetables and fruitsUnpasteurized fruit juiceRaw sproutsUndercooked beef and other meatsIn ConclusionUnfortunately, there is no miraculous diet that will cure your cancer or prevent it from coming back.

Facing the changing weather is challenging. Pushing through the crowds in the stores is a struggle. Balancing the wants of others against your own needs adds to your level of stress.Although this time of year is meant to be a joyful celebration, the pressure and anxiety have a tendency to overwhelm the positives and make the whole time of year a negative, arduous journey.Now you have another problem to contend with, but this is not only a seasonal issue. It is a situation that is long lasting and life changing — cancer.Unfortunately, your cancer does not take a break during the holiday season. It does not alleviate mid-November and resume on the first of the year.This unrelenting condition will make good situations bad and bad situations worse if you allow it. Rather than succumbing to the weight of cancer during the holidays, choose to combat the stress.By practicing prevention and addressing your needs, you can make the holidays with cancer better than those of the past.Care for Your Physical HealthCancer is primarily a physical health condition. Because of this, you need to do everything in your power to ensure your physical health is as good as it can be.If your physical health is suffering, the stress and responsibilities of the holidays will compound. Everything will feel worse. To combat this, consider the following:Follow your doctor’s recommendations. If you trust your doctor and treatment team, it will be essential to follow their recommendations to create the best situation for your physical health.Eat well. Cancer and the treatment that follows commonly lead to many issues with appetite. Plus, your energy will be lower, which makes the prospect of standing in front of the stove preparing a meal much less appealing. Without healthy foods, you cannot function at your best. During the holidays, there will be ample opportunities to indulge in comfort foods, but do so in moderation.Exercise. Just like with eating well, the lack of energy associated with cancer treatment will make exercise an afterthought. Work to change this trend for better results. Exercise will improve your physical health greatly, but it will lower stress and boost your mental health along the way.Sleep well. Speaking of physical health measures that improve your mental health, try to renew your focus on restful sleep. Do not accept poor sleep as an effect of cancer. Along with diet and exercise, sleep is a very useful tool to lower stress, aid in your recovery, and improve your decision-making skills. These benefits are needed during the holidays more than any other time.Care for Your Mental HealthCaring for your physical health will set the stage for you to manage holiday stress, but the real work will be done with your mental health. Yes, cancer is physical, but the implications extend well into your mental health status.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungCancer Immunotherapy TreatmentLung Cancer Treatment Drugs Lung Cancer Treatments You May Also Like9 Celebrities Who Have Battled CancerLiving With Cancer9 Celebrities Who Have Battled Cancer9 years ago| by Ashleigh-Dawn WatsonPerhaps the scariest word to hear out of your doctor's mouth, cancer is a far-reaching disease that still baffles scientistsInspect Your Self-TalkSelf-talk is the ongoing conversation you have with yourself throughout the day. Self-talk plays a massive role in influencing your feelings.Often, self-talk can be overly negative and irrational, which could change your views of the holidays. You can never be sure of the holiday outcomes, and thinking poorly about the gatherings may lead to self-fulfilling prophecies where your views influence your perceptions.To overcome this, focus on the positive interactions that could come with the visit. Arriving with a sense of hope will improve your chances of better outcomes.Modify Your ExpectationsHolidays are times of great traditions and routines. You may feel a large amount of pressure to maintain the activities in the past even though you are not physically able to this year.Conversely, you may feel like you can no longer do anything with your diagnosis and cancel all of your plans. Modifying your expectations means that you arrive at conclusions that match your abilities with doing too much or too little.If you expect too much of yourself, you could be let down and feel like a failure. If you expect too little, you could miss out on some healthy interactions.RelaxYou already know the holidays add to your stress, and you know cancer adds to your stress. Because of the double intensity, you need to find double the stress relief.Much of this can come from forms of relaxation. Engaging in specific relaxation techniques like deep breathing, guided imagery, autogenics, and progressive muscle relaxation will manage your stress quickly and efficiently.Other options like yoga and forms of meditation will be very helpful as well. Sitting on the couch, swiping through social media, and consuming alcohol and other drugs are passive experiences and do not create much relaxation. They may even make stress worse.Clarify Your CommunicationOnce your expectations are established, communicate your plans to the important people in your life. Remember, they have been developing their own expectations of you and the holidays along the way.Chances are good that their expectations do not match yours, so communicating your stance will be crucial. Practice negotiation skills to balance your needs with their wants.The best communication will continue on an ongoing basis before, during, and after the holiday season to ensure that your message is received. Focus your communication on being:ClearRespectfulBased on “I messages”SpecificPrepared rather than spontaneousShow WeaknessA great deal of stress develops when your presentation does not match your feelings. Acting like you are carefree when you actually have high levels of worry, anxiety, and fear is disingenuous, breeds stress, and damages relationships.Letting people know and understand your situation will allow them to assist to the best of their abilities. If you worry about being tearful or outwardly irritable, let the other people know what they can expect and what they can do to help.Two stressors make any situation more challenging, but it does not have to be impossible.

At first, I was reluctant to attend. I had little energy and was sick from surgery and chemotherapy. The last thing I wanted to do was meet more sick people – it sounded like it would be depressing. However, my oncologist thought that I would benefit from going to a meeting and so I went.Do I Have the Courage and Energy to Attend a Meeting?The group that I initially attended was for people who had all kinds of cancer. I felt overwhelmed when I went in. Some of the people there looked so sick. Frankly, it scared me.Then people started talking. And again I felt scared because some of the group members were facing cancer for their second and third time. That really freaked me out. Here I was, horribly ill from chemotherapy, and having to hear about the possibility that this terrible disease might come back! I wanted to run away and never go back.But I did go back, at the urging of family and my health care team. One of my co-workers had cancer a year before I did and she said that she felt like people in the support group understood how she felt better than people who had never been diagnosed with the disease. That made sense to me. It also helped that she attended the next meetings with me.Sharing is CaringI did find the support group helpful. My co-worker was right, the people in the group did “get it” about the emotional roller coaster ride. They also understood how terrible the side effects of treatment made me feel.However, if that had been all I gained from the group I don’t think I would have continued going. But I found that other cancer overcomers (I dislike the term “survivors”) were generous and caring. They offered practical advice for controlling symptoms of the ever-present nausea.I learned how to navigate the health care system better with their help than I had while working as a nurse. The support group helped me to understand what clinical trials are. I discussed this with my oncologist and was able to participate in a trial.Help For the Whole FamilyOne of the greatest benefits was the strain that it took off of my family. I was young when I was diagnosed with cancer. I was a mom, full-time nurse, and full-time student. My family was not used to me being ill, teary and helpless. My husband and I had no idea how we would manage financially or even how to get me back and forth to the hospital for treatments.By joining the support group, I learned about the community resources that were available to me, including a food shelf, medical transportation volunteers and programs that helped us to pay for utilities.My children linked up with other children whose parents were going through treatment too. It gave them a forum for sharing their own fears.Support Groups Are EmpoweringI found that the members of the cancer support group were strong in many ways. They recognized that each person had to follow the treatment and life path they thought best, but they held me accountable for how I dealt with the challenges cancer presented.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungCancer Immunotherapy TreatmentTreat Metastatic Breast CancerKidney Cancers Treatments You May Also LikeWhy Does Cancer Cause Weight Loss?Living With CancerWhy Does Cancer Cause Weight Loss?9 years ago| by Meredith CrowhurstDealing with cancer and weight loss, called cachexia, is a real issue for 50–85 percent of cancer sufferers. Read on to learn how to manage the condition.When you are home alone, crying that you have a terrible diagnosis, it is only natural to feel sorry for yourself and wonder, “Why me?” When you are sitting in a room full of people who have cancer it is harder to feel sorry for yourself. I found myself developing an attitude of, “Well if she can get through this, so can I.” Despite my illness, I realized that I could help others with just a hug or kind word.Different Kinds of Cancer Support GroupsAttending a cancer support group is likely not at all what you think it will be like. You will witness heartbreak, absolute joy, laughter, and camaraderie. Some groups sponsor activities like dinners. The first dinner that I attended made me nauseous, but the support made it worth it.Support groups are sometimes formed to address specific kinds of cancer. You can learn a great deal about your disease in any support group, however, ones that address your specific type of cancer are usually the best ones to attend if you are looking for information.Support groups sometimes invite speakers to attend meetings. They may be experts in cancer treatment, nutritionists, or alternative medicine practitioners. You don’t just learn about cancer. You can learn how to live life well.Nourishing the SpiritFor many people, attending a support group has a spiritual component. It is an important, often overlooked, aspect of healing from cancer.Doctors and health care experts are often so focused on blood counts, managing side effects, medications, and other treatments that they overlook the impact that cancer has on your mind, body, and spirit.I think most of the time it’s not that health care workers are unkind, it is simply that they are focused on destroying the cancer and saving lives. Support groups help cancer overcomers create new, better lives for themselves.Find the Right Fit For YouNot every support group is best for everyone. If you attend one and it doesn’t feel right for you, try another one. All support groups have a variety of attendees. Avoid groups that claim they have “the “answer.” Many groups have one or two members who think that their way or their doctor is “the answer” to cancer.Remember that every person and every cancer is different. Just because three people have stage three breast cancer does not mean that the cancers are alike.Focus on Lasting WellnessBeing a member of a cancer support group made me gain a confidence in myself that I had not experienced so strongly even before I was diagnosed. It made me kinder, more patient, and a better nurse. I learned to appreciate each moment and fret less over small things. I enjoy life more now. I feel less self-conscious about being silly and playful.Having cancer stinks. Joining a support group can provide you with tools to make it less isolating and more tolerable. You’ll develop relationships and tools to help make your life after cancer more meaningful and satisfying than it was before you had the disease.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer PreventionPrevent Breast Cancer in Your ChildrenCancer SymptomsSwelling and Discomfort: What Other Symptoms Indicate SarcomaCancer AwarenessDoes Talcum Powder Causes Ovarian Cancer?Cancer AwarenessLung Cancer and Smoking: The Best Reason to Quit SmokingCancer AwarenessUnderstanding and Battling Uterine and Endometrial CancerCancer PreventionWhy Catching Cancer Early Is so Importantyou may also likeLiving With CancerCoping with CancerLiving With CancerHow to Cope When a Loved One Has CancerLiving With Cancer9 Celebrities Who Have Battled CancerLiving With CancerYoga for Cancer Patients: Improving Your Outlook, Immunity and Abilityconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Some cancers are not easily identified, whereas others, such as skin cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer and oral cancer, can be identified fairly easily if you know what to look for.Skin CancerThe Skin Cancer Foundation recommends that a head-to-toe self-examination be done monthly. Follow the steps outlined below to perform a self-exam:Examine your face closely. Pay close attention to your ears, nose, lips and mouth. Use a hand mirror to get a closer look.Inspect the scalp carefully. Use a blow dryer with a mirror or a friend in order to view all areas of the scalp effectively.Examine the hands. Make sure to examine in between the fingers, your palms, and under the fingernails. Next move to the wrists and the forearms, front and back.Examine all surfaces of the arms. Use a full-length mirror so you can see every angle.View the chest, neck and torso. Do not forget to lift the breasts to view the undersides.Check your back. Using a hand-held mirror and the full-length mirror, stand with your back to the full-length mirror and examine the back, neck, and shoulders.Continuing in the same position, scan lower legs, buttocks and lower back.Sitting down, use a mirror to examine the genitals. Examine each leg — check the front and back, thigh and shin, ankles and feet.Should you find any freckle or bump that is suspicious, it is helpful to know your ABCDEs:Asymmetry – the freckle is not symmetrical.Border – the border is irregular.Color – the color varies or has shades of tan, brown or black, sometimes white, red or blue.Diameter – a melanoma is typically greater than 6mm.Evolving – a mole that looks different than the rest or is changing in shape, color or size.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungBreast Cancer HelpTypes of Breast Cancer ChemoTreat Advanced Breast Cancer You May Also Like9 Things You Can Do to Prevent MelanomaCancer Prevention9 Things You Can Do to Prevent Melanoma8 years ago| by Angie FinlayHere are some ways to prevent melanoma, and what you can do to make sure any skin problems don’t grow into life-threatening situations.Breast CancerThe National Breast Cancer Foundation recommends performing a self-exam of the breasts monthly. According to Johns Hopkins Medical center, “Forty percent of breast cancers are detected by women who feel a lump, so establishing a regular breast self-exam is very important.”The steps for a breast self-exam are as follows:In the shower, use the pads of the fingers and move around the entire breast in a circular pattern from the outside to the center. Include the armpit area. Check both breasts. Note any lumps, thickening or hardened knots.In front of a mirror, visually inspect your breasts. First keep your hands at your sides, then raise them over your head. Notice any changes in contour, swelling, dimpling of the skin, or changes in the nipples. Place hands on the hips, flexing chest muscles. Look for dimpling and puckering.While lying down, place a pillow behind the right shoulder and the right arm behind the head. Using the left hand, move the fingers around the breast in a circular motion. Use light, medium and firm pressure. Squeeze the nipple to check for discharge. Repeat on the other breast.Testicular CancerAccording to the Testicular Cancer Society, testicular self-exams should be performed monthly. They note that men find most testicular cancers during a self-exam or by their partner, not by their physician, so doing the exam is important.The steps for performing a self-exam can be followed below:After a warm bath or shower, when the scrotum is relaxed, stand in front of a mirror. Note any swelling of the scrotal skin.Examine each testicle with both hands. Place the thumb on the top of the testicle and the index finger and middle finger under the testicle; firmly but gently, roll the testicle between your fingers. Note any irregularities.Find the epididymis, a rope-like structure on the back of the testicle. It is important to identify this structure so it is not falsely identified as a lump.Repeat the steps on the other testicle.Oral CancerThe American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons recommends performing an oral cancer self-exam monthly. Doing so can detect cancer in the early stages; oral cancer typically has a high mortality — because it is often diagnosed in the later stages. It is estimated that 42,000 Americans will be diagnosed with oral or pharyngeal cancer this year.The steps for performing an oral exam can be found below:Remove any dentures that may be present.Look into the mouth — check and feel inside the lips and the front of the gums.Tilting the head back, examine and feel the roof of the mouth.Pull the cheeks out to visualize the inner surface and the back of the gums.Pull out the tongue; look at all surfaces.Feel for any lumps or enlarged lymph nodes in the neck.What to look for:Leukoplakia (white patches of the oral tissue)Erythroplakia (red patches)Erythroleukoplakia (red and white patches)A sore throat that does not heal and bleedsAbnormal lump of the mouth and/or neckHoarsenessDifficulty chewing or swallowingShould you note anything of concern while performing any of these monthly self-exams, please contact your physician.ResourcesAmerican Academy of Dermatology (What to Look for: ABCDEs of Melanoma)American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (Head, Neck and Oral Pathology)National Breast Cancer Foundation (Breast Self-Exam)Skin Cancer Foundation (Step by Step Self-Examination)Testicular Cancer Society (Testicular Self Exam)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer TreatmentsHow Stem Cell Transplants Are Used for Cancer PatientsCancer Symptoms9 Warning Signs of Liver CancerCancer AwarenessRisk Factors and Causes of Hodgkin LymphomaCancer AwarenessWhat You Should Know About Cancer in ChildrenCancer AwarenessUnderstanding How Cancerous Tumors FormCancer SymptomsSwelling and Discomfort: What Other Symptoms Indicate Sarcomayou may also likeCancer Prevention10 Things You Can Do to Prevent Skin CancerCancer PreventionPrevent Breast Cancer in Your ChildrenCancer PreventionWhy Catching Cancer Early Is so ImportantCancer PreventionFive Ways to Reduce Your Prostate Cancer Riskconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Journaling for Cancer PatientsFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail9 years ago| by Eric Patterson Photo Credit: petrograd99 / istockphoto.comJournaling for CancerCancer is a powerful force. When it enters your life, you have to call on all of your trusted coping skills to deal with the physical and psychological stresses that result.You may be working on improving your diet and sleep, trying to exercise, and spending more time with loved ones, but your current coping skills still may not offer enough.If they come up short, you will be left feeling increasingly anxious, depressed, hopeless, frustrated and fearful. Without the best types of positive coping skills, you will be more likely to seek the comfort of negative coping skills. Negative coping skills are only focused on short term benefit while sacrificing long-term gains.A fantastic positive coping skill that is not done often enough is journaling. Especially for someone undergoing cancer treatment, journaling offers much in the way of benefits, with very few risks. The process is 100% controlled by you so you do not have to depend on others to facilitate.If you aren’t sure about the good that can come from journaling, take some time to consider what journaling can do and how you can become a success at it.Why Journaling?Whenever people hear journaling, they think it’s only a self-indulgent behavior that 12-year-old girls use to keep secrets about boys. Sure, this is part of journaling, but it can be so much more for you. Put aside those faulty notions for a clear understanding of what journaling can do.The most important thing that journaling creates is an outlet for you to express yourself. Right now, you probably have innumerable thoughts swirling through your mind. You’re probably pretty sure that your head is going to explode off your neck. Journaling can help release the tension.Journaling gives you the opportunity to blow off steam in a safe, productive way. This ability to “get it all out” will free up room so that you can accept new information and feelings without being entirely overwhelmed. Journaling gives you a forum that is free from judgment and opinions of other people. You can write whatever you want, however you want. There is a sense of complete freedom that is hard to find ordinarily. You can curse God, life or the universe on the pages of your journal and no one has to see it.Another great pro of journaling is its ability to help you process your thoughts and feelings. Having cancer is anything but simple. It creates such a mix of emotions like fear, anger, worry, shock, sadness and guilt. The emotions are paired with thoughts about people’s response to you, your doctors’ level of commitment to you and disappointment in your current state. It can be hard to know what to think and how to feel.Journaling lets you free your thoughts and feelings from the prison of your mind. Seeing them in black and white helps to understand your triggers, judgments, and biases, which gives you the chance to rework your thinking to arrive at a new conclusion if you are not satisfied with the outcomes. Journaling lets you see your thoughts and feelings as things that are more flexible and fluid than you may have previously considered.During this process, you become better able to express your needs to others. During your diagnosis and treatment, it will be uncomfortable to constantly ask people for assistance. You might not even know what you need or what will make you feel better mentally or physically. This process is still new to you. By journaling, you can learn ways to communicate more effectively to the people around you. The pages of your journal give you the opportunity to engage in trial and error of effective communication. If you are having trouble speaking to someone in your life, write it in your journal to refine your message before deciding to say it out loud.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungKidney Cancer MedicationsLung Cancer ImmunotherapyTreat Advanced Breast Cancer You May Also LikeThe Power of Essential Oils for Cancer PatientsLiving With CancerThe Power of Essential Oils for Cancer Patients6 years ago| by Katrina HodginsSome of the best essential oils for cancer patients are frankincense, clary sage, lavender, citrus oils, lemongrass, myrrh, peppermint, and spearmint.As if the previous benefits of journaling weren’t enough, consider that journaling also allows you to know yourself. Knowing yourself is one the best ways to combat depression, anxiety or any other mental health concern that accompanies your cancer diagnosis and treatment. When you journal, you begin to connect the dots of your life. You find patterns and trends with your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in ways that you never have previously. You can see how your past influences your present. Knowing yourself allows you to prevent problems before they develop and to look for the solutions that you employed in the past.Of course, you can never prevent all problems from surfacing. Journaling allows you to solve problems because journaling allows you to be objective to yourself and the world around you. It gives you the power to solve new problems better than ever before. You can look at yourself with increased accuracy, and you can understand the people around you with more empathy.Empathy is the act of putting yourself in someone else’s shoes to know what it’s like to be them. Empathy is essential for conflict resolution, and it is something that tends to diminish during treatment because more of your energies are focused on you.Too many people think that journaling is only set in the past. A really interesting method to journaling is having it focused on your goals for the future. What do you want to work on? Many people fail to complete goals because they lack the needed consistency. For you, your diagnosis or treatment may have you questioning many aspects of your life and the direction you are headed. You can process the reasons why today did not go as planned and create a new strategy for tomorrow. Without goals, you become at risk for getting stuck and being stagnant. Accomplishing goals gives you a sense of purpose and direction that make life more satisfying.How to JournalBeginning something is much different than being consistent with it. To make journaling successful, treat it like exercise. Going from no exercise to constant exercise is too taxing on your body and your mind. Ease yourself into journaling by experimenting a few times a week. Limit yourself to 10 – 15 minutes a day until you develop a level of comfort.When and where you journal has a strong bearing on success. Try to journal at night in an attempt to reflect on the day, but be flexible if this does not work for you. The bedroom seems like the natural spot to journal if there is enough privacy for you. If not, look elsewhere like outside, the bathroom or in the attic. There is no wrong time to journal or wrong place to do it.Your method of journaling has many options as well. Many opt for the simplicity of pen and paper, but don’t shy away from some 21st century options. Writing on a computer or tablet can assist in the flow of material from your fingers to the screen, while locking it away in a text document can ensure that no one ever finds it. You can even choose to forgo letters and words altogether by using art to convey your thoughts and feelings.Some people think that sharing their thoughts with the world via blog or social media is the best thing to do. Surely, communicating yourself to a large group has many pluses, but for journal writing, keep it confidential. The knowledge that people my read your writing changes the content in undesirable ways. You want the words to flow from you without any filters that comes from worry about the perceptions of others.The truth is that journaling can be whatever you want it to be. As long as you do it with consistency and you find ways to gain from it, the process is worthwhile. Avoid thoughts of beginning your journal when life settles down. When life if crazy, hectic and confusing, you need journaling the most. Adding another coping skill is always a good idea.Today, turn an ordinary notebook into an extraordinary journal.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer AwarenessBenign vs. Malignant Tumors: Understanding the DifferenceCancer AwarenessMetastatic Cancer: Why Cancer SpreadsCancer SymptomsThe Silent Nine Signs of a Brain TumorCancer AwarenessWhy Is Cancer Becoming More Common?Cancer SymptomsSymptoms of Pancreatic CancerCancer AwarenessAre Skin Tags a Sign of Skin Cancer?you may also likeLiving With CancerHow to Cope When a Loved One Has CancerLiving With CancerGoing Through Cancer While PregnantLiving With CancerPregnancy and CancerLiving With CancerDepression, Anxiety, Stress and Cancerconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

They will readily process and accept the information about the condition, the prognosis, and the treatment without any ill effects or significant impact on their life.The days after their diagnosis will look remarkably like the days prior to their diagnosis as they do well mentally and physically. These people will be the small minority of all people with a cancer diagnosis.The vast majority of people will experience a monumental shift in their mental and physical functioning, and for good reason: cancer creates effects on your body that are direct and negative. The treatments can do the same as they often result in weakness, fatigue, clouded thinking, and nausea.The unwanted impacts don’t end there, though. As people deal with the negative consequences to their physical functioning, they are confronted with massive amounts of stress and tension due to the indirect effects of cancer.A cancer diagnosis carries huge amounts of emotional weight. Everyone seems to know a life that has been affected by cancer. First-hand or by word of mouth, they have noted the destruction done, and it’s scary.Fear, stress, and tension grow like weeds in a garden. They may start out as small and manageable, but as time goes on, it becomes more time consuming and complicated to pull them out.If positive supports and optimism are the flowers and vegetables you intended to grow in your garden, the weeds will push them out. Before long, your garden will be full only of weeds.Depression as a WeedDepression in people with cancer is quite common and very understandable. As many as 25 percent of all people with cancer will develop a type of depression, but it can be hard to diagnosis.Symptoms of depression include:Low mood or irritabilityLow motivationLow energyChanged sleepWeight lossIncreased feelings of worthlessness or guiltThoughts of deathProblems with concentration and making choicesWhile looking at the list, it is easy to see how cancer and cancer treatments may overlap with symptoms of depression, but depression will be longer lasting, more intense, and more pervasive than feelings of sadness. If the feelings are present more often than not for two weeks, it could likely be depression.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungBreast Cancer HelpKidney Cancer MedicationsKidney Cancers Treatments You May Also LikePregnancy and CancerLiving With CancerPregnancy and Cancer9 years ago| by Angie FinlayLet's take a look at some of the dangers and risks of pregnancy and cancer. It can be scary, but there are some treatment options and things to know.Anxiety as a WeedDepression is not the only outcome of these weeds in your garden. Anxiety is another option, and it can present as a low-grade, ever-present anxiety, an intense but fleeting anxiety, and variations between.The ever-present version is called generalized anxiety, with symptoms like:Intense and excessive worryFeeling restlessProblems with focusBeing irritablePoor sleepFeeling physically tense and unable to relaxPeople with a cancer diagnosis might spend huge amounts of time worrying about their future, their ability to continue working, their children, and other stressors. This worry can consume aspects of their life and lessen their ability to function as high levels.The intense periods of anxiety may develop into panic attacks. Panic attacks are periods of high anxiety that last for less than 10 minutes usually. They will be marked by:Pounding heartShortness of breath or feelings of chokingBeing lightheaded, numb, or dizzyFeeling very hot or coldFear that you are dying or losing control of yourselfThese panic attacks can occur with or without the generalized anxiety. Additionally, it is possible that a person dealing with cancer can have depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.Pulling the WeedsIt may seem like depression, anxiety, and panic are too many obstacles to overcome — too many weeds to pull. The task might seem daunting, but taking care of your mental health will leave you with more resources to care for your physical health. If your physical health can improve, the weeds might not grow back.When beginning the process of cleaning out the garden, it will be essential to use your time and energy wisely as they are in limited supply. Avoiding negative coping skills that seem positive will be a good starting point.If you don’t want to add to your stress, stop:Ignoring the problem, hoping it will go away. Higher levels of stress rarely alleviate without work.Lying to others by telling them you are okay. It is not fair to them or you.Believing what you feel is bad or wrong. It is not a failure on your part that you are experiencing these symptoms.Relying on alcohol or other drugs to reduce your symptoms. Self-medication never improves symptoms — it only adds more problems.Thinking things will never get better. Pessimism only makes situations seem worse.Avoiding the negatives will help with you depression, anxiety, and panic, but to get the kind of success you are looking for, you must take active steps. If you want to reduce your stress, start:Setting aside time each day to think about your thoughts, pay attention to your feelings, and observe your behaviors. Even if the results are uncomfortable, they will move you forward.Talking to trusted friends, family members, and coworkers about how you feel and what you are thinking. Seek out those with a good history of being nonjudgmental to have your feelings validated.Balancing time alone with time with others. Being alone is necessary at times, especially when enduring a cancer diagnosis — but too much can be lonely and isolating.Focusing on your physical health.

Pancreatic cancer accounts for 3 percent of the of all cancers and 7 percent of cancer mortality.This particular cancer has claimed the lives of numerous famous names, including Steve Jobs and Patrick Swayze.Pancreatic cancer often goes undetected until it is in an advanced stage when is too difficult to treat. Unfortunately, most of the time, symptoms only develop after the cancer has spread.Signs and SymptomsMost people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are already at a late stage by the time the disease is detected, and by that point, the prognosis could mean death for some people.While there are early signs, these often go undetected because they could mean anything. But if you find you are experiencing two or more early warning signs, call your doctor and ask for testing.Some of the early warning signs of pancreatic cancer are listed below.Diabetes That Suddenly Comes OnDiabetes is either a symptom of pancreatic cancer or a risk factor. People have had diabetes for a long time have a higher chance of developing this type of cancer.In individuals who have had diabetes for shorter periods, the research is unclear as to whether diabetes contributed to cancer or whether pre-cancer cells caused diabetes.New onset diabetes may be any early symptom of pancreatic cancer in people over 50, this according to a 2009 report in the journal, The Lancet Oncology. A sudden change in blood sugar in people with diabetes that was previously well-controlled is also a sign of pancreatic cancer.JaundiceJaundice, the yellowing of skin and eyes, is common in people with pancreatic cancer. It is due to excess bilirubin – a bile compound – in the blood.Tumors at the top of the pancreas case the bile duct to narrow and block the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the small intestine. That blockage is what causes the buildup of bilirubin.Signs of jaundice are:Skin irritation and itchinessDark urineLight or clay color stoolsA surgical procedure called a biliary bypass can clear the blocked bile duct. Another treatment option for jaundice involves insertion of a stent to open and keep the bile duct open.Abnormal BloatingBloating in pancreatic cancer is the result of the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, a condition called ascites. That extra fluid is what causes the abdominal bloating.In addition to bloating, ascites can cause other symptoms may include:Breathing difficultiesAbdominal pain and pressureWeight gainDigestive issues, including nausea, ingestion, and constipationFatigueAnkle swellingThe most effective treatment for ascites is a treatment of the tumor with chemotherapy or surgery. Diuretics (water pill) can help to slow down the buildup because they cause the kidneys to expel more water into the urine.In very severe cases, the fluid is drained by inserting a needle into the abdominal cavity and slowly draining the fluid. This treatment helps temporarily, but the excess fluid will return.Enlarged GallbladderIf a tumor is blocking the bile duct and causing build up to the gallbladder, the gallbladder can become enlarged. A doctor can feel this enlargement as a large lump on the right side of the rib cage. This can also be seen on an imaging test, such as at CT scan.Pancreatic cancer can also cause the liver to become enlarged. But this usually more frequent if the cancer has spread to the liver.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungCancer Immunotherapy TreatmentTreat Metastatic Breast CancerLiver Cancer Survival Rates You May Also LikeThe 4 Most Common Types of Breast CancerCancer SymptomsThe 4 Most Common Types of Breast Cancer4 years ago| by Shaina McQuilkieBreast cancer is a disease that affects the breast tissue. There are four main types of breast cancer and here you'll learn about the different symptoms.PainPain results when tumors invade the nerves. With pancreatic cancer, pain is often felt in the stomach or the back.This type of pain worsens with eating, laying down and bending forward. Pain is more common when the cancer is in the main body or the bottom part of the pancreas.Your abdomen may be tender or painful if your liver, gallbladder or pancreases are enlarged and/or inflamed.FatigueCancer fatigue is not just simply being tired. It is extreme exhaustion on an almost daily basis.Sometimes, cancer fatigue comes on suddenly and for no reason. This type of fatigue makes you weak, causes sleep problems and makes it difficult to concentrate.Fatigue it is also caused by cancer treatments. It may get worse during treatment and may go on long after treatment has completed.Your doctor can help you to find the best ways to manage fatigue. But he or she cannot help if you do not disclose your fatigue struggles and how they are affecting you daily.Digestive ProblemsDigestive issues associated with pancreatic cancer include:Nausea and vomitingWeight lossLoss of appetiteChanges to tasteThe cause of nausea and vomiting is usually a blocked duodenum. The duodenum is the upper part of the small intestine.Weight loss results from loss of appetite and malabsorption of fats due to a reduced supply of pancreatic enzymes. Changes to taste have also been noted in people with pancreatic cancer.Unusual StoolsPancreatic tumors keep digestive enzymes from reaching the intestine resulting in the ability to digest fatty foods. Stools become loose, smelly and float because of this excessive fat.Bleeding in the upper intestines may cause dark, tar-like stools.Unusual stools are usually the first signs of pancreatic cancer, but this is also the most overlooked symptom.What to Do If You Experience These Symptoms?The symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often mistaken for more common and less severe conditions. Therefore, it is important to document all symptoms and report them to your doctor.If your doctor thinks your concerns are real and concerning, he or she will order imaging tests and blood work.It is possible you may have to convince your doctor that your concerns are legitimate. If he or she is not willing to listen, find a doctor who will, but most doctors will do what the patient asks.Plenty of people still living productive lives due to the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at an early stage. Don’t push your health concerns aside and don’t let anyone else do that either, including medical professionals.ResourcesAmerican Cancer Society (Key Statistics for Pancreatic Cancer)American Cancer Society (Signs and Symptoms of Pancreatic Cancer)National Institutes of Health (New-onset Diabetes: A Potential Clue to the Early Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer)Mayo Clinic (Pancreatic Cancer: Signs and Symptoms)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsLiving With CancerChemotherapy and Coping With Hair LossCancer PreventionWhy Catching Cancer Early Is so ImportantCancer TreatmentsColon Cancer Treatment PlansLiving With CancerThe Power of Essential Oils for Cancer PatientsCancer AwarenessColon Cancer: Symptoms, Screening, and Prevention TipsLiving With CancerWhat is Hospice?you may also likeCancer SymptomsKnowing the Signs of Hodgkin’s LymphomaCancer SymptomsRecognizing the Symptoms of a Carcinoid TumorCancer SymptomsThe Silent Nine Signs of a Brain TumorCancer Symptoms9 Warning Signs of Ovarian Cancerconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

FibromyalgiaLiving.todayMenuFibro FactsFibro LivingBlogSearchSearch HRT can help to reduce hot flashes, improve sleep and regulate your mood. Can Hormone Replacement Therapy Help with Fibromyalgia?FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail4 years ago| by Natalie Saunders Fibromyalgia and Hormone Replacement TherapyFibromyalgia affects far more women than men. This fact has led many people to wonder whether hormones play a part in the development of this painful condition. If so, it seems logical that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) could help, but is there any truth to this theory?In this article we look at the relationship between fibromyalgia and hormones, and whether HRT could help.Can Hormone Replacement Therapy Help Fibromyalgia?As many as 80-90% of people with fibromyalgia are women. Furthermore, the condition is often diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 50, a period which coincides with the onset of menopause.Many of the symptoms of fibromyalgia are also similar to those of the menopause. These symptoms include:Stiffness, aches and painsPoor sleepDaytime fatigueMood changesDifficulty with concentration and memoryThis has led many people to speculate that hormonal changes could play a role in the development of fibromyalgia. It has also led scientists to wonder whether HRT could help.The current evidence for using HRT to treat fibromyalgia is inconclusive. One study found that treatment with estrogen-based HRT did not lead to any improvements in fibromyalgia pain. However, the authors state that HRT could help with other symptoms such as sleep, vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot flashes), mood and overall quality of life.Another study found that hormonal treatment does offer pain relief to fibromyalgia patients. However, the hormone used in the study was testosterone rather than estrogen. The study found that using testosterone as a gel significantly reduced pain and the sensitivity of tender points.To explain the results of these two studies, let’s look at the link between hormones and fibromyalgia.The Relationship between Hormones and FibromyalgiaIt is still unclear why some people develop fibromyalgia, but it is thought to be due to an imbalance in the body’s pain processing system. Pain is controlled by a complex interaction between nerve cells, hormones and other chemicals. If any of these factors is thrown out of harmony, pain can occur.In terms of hormones, it seems that testosterone and progesterone have the most significant impact on pain. Increased levels of both of these hormones are associated with decreases in pain. Estrogen appears to play a less significant role. However, estrogen does have a close relationship with serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is often decreased in fibromyalgia patients.The exact relationship between hormones and fibromyalgia is yet to be fully established. However, what we do know is that men with the condition tend to report less pain than women, suggesting that hormones do play a role.It also seems that fibromyalgia may make menopausal symptoms worse. One study found that of the post-menopausal women who experienced symptoms, 29% were also diagnosed with fibromyalgia. In comparison, only 4% of the women without symptoms had a fibromyalgia diagnosis.Fibromyalgia and Hormone Replacement Therapy BenefitsThere are many different types of HRT. Some contain estrogen alone while others contain estrogen combined with progesterone. These medications are available as tablets, patches, or topical creams and gels.Related Search Topics RA & Fibromyalgia TreatmentsFibro Headache TreatmentsFibromyalgia Treatment CentersSevere Fibro Pain Relief You May Also LikeThe Fog of FibromyalgiaBlogThe Fog of Fibromyalgia9 years ago| by Barbara LeechThe fog began slowly. I missed an appointment. I forgot someone’s name. I put it down to fatigue, stress, and getting older. But the fog progressed.Although research suggests that estrogen-based HRT probably does not help with fibromyalgia pain, it could still have several benefits. HRT can help to reduce hot flashes, improve sleep and regulate your mood.If you are suffering from fibromyalgia, the last thing you need is menopause symptoms on top, so this could be a real plus. Women who take HRT may also experience improvements in their energy levels and sex drive.Another benefit of HRT is that it could help reduce the risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. These conditions are more common after menopause due to decreases in estrogen levels. However, these benefits need to weighed carefully against the risks.Fibromyalgia and Hormone Replacement Therapy RisksThere are certain risks associated with taking HRT, especially if you take it for a long time. Women who take HRT for longer than a year may have an increased risk of breast cancer, and possibly a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer.Estrogen-only HRT is associated with an increased risk of uterine (womb) cancer, although combined HRT reduces this risk. Therefore, medication containing both estrogen and progesterone is usually recommended, unless you have had a hysterectomy.Another possible risk of HRT is an increased chance of developing blood clots. However, menopausal women are at very low risk of this problem, so it is not considered a major concern.Finally, estrogen-only HRT can slightly increase the risk of having a stroke, but again, the risk is still relatively low.Aside from these risks, taking HRT can cause several other side effects. Although most of these are not serious, they can be annoying nonetheless.The side effects of HRT include:BloatingBreast tendernessNauseaLeg crampsHeadaches and migrainesIndigestionVaginal bleedingMood swings or depressionThese side effects will vary depending on which type of HRT you take. They are less likely to occur if you use patches or topical creams.Fibromyalgia and Hormone Replacement Therapy: The Bottom LineIf you are thinking about using HRT to treat fibromyalgia, you will need to decide whether the potential benefits outweigh the risks. You also need to consider which symptoms you are hoping to relieve.If you want to treat your sleep, anxiety or menopausal symptoms, HRT could help. However, if you are looking for pain relief, other medications may be more beneficial.

It’s not a big deal for most people; you disinfect, slap on a bandage and keep going about your day. Small injuries are a minor inconvenience because your blood will clot and scab over pretty quickly—unless you have ITP. In this article we explain what ITP is, what the common symptoms are, and we also review ITP treatment.What Is ITP?Immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease that targets your blood platelets—the cells that clump together to help your blood clot. The immune system marks the platelets as foreign invaders and they are eliminated by the spleen (sometimes the liver helps out too). There are some cases where platelet production is impaired in addition to the platelets being destroyed, causing the platelet count to plummet. ITP can lead to bruising and bleeding that happens easily and excessively because there are not enough platelets available to slow the bleeding.How Many Platelets Should You Have?Platelets (also known as thrombocytes) are colorless, disc-shaped cells in our blood that help in blood clotting and aid in the structure of blood vessel walls. A normal platelet count ranges from about 140,000 to 440,000 per microliter of blood. A patient is considered to have low platelets if they have less than 140,000. ITP is an unusually lower number of platelets; less than 100,000 might be considered ITP, but the condition needs to be diagnosed by a doctor.Causes of ITPAs an autoimmune disease, ITP occurs when the immune system incorrectly identifies platelets as an invader, causing it to attack these blood cells. ITP is not a genetic disease; if a family member has ITP, your risk of getting ITP does not increase. It appears that ITP is generally triggered by another infection:In children, it usually occurs after a viral illness, such as the flu.In adults, it may be triggered by an infection with HIV, hepatitis, or H. pylori.As far as risk groups, ITP is more common with young women. Risk seems to increase with individuals who have other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome.Symptoms of ITPDepending on the severity of ITP, symptoms may look like:Spontaneous or excessive bruisingPinpoint-sized dots that are red-purple in color and look like a rashBleeding from the gums or noseBlood in urine or stoolsUnusually heavy menstrual flowBlood blisters on the inside of the cheeksThe Difference of ITP in Children and AdultsChildren who get ITP generally make a full recovery without treatment. The reason this happens is because their bodies usually stop making the antibodies that attack the platelets, so the condition resolves on its own. In adults, the prognosis is different since ITP in adulthood is often long term, requiring a treatment plan to be manageable.What to Do When a Child Has ITPChildren’s bodies usually self-correct over time and their bodies stop producing the platelet antibodies. In the meantime, the goal of treatment in children is to keep their platelets in a safe range until these antibodies disappear. While children generally do not require treatment, you need to take some precautions to try and prevent injuries and bleeding. There are some tips that can help manage the condition:Keeping your doctor informed of your child’s condition and discuss any limitations or recommended safety measures.Making sure that the environment is safe by padding areas or having your child wear protective clothing and gear.Restricting certain activities that pose danger, including contact sports.Being informed of all your child’s medication. Some medication, including over the counter medicine, may affect the body’s ability to control bleeding. If you are unsure of any consequences of medication, speak with a pharmacist or doctor.Related Search Topics What Is Kidney CancerKidney Cancer SymptomsWhat Is Liver CancerShingles Symptoms You May Also LikeDifferent Types of Symptoms That Could Indicate Cystic FibrosisAll AgesDifferent Types of Symptoms That Could Indicate Cystic Fibrosis5 years ago| by Sheree McDonaldSome cystic fibrosis symptoms are seen in young children, but others aren't. It's important to understand what to look for in order to get a diagnosis.How to Treat ITPThere is not a cure for ITP, but following a doctor-recommended treatment plan usually improves blood platelet count. Treatments vary depending on your platelet count and personal health status.Regular Monitoring and Platelet ChecksIn mild cases, it is just a matter of making sure your numbers and general health are in good working order. Ongoing check-ins help ensure that your ITP is under control.Platelet-boosting MedicationsThere are a variety of drugs that your doctor may recommend. Usually an oral corticosteroid helps improve your platelet count by slowing the rate of platelet destruction, but steroids are not recommended for long-term use. Your doctor may give an injection of immune globulin, or prescribe other drugs, such as romiplostim and eltrombopag to assist the bone marrow in platelet production.SplenectomyThis is a surgery to remove the spleen. The spleen destroys blood platelets in the body, so getting rid of this organ should improve your platelet count. Unfortunately, a splenectomy is not a guaranteed fix and there are other side effects, such as permanently making your body more susceptible to infection.Platelet Concentrate TransfusionIn cases where emergency treatment is needed and platelet levels crash, you may require a platelet transfusion. Platelets are given by infusion into a vein and the process takes less than a half hour, offering an increase of platelets right away.Hormone TherapyIn some cases of low platelets, doctors may prescribe hormones to teenage girls to stop their menstrual cycle. They do this because additional bleeding from menstruation may lower the platelet count in some patients.Some Warnings for People with ITPThere are a few tips for those who have ITP and how they need to protect themselves, including:Avoiding contact sports or other high-impact activities that may cause bleeding in the brain.Keeping an eye out for signs of infection following a splenectomy.Advising your doctor of any medications you are taking. Some non-prescription drugs may affect platelet function.Talk to Your DoctorITP can cause some pretty serious health issues if not treated. Make sure your platelet count is in a safe zone and see your doctor as often as required to keep the impact of ITP to a minimum.ResourcesStanford Health Care (Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP))Platelet Disorder Support Association (ITP Frequently Asked Questions)Mayo Clinic (Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP))MacMillan Cancer Support (Platelet Transfusions)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsGolden YearsWhat Is Osteoarthritis?Twenty-Something5 Ways to Practice Feminine HygieneSandwich GenerationTeething and Your Baby: When Does Teething Start?Empty Nester9 Warning Signs of a Heart Attack Women Shouldn’t IgnoreSandwich Generation5 Common Causes of Hair Loss in ChildrenEmpty NesterWhat Are the Signs of Sleep Apnea?you may also likeAll AgesWhen Physical Intimacy Hurts: What Causes Painful Intercourse?All AgesEverything You Need to Know About Muscle RelaxantsAll AgesWhy Excessive Sweating Happens and How to Deal With ItAll AgesHow to Bring Hydration Back to Your Dry Eyesconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsOur TeamContact UsHealthLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

While anxiety itself can be a normal part of life, it becomes an issue when it interferes with your ability to participate in regular activities. Understanding the link between anxiety and depression, as well as learning about the natural remedies to help you cope, can go a long way towards preserving your way of life. So, let’s take look at what your options are for natural remedies for anxiety and depression.What Are Anxiety and Depression?Anxiety is actually a normal part of life. If you have ever been particularly worried or stressed at a particular event, such as presenting to a large crowd, then you were most likely experiencing anxiety. However, anxiety can become a more significant issue if you do not find ways to cope with it. When anxiety becomes a concern, you may have the following symptoms:RestlessnessInability to concentratePanic attacksExcessive worrySweatingNervousnessDepression differs from anxiety but can develop with anxiety if it remains untreated. Depression can present itself in a variety of ways that include both physical and emotional symptoms. Essentially, depression is an overwhelming sense of sadness and hopelessness that makes it difficult to function in everyday life. Common symptoms include:SadnessChanges in sleep patternsFeeling worthlessChanges in appetiteLoss of interest in regular activitiesTypes of Natural Remedies for Anxiety and DepressionFortunately, there are a number of ways to treat both anxiety and depression. While some people may require medication or cognitive therapy, there are natural remedies that may also help.Create a ScheduleWhen anxiety and depression creep into your life, it can become very easy to waste away an entire day. Because your mind may be racing or creating a false narrative about yourself, it is always a good idea to create a schedule and routine.It may be as easy as mapping out your morning with a few simple tasks such as getting out of bed, showering and making breakfast. Setting up a schedule for yourself can help you stay on task rather than spending your days idle. Sometimes, a little bit of activity is what you need to help break up some of those anxious or negative thoughts.Maintain Proper Diet and ExerciseWhile there is no one diet or exercise routine that will cure anxiety and depression, research does show that they can both help relieve symptoms. Proper nutrition and adequate movement can go a long way toward ensuring that your body is being taken care of first and foremost.Related Search Topics Kidney Cancer SymptomsWhat Is Liver CancerShingles SymptomsTreatments for Depression You May Also LikeWhat Every Woman Needs to Know About EndometriosisTwenty-SomethingWhat Every Woman Needs to Know About Endometriosis5 years ago| by Shaina McQuilkieEndometriosis is a condition where the endometrium, the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus, grows outside of the uterus.Set GoalsSetting goals can be a positive influence on your life. That said, your goals do not have to be long-term or grand. In fact, it is a good idea to start with smaller goals that are easily achievable. The idea here is that achieving a goal will help you get into a more positive mindset, and then you can build from that momentum. The goal can be as simple as making the decision to get out of your pajamas or maybe finishing a homework assignment.Have a Proper Sleep ScheduleNever underestimate the value of proper rest. Lack of sleep can make it incredibly difficult to fight the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Ensure that you are getting plenty of rest so that your mind is capable of battling some of those negative thoughts and feelings. Most adults should have eight hours of sleep per night. If you are sleeping much less or way more than this, then this may be a problem. Track your sleep schedule to learn more about your sleeping patterns.Get Out of Your Comfort ZoneWe all have comfort zones that include people we know, activities we do regularly and a host of other factors that we are familiar with. However, sometimes, comfort zones can hold you back. If you want to mix things up a little bit, try meeting new people, try new things, or travel somewhere you have never been before. This slight change in your life can lead to big rewards. It has the potential to transform how you think and could have a positive influence that you need to tackle anxiety and depression.An OverviewAnxiety and depression are both serious mental health concerns. While there are a number of natural remedies that may work, there are no one-size-fits-all approach to tackling these issues. If you have already tried a few things listed here, then you may want to consult with your doctor to learn more about your options.The solution for anxiety and depression can be just as unique as the person who lives with it. Understanding the resources that are available to you can go a long way to helping you overcome these issues and live a happier and fuller life. If you suspect that you are living with anxiety and depression, then consult your doctor to learn more about your customized treatment plan.ResourcesAnxiety and Depression Association of America (Depression)American Psychiatric Association (What Is Depression?)WebMD (10 Natural Depression Treatments)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsAll AgesEight Effective Remedies to Help Soothe a Sore ThroatAll Ages8 Hair Removal Mistakes to AvoidAll AgesFive Self-Care Habits to Start in 2019All Ages5 Effective Breathing Exercises for Anxiety and Panic AttacksSandwich GenerationWhat to Know About HyperkalemiaAll AgesSix Weight Loss Tips That Will Help Burn Fat and Drop Poundsyou may also likeTwenty-SomethingDating When You or Your Partner are HIV-PositiveTwenty-Something9 DIY Acne Remedies to AvoidTwenty-SomethingUnderstanding the Goal of HIV Treatment and How It WorksTwenty-SomethingSigns that Point Towards Bacterial Vaginosis and How to Treat Itconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsOur TeamContact UsHealthLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Today, people can do their taxes, order a pizza, fall in love and buy a car, so it only seems natural that they can get therapy online, too.Online counselling is not necessarily new, but it is increasing in popularity, which leads to a number of changes with services shifting to keep up with demand. Although online counseling may not be right for everyone, for some it could be a much-needed support to improve their mental health and overall well-being.Online Counselling BasicsPeople new to the concept of online counselling may have a single notion of the practice and what it entails. In reality, online counselling covers a broad variety of services.Available versions of online therapy include:Text message therapy where a therapist in exchanging text messages with the clientPhone therapy with the individual speaking to a therapist over the phoneE-mail therapy with the therapist and client e-mailing each other at scheduled intervals or as needed based on symptomsVideo chatting through web-based apps like FaceTime or SkypeSome forms of online counselling will subscribe to only one of these services while others will employ all of the above to provide the most comprehensive care. The available communication methods will vary based on factors including the location of services, insurance payment and therapist preference.The idea of getting therapy at a distance is not new. For more than 20 years, the practice, sometimes referred to as telepsychology, has existed, but as smartphones became more capable, there was a higher demand for this form of therapy.The Benefits of Online CounsellingWhen it comes to online counselling, convenience is by far the most obvious benefit of the service. People have busy, over-scheduled lives, so having the ability to check in with a therapist during a free moment is fantastic. Before your morning coffee or after the kids are sleeping at night, you can have therapy from the comfort of your own home.After convenience, many people see privacy as a major benefit of online counselling. In the real world, a person must physically go into a building or therapist’s office to receive treatment, which could lead to embarrassment or awkward situations if you see someone you know.With online counselling, you barely have to leave your house. The added convenience and privacy are valuable because they lower the barriers of access to counseling. Some people who have intense symptoms or pervasive disorders may avoid treatment, but online counselling creates ease around the process.Another benefit is having access to a broader range of therapists with online counselling. Depending on your location, you may only have access to a handful of professionals, but with the internet, you can connect with therapists from every corner of the country.Related Search Topics Symptoms of Ovarian CancerLiver Spot TreatmentShingles SymptomsDiabetes Type 2 Symptoms You May Also LikeWhat You Need to Know About LupusAll AgesWhat You Need to Know About Lupus8 years ago| by Angie FinlayWhat is lupus?

Online counselling strips away much of the intimacy connected to the therapeutic process, as the counselor and client may never see each other.In some cases, this separation will have little effect on the therapy process, but in other situations, a therapist can gain tremendous insights by being in the same room with the client to observe how they look, interact with others and experience the world. Without direct contact, the therapy could be less effective.Another problem with online counseling involves the credentials of the therapist. Reliable sites will vet each professional to track their competency and try to reduce risk, but you may not actually know who you are communicating with or what their background is.Some other risks of online counseling include:Greater chance of miscommunicationThe increased likelihood of being distracted during sessionsThe challenging nature of trying to express feelings in wordsPotential lack of insurance coveragePotential privacy and confidentiality issues with unprotected servers or connected devicesIs Online Therapy Right for You?With a simple online search, a person can find plenty of online counselling options, but are any of these right for you? The answer really depends on your expectations and symptoms.People who may benefit from online counseling are people who:Are interested in entering treatment for the first timeHave had negative experiences with therapy in the pastHave mild mental health symptomsDo not need medications or are getting medications from another providerPeople who should avoid online counseling options include:Those with complex mental health, physical health and substance use disordersPeople with a history of self-injury, suicidal, or homicidal behaviorsThose who find it difficult to be honest with their therapistPeople who need to be connected to higher levels of care within their communityWith mental health services, no one treatment works for all people. Instead, people need to experiment with various options to find one that fits their needs. With a little open-mindedness and patience, online counseling could be best treatment option for you.ResourcesAmerican Psychological Association (A Growing Wave of Online Therapy)American Psychological Association (What You Need to Know Before Choosing Online Therapy)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsGolden YearsHow Can Elderly Prevent Falls?

Don’t Ignore These Subtle Heart Attack SignsFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail6 years ago| by Katrina Hodgins Signs of a Heart AttackAs you get older, you start to recognize that health, especially heart health, isn’t a guarantee. You become more aware of certain conditions and ailments and perhaps you wonder if you are at risk for a heart condition.If any pain occurs in your chest, your first instinct might be to assume that the pain is a heart attack, but what are the signs of a heart attack, and what should you do if it is one?What Happens During a Heart Attack?A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, happens when one or more of your coronary arteries become obstructed.When a roadblock pops up in your arteries, it causes an issue because there is no other route for oxygenated blood to get to the heart. Without this oxygen, the heart is unable to work properly, so it starts to shut down.Much like the brain, the longer the heart goes without oxygen, the worse the damage gets. Treatment needs to be immediate, otherwise, portions of the heart muscle begin to die. The damage spectrum ranges from mild to severe and heart attack damage isn’t an isolated incident – even a minor heart attack will affect you for the rest of your life.The Danger of Plaque BuildupYou may question what causes this blockage in the arteries. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation, more than 9 out of 10 heart attacks are caused by atherosclerosis. This is the buildup of waxy plaque on the interior wall of an artery over time.Plaque buildups are essentially deposits made of cholesterol, fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium, and a clotting material in the blood known as fibrin. The thicker the plaque buildup gets, the narrower the passage becomes for blood transportation.It would be like starting out with a spacious four-lane highway and changing it down to one lane. The buildup results in a blood clot which can become so large it obstructs the flow of blood to the heart. Atherosclerosis occurs over the course of many years.An area of plaque buildup can break open and cause a blood clot to form on the plaque’s surface, either completely or partially blocking blood flow.Heart Attack Risk FactorsThe makeup of plaque probably gives a pretty good idea for some of those at risk for a heart attack. If you suffer from any of the following, you need to start making your heart health a bigger priority:High blood pressureHigh blood cholesterolBeing overweight/obesityAn unhealthy dietLack of physical activityHigh blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetesSmoking also helps accelerate the plaque buildup and cause it to grow biggerOther factors are age – risk increases for men after 45 and women after 55, if there is a family history of heart disease, or preeclampsia (a condition that can develop during pregnancy where you see a rise in blood pressure or excess protein in the urine).Related Search Topics Kidney Cancer SymptomsSymptoms of Ovarian CancerLiver Spot TreatmentWhat Is Liver Cancer You May Also LikeEverything You Need to Know About ColonoscopyEmpty NesterEverything You Need to Know About Colonoscopy6 years ago| by Natalie SaundersA colonoscopy allows your physician to view the inside of your bowel and check for any issues such as inflammation or polyps.Heart Attack SymptomsHeed the warning from any heart attack symptoms. Symptoms range from mild to severe pain and anywhere from one symptom to several.The most common symptom is pressure, pain, or discomfort in the chest. Your chest may feel full, heavy, or have a burning sensation. There may be other aching sensations present in your upper body, most likely the neck, jaw, shoulders, arms, and back.Other symptoms include shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sweating, or nausea. Women and men perceive the signs differently, as women are more apt to cite other signs such as anxiety, indigestion, or back pain as one of the first signs.What to Do During a Heart AttackIf an attack happens to you, get somebody to call 9-1-1 immediately. It is recommended that you stop any activity and either sit or lie down depending on which is most comfortable for you.During a heart attack, you will still be responsive; the heart still beats, and blood still circulates so CPR is not required. It is a different story if the heart attack leads to cardiac arrest (the heart stops beating, and blood doesn’t circulate).Chew and swallow aspirin (unless you’re allergic), as aspirin helps protect against heart attack and eases pain and inflammation. It is not recommended that you take acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Taking aspirin can break up the blood clot causing the heart attack. Aspirin should not be taken in lieu of proper medical care.If you are having a heart attack, you will want a proper diagnosis and medical direction on how to take care of your heart going forward. What you think is a heart attack may also be a symptom of another ailment such as angina or anxiety. No matter what, get yourself checked out.How to Prevent a Heart AttackIn order to protect your heart, you need to lower your risk factors to help prevent a heart attack. Be heart-smart and alter your lifestyle.Commit to eating healthier, engaging in physical activity on a consistent basis, giving up vices such as smoking, getting your stress under control, and managing your weight. Be sure to treat related conditions such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease and peripheral artery disease.Your heart doesn’t operate by itself; it has a team of factors which add to its health or detriment.Here’s a little food for thought: Keep a list of your medications and allergies in your wallet – it is beneficial to medical personnel in the event of an emergency. You will also want to include your health care provider’s contact information as well as your emergency contact.Don’t underplay anything related to your heart. Eat well, get your cardiovascular system checked out, and be sure to stay active. Committing to keeping your heart happy will help you live a much healthier life.ResourcesNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (Heart Attack)American Heart Association (Atherosclerosis)The Heart and Stroke Foundation (Heart Attack)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsAll AgesWhy Exactly Do We Have Wisdom Teeth?All AgesThe Causes of Seizures and How to CopeAll Ages7 Common Symptoms of Flu You Should Know AboutAll AgesUnderstanding Your Body’s Ovulation CycleGolden YearsThe Five Most Common Health Concerns for SeniorsTwenty-SomethingUnderstanding the 5 Types of OCDyou may also likeEmpty NesterIs LASIK Eye Surgery Worth the Cost?Empty NesterFive Hair Loss Treatment Options Worth Looking IntoEmpty NesterHigh Cholesterol: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment and NutritionEmpty NesterSafety Concerns and Health Benefits of Online Prescriptionsconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsOur TeamContact UsHealthLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

As women, our bodies send different warning signals than men when there is an issue in our bodies, including when we have a heart attack. Since the warning signs of a heart attack in women are different compared to men, it is good to know what the symptoms are and how to catch them early.What Is a Heart Attack?All parts of your body need oxygen and the heart is no exception. Your heart is responsible for sending oxygenated blood throughout the body as well as to itself. If the blood flow delivering oxygen to the heart is met by a roadblock that does not allow enough oxygen through, it results in a heart attack. These blockages that cause heart attacks happen due to the slow accumulation of fat, cholesterol and plaque in the arteries.How Heart Attacks Are Different in Men and WomenIn the grand scheme of things, the body mechanics of men and women operate quite similarly, albeit with some differences here and there. Heart attacks are different in men and women for a variety of reasons.Subtle SymptomsWomen’s bodies may start to exhibit warning symptoms weeks or months ahead of the heart attack itself. With such a lag in time, it is easier shrug off symptoms rather than look into them further, especially if they mimic the symptoms of acid reflux, the flu, or normal aging. While men have more typical symptoms of central chest pain, women are more likely to experience shortness of breath, pressure in the lower chest, upper back pressure, fatigue, or light-headedness.Arm PainDuring a heart attack, men are more likely to feel pain in the left arm. In women, pain can be felt in either arm.AgeThe average age for a man to have his first heart attack is 65 years old. The first heart attack for women is around age 72. An explanation for this age gap is possibly due to estrogen’s effect on blood vessels.Medical Attention and TreatmentPossibly as a result of subtle symptoms, women generally do not reach out to a medical professional as quickly as men, and women are less often referred for appropriate treatment. Following a heart attack, women are less likely to engage in therapies, like blood pressure medication, which generally means their outcomes following a heart attack are worse than men.Location of Heart DiseaseAdding to the reasons why women’s symptoms may mask heart disease, women and men experience heart disease in different areas. Women’s heart disease is usually found in the smaller blood vessels of the heart (microvascular disease), while in men, heart disease is more likely in the major coronary arteries.Warning Signs of a Heart Attack in WomenThere is a window of time prior to a heart attack that women can recognize that they should check in on their health. If you experience these symptoms you will want to get a checkup:Chest discomfortShortness of breathCold sweatsNauseaLight-headednessFatigueIndigestionAnxietyDiscomfort in the shoulder area, headaches and vision problemsSymptoms of a Heart Attack for a WomanThe most common symptom of a heart attack is chest pain or discomfort, but actual heart attack symptoms may not be related to chest pain at all. Symptoms during a heart attack can be:Pain in the back, jaw, or neck. When there are heart issues, nerves in that area are triggered, but you may feel the pain elsewhere. Pay particular attention if the origin of the pain is hard to pinpoint (you are not feeling the pain in a specific muscle or joint).Intense fatigue. When simple activities make you excessively exhausted, you may be having heart distress.Breathing difficulties. Notice when you cannot catch your breath or breathing worsens when lying down and improves when you are propped up.Sweating. You start to sweat without reason, or you feel cold and clammy.Arm pain. Pain or discomfort may come from one or both arms.Related Search Topics What Is Liver CancerWeight Loss Diet PlanTreatment For HerpesLiver Cancer Facts You May Also LikeHow Online Health Care can Make Doctor Visits More EfficientEmpty NesterHow Online Health Care can Make Doctor Visits More Efficient4 years ago| by Katrina HodginsIn times of technology, online health care has become quite popular. Here is all you need to know about it, how it works and what it costs.Heart Attack Treatment OptionsThe earlier you treat your heart issues, the better chance you have to nip the problem in the bud before it becomes a heart attack. Effective heart attack treatment options are performed by medical professionals.MedicationsWith a heart attack, blood thinning medications or medications that dissolve or prevent blood clots are given by the doctor to help maintain blood flow through the affected artery. A doctor may use aspirin, thrombolytics, antiplatelet agents, or heparin.Other medicine that may be used is nitroglycerin, as it dilates blood vessels to improve blood flow and is also used to manage chest pain. Beta blockers take pressure off the heart by relaxing heart muscle, slowing the heartbeat and decreasing blood pressure. ACE inhibitors also lower blood pressure.Surgical and Other TreatmentsCoronary angioplasty and stenting are commonly used in a surgical procedure for heart attack patients. A catheter tube goes to the site of the artery blockage. There is a balloon on the catheter that inflates briefly to open the blocked coronary artery, where a mesh stent may be inserted. This stent keeps the artery open long term to restore blood flow to the heart.There’s also coronary artery bypass surgery. This is where the veins or arteries are sewn in place beyond the blocked coronary artery allowing a different route for blood to flow to the heart (and bypassing the blocked section).Also, cardiac rehabilitation is used. Following a heart attack and surgery, there are programs available that focus on heart medications, lifestyle changes, emotional issues and how to safely return to your normal activities.Heart Attack Prevention TipsThere are a few things you can do to keep your heart heathy and track your heart health:See your doctor for regular checkupsKnow your health numbers and risk factors like blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, hypertensionManage your stressMaintain a healthy lifestyle, including diet and exerciseQuit smokingIn ConclusionOver 25% of heart attacks in women go unrecognized.

They are medically referred to as osteophytes and are pointy bone growths that develop along the edges of bones. They usually form at the joints of the body, where the bones meet each other. Bone spurs commonly form on the joints in the lower back, neck, hip, shoulder, knee, fingers, foot, heel and big toe.Most are not easily noticed, as they often cause mild to no symptoms, allowing most people to function normally. Bone spurs may only be discovered incidentally by body scans, which may be used in order to check for other structural abnormalities, or as part of a routine medical checkup.What Is the Cause?The most common cause of bone spurs is damaged tissue, which is often a consequence of osteoarthritis - a medical condition that damages cartilage and leads to joint stiffness and pain, or tendinitis – a medical condition in which tendons that connect muscles to bones become inflamed.When tissue damage happens, the body tries to repair the loss by stimulating the cells that are responsible for bone formation to release and deposit bone along the affected area. This bone deposit results in the pointed swelling or bulge.Where Do Bone Spurs Form?They may occur in the spine as a result of a type of arthritis that affects the spine. This spinal arthritis is called ankylosing spondylitis and it results from the swelling of the ligament, a fibrous connective tissue that joins bone to bone, around the degenerating discs between the vertebrae.Also, they may occur in the heel, at the back of the calcaneus bone, as a consequence of inflammation of the Achilles tendon. Additionally, they may develop when the plantar fascia tissue, which is located under the heel bone, experiences inflammation. Other inflammatory arthritis conditions that can cause bone spurs in the heel include reactive arthritis and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH)/ Forestier’s disease.A few cases have been found to be congenital. A popular example of a congenital spur is osteochondroma.Other causes:DietGeneticsObesityInjuries/overuseSpinal conditions (i.e. spinal stenosis)Related Search Topics What Is Liver CancerArthritis Pain ReliefDiabetes Type 2 SymptomsShingles Symptoms You May Also LikeHow to Improve Your Health With Collagen SupplementsSandwich GenerationHow to Improve Your Health With Collagen Supplements4 years ago| by Katrina HodginsThe benefits of collagen supplements are endless and they come in different forms. Find out about them here and all the great things they do for your body.Symptoms of Bone SpursThe symptoms largely vary depending on the location of the spur. They can cause symptoms if they irritate tissues including nerves, skin, fat and/or tendons.SpineIn the spine they can cause irritation of the spinal cord and/or nerve roots. This is because the spinal canal, which houses the spinal cord, may become narrowed by the bone spur, leading to numbness, stiffness, pain, tingling and/or weakness in the area that the affected nerve supplies.KneeIn the knee they can often lead to pain when extending and flexing the knee.FingersIn the fingers they often cause lumps and swelling in the lower finger joints.HipsBone spurs in the hip often limit movement in and around the hip joint, resulting in hip pain, and in some cases, knee pain.ShoulderBone spurs in the shoulder cause swelling, limiting the space needed for the ligaments and tendons to function optimally, resulting in decreased range of motion, and may also lead to tearing of the rotator cuff muscles.NeckIn the neck they can irritate nearby nerves and lead to pain, weakness and numbness.HeelIn the heel they can cause pain, tenderness and swelling, and may lead to issues with walking.What Are the Treatment Options?Treatment is only necessary when they are symptomatic. Initially, treatment is focused on relieving pain and inflammation. It’s recommended that patients first try conservative treatment options before undergoing more radical treatment techniques.Resting the area and applying ice for 10 to 15 minutes at a time can help to decrease local inflammation and pain. For pain relief, over-the-counter pain medications, including acetaminophen, are recommended. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen or naproxen sodium, are often used too. Many health professionals advocate corticosteroid injection into the joint to ease pain and reduce swelling; however, it is important to note that this is a temporary solution and the injection may have to be repeated.There are also mechanical techniques for the treatment. The use of local bone spur pads and shoe inserts (orthotics) often provide relief. Overweight sufferers of bone spurs may be advised to shed some weight and rest the affected areas in order to reduce the strain on the joints. Physical therapy, including stretching and strengthening exercises of the affected area, may also be recommended. If the above conservative treatment options fail, surgery may be warranted. Currently there is no way to prevent bone spurs from developing.In ConclusionBone spurs often do not cause symptoms, but when they do they can range from mild discomfort to debilitating pain. Often symptoms can be relieved with rest, ice, over-the-counter pain medications and NSAIDs, mechanical devices, and/or physical therapy. However, some cases do require surgery.ResourcesMayo Clinic (Bone spurs)MedicineNet (Bone Spurs)NHS (Osteophyte (bone spur))Harvard Health Publishing (Bone spurs)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsAll Ages8 Reasons Why Breakfast Really Is the Most Important Meal of the DayAll AgesThe 8 Most Common Allergies to Be Aware OfAll Ages14 Common Medicinal Herbs and Their UsesAll AgesDo Weight Loss Injections Work?All AgesSix Symptoms of Measles to Watch out ForAll AgesDo Our Eyebrows Actually Have a Purpose?you may also likeSandwich Generation7 Causes of Insomnia During PregnancySandwich GenerationWhat to Consider Before Becoming a VegetarianSandwich GenerationThe 8 Most Common Food Allergies in ChildrenSandwich Generation8 Signs and Symptoms of Pancreatitisconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsOur TeamContact UsHealthLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Understanding the Causes of AmenorrheaFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail3 years ago| by Miles Martin What Is Amenorrhea?What is amenorrhea? It is the medical term for when a woman does not menstruate (get her period), regardless of the cause. It is not usually a deadly condition and it affects about 1% of American women.Because it is a physiological state rather than a disease caused by a specific pathogen, there can be several possible causes, which may have different treatment options. This article will walk you through the causes, symptoms and treatment options, as well as tips on how to prevent this condition when possible.Causes of AmenorrheaThere are two categories; primary is when a young woman experiences delays in getting her first period and secondary occurs in adult women when menstruation stops. The most common cause of primary is a family history of it.There are several different causes of secondary amenorrhea and some of them are just natural functions of the body, while others are unnatural.Natural CausesPregnancyWomen do not get their period during pregnancy and a late period is often an early indicator of pregnancy. Amenorrhea also lasts for about six to eight weeks after giving birth in women who do not breastfeed.BreastfeedingIn women who do breastfeed, amenorrhea may continue for the duration of the breastfeeding period, or they may get their period again while still breastfeeding. It can vary from woman to woman.MenopauseWomen who have completed menopause experience permanent amenorrhea as part of a natural life cycle.Unnatural CausesContraceptivesBirth control pills and other forms of contraception may stop periods in certain women. In fact, one motivation for taking birth control for some women is shorter, lighter periods that occur less frequently.Other MedicationsAntipsychotics, cancer chemotherapy, antidepressants, blood pressure medication and allergy medicines are all drugs that may cause women to stop having their period.Lifestyle FactorsLow body weight, excessive exercise and stress may all be contributing factors for lack of a period. This is why women with eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia often experience amenorrhea.Hormonal ImbalanceMenstruation is regulated by hormones, so hormonal imbalances can throw this cycle out of whack. Some of the illnesses that can cause these imbalances include polycystic ovary syndrome, thyroid malfunction, a pituitary tumor, or premature menopause.Structural DefectsSometimes the issue is purely physical. Women with advanced uterine scarring may experience this health condition and congenital issues with the reproductive organs may cause a woman never to get her period.What Are the Symptoms?It is very easy to spot, since the primary symptom is not getting a period, which will be easily noticed by most women. Additional symptoms of amenorrhea vary based on the cause, but can include:HeadachesVision changesNauseaFacial hairChanges in breast sizeMilky discharge from the breastsTreatment OptionsWhen it is caused by pregnancy, breastfeeding, or menopause, it cannot be treated and is part of the normal, healthy lifecycle of a woman. In some other cases, it will not be desirable to treat. For example, a young woman on birth control who does not get her period may be perfectly happy that way. However, amenorrhea caused by an underlying health condition should be treated.In young women experiencing the primary type, the best treatment is often to watch and wait, since periods may start naturally on their own. In young women experiencing this as a result of an anatomical issue, surgery may help, but this is not a guarantee.Related Search Topics What Is Kidney CancerSymptoms of Ovarian CancerArthritis Pain ReliefShingles Symptoms You May Also LikeUnderstanding the Treatment Options for Cystic FibrosisAll AgesUnderstanding the Treatment Options for Cystic Fibrosis5 years ago| by Sheree McDonaldThere are many cystic fibrosis treatment options that are currently available. Be sure to consult with your doctor and find the right fit for your needs.Secondary Amenorrhea Treatment OptionsFor secondary types, the treatments largely depend on the underlying cause that is determined by your doctor.Adjusting Lifestyle FactorsIf amenorrhea is caused by either excessive weight loss or exercise, changing exercise plan or diet may help periods return to normal. Receiving treatment for mental health in the form of counseling or medications may help if amenorrhea is thought to be caused by stress.MedicationsIf amenorrhea is caused by a thyroid issue, hormonal imbalance, or other disease, a doctor can prescribe an appropriate treatment that may also handle the amenorrhea.Adjusting Birth ControlIf amenorrhea is caused by birth control, then changing the type of birth control or stopping birth control entirely may cure the amenorrhea. However, this may not always be necessary if a woman is otherwise healthy.Prevention MethodsNatural amenorrhea is unpreventable, since it is considered normal and healthy. Not all unnatural causes of amenorrhea are easily predicted and prevented, like amenorrhea caused by a thyroid problem, hormonal imbalance, or physical problem.Amenorrhea caused by lifestyle factors may be preventable by maintaining a healthy weight, moderating exercise and reducing stress. Amenorrhea caused by birth control is easily preventable by not taking the birth control or sticking to forms of birth control that do not interfere with the body, like condoms.Talk to Your DoctorAmenorrhea can be frightening if you are not expecting it, but it is not generally considered a deadly condition and, depending on the cause, it may even be normal and healthy. But you should always discuss new symptoms with your doctor, since they know your medical history and can help you determine if your amenorrhea needs to be treated.ResourcesMedicalNewsToday (What is amenorrhea?)Mayo Clinic (Amenorrhea)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsGolden YearsUnderstanding the Different Types of Atrial FibrillationGolden Years5 Reasons an Engraved Medical ID Beats a CellphoneEmpty Nester5 Types of Insoles to Get You Back on Your FeetTwenty-Something9 DIY Acne Remedies to AvoidSandwich GenerationUnderstanding Eczema in Children and How to Treat ItSandwich GenerationNatural Remedies to Stop Sweatingyou may also likeAll Ages8 Reasons Why Your Breath May Smell BadAll AgesAcupressure vs. Acupuncture: What You Need to KnowAll AgesWhat Is ALS: Understanding This Debilitating DiseaseAll AgesWhat Happens When You Deprive Yourself of Sleep?connect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsOur TeamContact UsHealthLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Understanding the Cause of Unpredictable EmotionsFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail7 years ago| by Eric Patterson Why Am I So Emotional?It’s not that you’re sad all the time. It’s not that you’re angry all the time or even annoyed all the time. Instead, your moods change wildly from hour to hour and day to day.Sometimes, it is easy to understand your shifting feelings. When someone makes a thoughtless comment, you get annoyed. When an important event doesn’t go your way, you get angry.Other times are not so clear, though. You notice you are getting sad or anxious for no reason, and the intensity of your response always seems disproportionate to the trigger because tiny problems produce huge results.You are emotional. The problem is obvious, but now, you are interested in understanding where this unpredictability stems from.When you know the source of your symptoms, you can combat them and find a solution. The cause is not always clear since a combination of physical health, mental health, and stress management issues can all contribute.Possible factors leading towards your unsteady emotions include the following.Physical Health ProblemsThough looking directly at your mental health may seem obvious, taking that step might be premature because there is a range of physical health problems that can result in feeling moody or overly emotional.People who struggle with changing blood sugar frequently feel anxious when levels are low. Thyroid issues are strongly associated with mood changes and irritability. Problems with moodiness are related to cardiovascular issues. If you are a woman in her mid or late 40s, menopause might be to blame for your problems.These physical ailments, which are only a small sampling of possible complications, can be identified through a number measures and diagnostic procedures. By treating the primary physical health condition, the mental health effects of being emotion will recuperate.During your treatment, focus on improving your diet, activity levels, and sleep to further boost your physical state.Mental Health ProblemsIf your visits to the physician’s office did not prove successful, it might be time to consider a mental health source of your emotional changes.There is a range of mental health problems that are related to being moody or overly emotional. There is also a huge amount of misinformation that surrounds mental health, so be sure to avoid self-diagnosis.Related Search Topics Liver Spot TreatmentWhat Is Liver CancerDiabetes Type 2 SymptomsTreatments for Depression You May Also LikeFour Common Health Myths, Busted!All AgesFour Common Health Myths, Busted!8 years ago| by Pat BratianuMany health myths have survived for a long time because they contain more than a grain of truth. Other beliefs are just flat out wrong.When people think about changing moods and being emotional, they often think of bipolar disorder. If I am happy one minute and sad the next, I must be bipolar, right? No.Moodiness can be a sign of bipolar disorder, but many more a needed for a diagnosis. Bipolar is marked by having periods of depression with symptoms presenting more often than not for at least two weeks and periods of mania or hypomania lasting for at least four days.People who are described as “emotional” do not meet the criteria for bipolar disorder.To be certain of your mental health, seek out an evaluation from a mental health specialist. Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other mental health conditions are linked to changing moods, but the risk of these disorders remains low relative to other explanations.A mental health expert can ask questions to assess your presenting problems and the history of your symptoms to formulate a complete diagnosis appropriate for you.Poor Stress ManagementThe third contributor to being overly emotional is probably the simplest and most common: poor stress management.Everyone has an ever-changing level of stress that is equal to their stresses minus their coping skills. Even when stress is high, effective coping skills can counteract the results of many stressors. The problems come when coping skills are too few or ineffective.Think about your daily stress. By the time you wake up, you might be at a 50 out of 100. A series of stressors occur during your day causing your number to increase, and without stress management skills, your number will stay high.Anytime you approach 100, you have an emotional response in the form of an unwanted behavior, negative thought, or problematic feeling, which reduces your stress number only slightly.Being late to work sparks feelings of frustration. Getting yelled at by your boss causes you to speak more pessimistically. Spilling your afternoon coffee on your pants triggers your decision to storm out of your office crying.During this day, your emotions were strong and frequently changing. Your level of stress peaked near 100 each time and stayed close to the top making it more likely for even minor stressors to elicit an emotional reaction.Managing StressPeople who seem calm and collected probably don’t have fewer stressors; they probably have better coping skills to manage their stress. Do you want to finally put stress in its place? Here’s how:Acknowledge your levels. People with high levels of stress usually try hard not to think about their stress, but this is a mistake. To improve your stress, you must study it. What makes it better? What makes it worse? Think of your stress level like a thermometer; it is not just high or low — there are many degrees in between.Dismiss the contributors. Thinking about your stress may lead you to notice that certain people or things regularly spark your stress. Seek to improve these issues whenever possible. If nothing can be done, avoidance may be your only option.Find the positives. Exercise, spend time with friends, watch your favorite movie, listen to a meaningful song, take a long bath, or yell into a pillow. Your mission is to experiment with coping skills that work for you.Use prevention more than damage control. Some people only use coping skills as damage control after the stress has happened. These are helpful, but often too little too late. Instead of waiting to use coping skills when stress is high, perform them early and often to keep stress low.Why are you so emotional? It can be really hard to tell, so take practical steps to assess your physical and mental well-being.With a clean bill of health, you can focus on the problem of stress management. Find your contributors, avoid the ones you can, and then explore preventive coping skills to reduce your stress to reduce your emotionality and moodiness. You might be a few steps away from the stability you seek.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsEmpty Nester6 Erectile Dysfunction Treatment Options to ConsiderGolden YearsHow to Decide When Your Loved One with Alzheimer’s Needs Additional CareSandwich GenerationVarious Ways to Help Soothe Your Baby’s EczemaEmpty NesterIs LASIK Eye Surgery Worth the Cost?Twenty-SomethingIs an IUD the Right Birth Control for You?Golden YearsThe Five Most Common Health Concerns for Seniorsyou may also likeAll AgesWhat You Need to Know About Hepatitis CAll AgesWhy Do Styes Suddenly Appear and How Do You Treat Them?All AgesWhat Is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome?All AgesTreating Ulcerative Colitis: Understanding Your Optionsconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsOur TeamContact UsHealthLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

How to store cefalexin Important information about all medicines About cefalexinType of medicineA cephalosporin antibioticUsed forTreatment (and sometimes prevention) of infectionAlso calledCephalexin (in US); KeflexÂ®Available asCapsules, tablets, and oral liquid medicineCefalexin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which means that it is active against a wide variety of germs (bacteria). It is used to treat bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections, skin infections, chest and throat infections, ear infections and dental infections. It is suitable for adults and children and can be taken during pregnancy. Some people who are allergic to penicillin antibiotics may not be able to take cefalexin, so make sure your doctor knows if you have ever had an allergic reaction to any other antibiotic.Cefalexin treats an infection by killing the bacteria that are causing it.Before taking cefalexinSome medicines are not suitable for people with certain conditions, and sometimes a medicine may only be used if extra care is taken. For these reasons, before you (or your child, if appropriate) start taking cefalexin it is important that your doctor knows:If you have ever had an allergic reaction to a medicine. It is particularly important that you tell your doctor if you have had a bad reaction to a penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotic.If you have any problems with the way your kidneys work.If you are pregnant, trying for a baby or breastfeeding. Although cefalexin is not known to be harmful to babies, it is still important that you tell your doctor if you are expecting or breastfeeding a baby.If you are taking or using any other medicines. This includes any medicines you are taking which are available to buy without a prescription, as well as herbal and complementary medicines.How to take cefalexinBefore you start taking cefalexin, read the manufacturer's printed information leaflet from inside the pack. It will give you more information about the antibiotic and will provide you with a full list of side-effects which you could experience from taking it.As a guide, it is usual to take 2-4 doses of cefalexin daily to treat an infection. Your doctor will tell you what dose is right for you (or your child) and the directions for taking it will be printed on the label of the pack to remind you about what the doctor said to you. If you have been given cefalexin liquid medicine to give to your child, please read the directions carefully to make sure that you give the correct amount. Your doctor will tell you how long your course of treatment will last - this is commonly about 5-7 days, although it could be for longer or shorter periods of time than this. It is important that you take cefalexin exactly as your doctor tells you to.If you have been prescribed cefalexin to prevent a urinary tract infection from recurring, you are likely to be asked to take just one dose a day. Please take it in the evening. A course of treatment such as this can last for some time.Cefalexin can be taken either before or after food, although it may start to work a little sooner if it is taken before food.Space the doses evenly throughout the day. Keep taking this medicine until the course is finished unless you are told to stop. It is important to take the full course (even if you feel your infection has cleared up) in order to prevent the infection from coming back.If you forget to take a dose, take one as soon as you remember. Try to take the correct number of doses each day but do not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose.Getting the most from your treatmentIf you are having an operation or any other medical treatment, tell the person carrying out the treatment that you are taking an antibiotic. This is because cefalexin can interfere with the results of some medical tests.Some people develop redness and itching in the mouth or vagina (thrush) after taking a course of antibiotics. If after taking cefalexin you think you could have thrush, please speak with your doctor or pharmacist for advice.If you are taking the contraceptive 'pill' at the same time as an antibiotic, the effectiveness of the 'pill' can be reduced if you have a bout of being sick (vomiting) or diarrhoea which lasts for more than 24 hours. If this should happen, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice about what additional contraceptive precautions to use. There is no need to use additional precautions for any bouts of sickness or diarrhoea which last for less than 24 hours.Antibiotics like cefalexin can stop the oral typhoid vaccine from working properly. If you are due to have any vaccinations, please make sure the person treating you knows that you are taking this antibiotic.Can cefalexin cause problems?Along with their useful effects, most medicines can cause unwanted side-effects although not everyone experiences them.

You are just a week away from full term.How Big Is Your Baby At 36 Weeks?This week, babies are usually about the size of a large cabbage (1). An average baby measures 19.13in (48.6cm) in length and weighs about 6.30lb (2.859kg) (2).Baby Development In The 36th weekBody PartsDevelopment stageHeadThe size of the head is in proportion to the size of the body (3).SkinThe protective coating on the skin, called vernix, gets thicker. Thereâs an increase in body fat (4).LungsWill develop faster this week on (5).LanugoRemains on the head but disappears from the face (6).LimbsFully formed with fingernails and toenails.EarsEarlobes that are soft, with little cartilage, are formed.MusclesAre fully toned, and the baby can turn and lift the head.BonesAll the bones in the body, except the skull bones, continue to harden at this time. The skull bones stay separated and soft until after the birth, to make the babyâs descent through the cervix smoother (7).Digestive systemIs fully developed and ready to deal with breast milk.Fetal position and movements: By the 36th week, the baby attains a head-down position deep into your pelvis. The movements will be lesser compared to the previous months, due to the insufficient space inside the uterus. There will be more leg and arm movements and fewer squirming movements. Since the baby is head-down, you will feel the kicks mostly under your ribs.What symptoms of pregnancy do you experience in the 36th week?The symptoms in the 36th week are more or less similar to those you have been experiencing in the last couple of months. They include: Weight gain: An average weight gain of one to two pounds per week during the third trimester of pregnancy is considered safe, as recommended by the American Pregnancy Association (APA) (8). However, in case of women who have BMI less than 18.5 and greater than 24.9, the recommended weight gain rates usually range in between 0.5 to one pound. As the baby moves down into the pelvis, the pressure from the diaphragm is released, making it easier to breathe (9). You could feel nauseated, due to some bodily changes in the last few months. Slowed digestion, combined with the uterusâ pressure on the stomach, can push the food upwards into the esophagus, resulting in nausea and vomiting. Image: Shutterstock Body aches, frequent urge to urinate and anxiety about the delivery can cause trouble sleeping. You may experience pressure and discomfort in the pelvic area when the baby engages the head deep into the pelvis. The growing uterusâ pressure on the rectal veins causes the blood vessels to swell up in that area, resulting in hemorrhoids. The growing uterus also pushes the stomach acids into the esophagus, causing heartburn.Related: Heartburn During Pregnancy: Causes, Symptoms And Treatment As the digestion process slows down, the food remains in the digestive tract for a long time, making you feel bloated and gassy and can cause constipation. The excess water retention in the body causes swelling of feet and ankles. Image: Shutterstock Braxton Hicks contractions are irregular and painless contractions that help prepare your body for labor. Fatigue is quite common towards the end of pregnancy. The pressure exerted by the enlarged uterus increases the frequency of urination. The pregnancy hormones relax the joints, which can lead to hip pain. As there is a shift in the center of gravity of the body, you may feel clumsy. With just four weeks to go, you start experiencing bodily changes that indicate your baby is on track. Point to considerAt 36 weeks of pregnancy, you may also experience symptoms such as a heightened sense of smell, a milky-white vaginal discharge, and light spotting (1).Changes In The Body In The 36th WeekYour body is likely to undergo some of these physical and emotional changes during pregnancy.

Image: ShutterStockStomach flu during pregnancy, or viral gastroenteritis, is an infection by a virus that causes acute inflammation in the intestinal lining. Pregnant women are more prone to dealing with stomach flu and its complications because of their weakened immune systems (1).In most cases, this infection is self-limiting and does not harm the baby. Many home remedies may also help you deal with the issue. However, you should seek medical advice if you notice worrying symptoms such as high fever, fatigue, or diarrhea.Read this post to learn about the causes of stomach flu during pregnancy, its symptoms, treatment, and prevention.In This ArticleCauses Of Stomach Flu During PregnancyStomach Flu or Morning Sickness?Symptoms Of A Stomach FluHow To Deal With Stomach Bug During Pregnancy?Water Vs. Electrolyte Replacement Drinks: Which One Is Better?When Should You Call The Doctor?Can You Take Medication?How To Prevent Stomach Flu While You Are Pregnant?Can Stomach Infections Hurt Your Baby?Frequently Asked QuestionsInfographic: How To Deal With Stomach Bug During Pregnancy?Key PointersCauses Of Stomach Flu During PregnancyStomach flu or viral gastroenteritis can be caused by viruses such as norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, sapovirus, and astrovirus. Among these, noroviruses, also known as stomach bugs, cause approximately 50% of foodborne viral infection outbreaks worldwide (2). The illness is contracted from contaminated water or food that is made under unhygienic conditions or not cooked properly.You may also get viruses through direct contact with infected people or if you keep unwashed hands in your mouth after touching contaminated surfaces (2) (3).Note: Acute gastroenteritis can also be caused by bacteria like salmonella, listeria, shigella, and campylobacter jejuni (2). Though the symptoms are somewhat similar to stomach flu, it may require treatment with medication such as antibiotics. Stomach flu is not the flu, which is a respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus (3).Related: Norovirus Infections And Pregnancy - Everything You Should Be Aware Of Did you know?Norovirus outbreaks have been found to occur mostly from November to April. However, it may occur at any time (20).Stomach Flu or Morning Sickness?Stomach flu can be harder to identify during the early stages of pregnancy when most women suffer from morning sickness. However, if vomiting and nausea are accompanied by a lack of appetite, cramps, fever, or diarrhea, you may be suffering from stomach flu. Moreover, stomach flu will last only for a few days, while morning sickness remains until the second trimester (4).Symptoms Of A Stomach Flu Image: ShutterstockIn order to make sure that it is not morning sickness but stomach flu, you should look for a few more signs that show up in the first two days.The Possible Symptoms To Watch For Include (5): Severe diarrhea or loose, watery stools Abdominal pain and cramps Sudden low-grade fever Muscle aches Chills Fatigue Headache DehydrationThese symptoms may seem mild initially, but if they do not subside even after two days, you should check with a healthcare provider. It helps to treat the condition effectively. Dehydration can be very serious during pregnancy, whether caused by morning sickness or infection. No matter the cause, itâs important to see a doctor if your symptoms are severe.Related: Common Body Aches During Pregnancy And Tips To Deal With ThemHow To Deal With Stomach Bug During Pregnancy?If you are just beginning to feel the early symptoms, you can help yourself with a little care and effort. Here are some ways you can take care of yourself at home:1. Drink enough fluidsFluids are very important when you are suffering from stomach flu. Your body loses fluids through sweating, vomiting, and diarrhea. You are at risk of dehydration, especially if you are suffering from frequent urination or passing dark-colored urine. The lack of fluids may cause a reduction in the volume of blood, which may then compromise oxygen and nutrition supply to the growing fetus (6).Symptoms like constant thirst, dry mouth and skin, dark-colored urine, urine inconsistency, lack of urine, fatigue, or dizziness indicate dehydration (7).What to drink:Drink plenty of water, clear broth, warm water with lemon (relieves gas), decaffeinated tea or diluted juice (white grape juice is easy on tummy). Grape water, vegetable broth, soups, ginger ale, curd, yogurt, skimmed milk , and coconut water are good options. You can also prefer popsicles or ice chips if you cannot sip through liquids.You can add a dash of ginger to your juices or snacks, as it may help in combating infection. It also decreases nausea. After talking to your doctor, you can also drink over the counter oral rehydration solutions, such as Pedialyte, DripDrop, etc., to cope with fluid and electrolyte loss (6) (8).What not to drink: Caffeinated drinks such as strong black tea, coffee, and chocolate should be avoided. Stay away from alcohol as it is a diuretic and can aggravate your stomach flu. Stay away from outside food and junk food. You should also avoid undiluted fruit juices and sugary drinks that may increase diarrhea (6) (9). Drinks and food that contain a lot of fat should also be avoided since they increase diarrhea.Related: Caffeine (Coffee) During Pregnancy: Is It Safe?2. RestSickness and diarrhea due to stomach flu can make you feel tired and weak as your body fights against infection and also works to nurture your baby. Therefore, it is very important to get as much rest as possible. Rest until you feel you have recovered completely (10).3. Eat proper foodAs the symptoms of stomach flu begin to clear, you can gradually introduce bland and semi-solid foods. They are easier to digest. Solid foods are difficult for you to digest. Do not force yourself to eat more, as it can cause nausea.The BRAT diet (6): It is the best diet option to ease the stomach issue. It consists of bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast, which contain a considerable amount of carbohydrates. They provide energy and replenish your body with the nutrients lost through diarrhea and vomiting.Bananas: Ripe ones support digestion and replace the lost potassium.Rice: White rice is easy to digest and gives energy. Do not take brown rice as it contains high fiber, which could be hard on the stomach.Applesauce: Offers an energy boost through carbs and sugars present in it. It also contains pectin, which eases diarrhea.Toast: White bread is a good option and easy to digest. Whole wheat bread contains excess fiber, which is again not good for the digestive system.Boiled salty potatoes are also recommended during diarrhea, since it is aÂ good source of carbohydrates and the salt is good to replace the lost electrolytes.What not to eat (9): Dairy, fibrous, spicy, or fatty foods should be avoided.Dairy: Everyone may not have a problem with milk or dairy products, but they are not easily digestible.Fiber: Too much fiber can cause flatulence, bloating, loose stools, and diarrhea.Fatty foods: Do not include oily foods. Also, cut down spicy curries, chili sauces, and tomato containing dishes. Point to considerThe BRAT diet is low in nutrients compared to a healthy diet and you should be able to move to a regular diet within a day or two (21).Related: What To Eat & Avoid After A Miscarriage?4. GingerGinger is a natural digestion aid and an effective remedy for nausea (11). It may help relieve the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. You can take ginger chews available at health food stores or prefer homemade ginger tea. Here is how you can make brewed ginger tea:You will need: Freshly grated ginger â 1 1/2 teaspoon Boiling water â 1 1/2 cupHow to make: Take a cup and put the grated ginger. Now fill it with one-and-a-half cups of boiling water. Let it remain for about ten minutes and then strain it.If it tastes strong, you can add more boiling water to dilute the tea. Do not add any sweetener or sugar.5. MintAccording to The Oxford Book of Health Foods, written by J.G Vaughn, a professor of food sciences at Londonâs Kingâs College, and Dr. P.A. Judd, Principal Lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire, peppermint could also help combat an upset stomach, and it may ease symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. You can prepare peppermint tea the same way as ginger tea. You can also add lemon juice to add more flavor.6. ProbioticsConsuming probiotics may help in the management of acute gastroenteritis. You may continue to take them during the illness and also for at least two weeks later (12).7. Electrolyte drinksIdeally, your body system maintains a balance and contains ionic solutions known as electrolytes. They regulate the functioning of your body, nerves, and muscles. When you are suffering from stomach flu, you lose many of these ionic solutions through diarrhea and vomiting.To regain energy, stamina, and strength, you should replenish your body with the lost electrolytes. You can drink diluted, non-sugary natural fruit juices to prevent dehydration. You can drink diluted, non-sugary fruit juices to prevent dehydration.

Other symptoms that may occur include pain in your jaw muscles when you chew which eases when you rest the jaw muscles, and visual loss.See a doctor immediately if you suspect that you have temporal arteritis. People with temporal arteritis need urgent treatment with steroids. Treatment aims to prevent serious complications such as severe sight impairment which can occur soon after the disease starts.In this article What is temporal arteritis?

Temporal arteritis symptoms What are the possible complications of temporal arteritis? Do I need any tests for temporal arteritis? Temporal arteritis treatment Some other points about steroid tablets What is temporal arteritis?Temporal arteritis, also known as giant cell arteritis (GCA), is a condition which causes inflammation on the inside of some blood vessels (arteries). It is called 'giant cell' because abnormal large cells develop in the wall of the inflamed arteries. The arteries commonly affected are those around the head and neck area. One of the arteries that is commonly affected is the temporal artery. (You have a temporal artery on each side of the head. They are under the skin to the sides of the forehead - the temple area.) Therefore, the condition is sometimes called temporal arteritis. Several arteries may be affected at the same time.GCA is uncommon and mainly affects people over the age of 60 years. It rarely affects people aged under 50 years. Women are more commonly affected than men. The cause is not known.Temporal arteritis symptomsSymptoms of temporal arteritis can vary, and may depend on which blood vessel/s (artery or arteries) are mainly affected.Headache is the common symptom. It occurs in about two thirds of people with giant cell arteritis (GCA). This typically develops suddenly over a day or so but it sometimes develops gradually over several days or weeks. The headache can be one-sided, or on both sides. Typically, it is mainly towards the front and sides of the head.Tenderness of the scalp over the temporal arteries is common. You may be able to feel one or both of the inflamed temporal arteries under the skin, or see them in a mirror.Other symptoms may occur if the arteries going to these parts of the body are inflamed, become narrowed and reduce the blood supply to these areas. These include:Pain in the jaw muscles (jaw claudication) while eating or talking. This occurs in nearly half of affected people. The pain eases when you rest the jaw muscles.Visual disturbances: permanent partial or complete loss of vision in one or both eyes occurs in up to 1 in 5 affected people and is often an early symptom. People who are affected typically report a feeling of a shade covering one eye, which can progress to total loss of vision. The eye is not painful. If untreated, the second eye is likely to become affected within 1-2 weeks, although it can be affected within 24 hours. Urgent treatment is therefore essential. A temporary loss of vision in one eye or double vision (diplopia) may occur as a 'warning' symptom before any permanent visual loss.Some general symptoms also commonly occur. These include tiredness, depression, night sweats, fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. These may develop gradually and may be present for weeks or even months before a specific symptom such as headache or visual loss develops.Polymyalgia rheumatica - is often also presentUp to half of people with temporal arteritis develop a related condition called polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). If this develops it often occurs at the same time but may occur before or after the development of temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis). The typical symptoms of PMR are pain, tenderness and stiffness of muscles around the shoulders and upper arms, and sometimes around the hips and neck. PMR is due to inflammation in the affected muscles, but the cause is unknown. The treatment is similar for both conditions. Treatment for PMR is usually very effective. See the separate leaflet called Polymyalgia Rheumatica for more details.What are the possible complications of temporal arteritis?Note: complications are much less likely to occur if treatment is started soon after symptoms begin.Possible complications include the following:Total loss of vision in one or both eyesIf an affected blood vessel (artery) becomes very swollen (inflamed), the blood supply going down that artery can become blocked. The most common arteries this affects are the small arteries going to the eye. If one of these arteries becomes blocked it can cause permanent, serious visual problems, even total loss of vision, in the affected eye. Total or partial loss of vision may occur in up to 1 in 5 people with untreated giant cell arteritis (GCA). Once vision is lost, there is little chance of recovery of vision, even with treatment. Therefore, treatment is aimed at preventing visual loss or, if visual loss has occurred in one eye, to prevent loss in the other eye. However, even with treatment, visual loss occurs in up to 1 in 20 cases.Problems related to other arteries being affectedOther serious complications sometimes develop if the inflammation occurs in other arteries. For example, serious complications can include a heart attack, an aortic aneurysm, a stroke, damage to nerves, or deafness (caused by a blocked artery in the brain).Do I need any tests for temporal arteritis?A blood test can detect if there is inflammation in your body. This is the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test or the C-reactive protein (CRP) test. If the blood test shows a high level of inflammation and you have the typical symptoms then temporal arteritis is likely. However, the blood test is not specific for GCA (it can also be high in other inflammatory disorders). Also, some people with GCA have a normal blood test.To confirm the diagnosis a doctor may take a small part of the temporal artery (a biopsy) to look at under a microscope. If you have GCA a doctor can see the inflammation and abnormal giant cells in the sample of the blood vessel (artery) wall.Temporal arteritis treatmentIf temporal arteritis is suspected, treatment is usually started straightaway - even before a sample taken (a biopsy) can confirm the diagnosis. The main aim is to reduce the risk of possible complications. The second aim is to relieve the headache and any other symptoms.Steroid tabletsA steroid medicine such as prednisolone is the usual main treatment. Steroids work by reducing inflammation. After starting treatment, symptoms usually ease within a few days.A high dose of steroid is started at first, usually about 60 mg per day. This is then reduced gradually to a lower 'maintenance' dose. It may take several months to reduce the dose gradually. The maintenance dose needed to keep symptoms away and prevent complications varies from person to person. Usually it is around 10 mg per day.In some people the condition goes away after 2-3 years, allowing the steroid treatment to be gradually withdrawn. This should always be done under supervision of a doctor. However, many people need treatment for several years, sometimes for life.If taking steroids causes too many or severe side-effects then other medications, such as methotrexate or tocilizumab, may be used instead.A medicine to prevent 'thinning of the bones' (osteoporosis)This may be advised - see below for the reasons.Some other points about steroid tabletsDo not stop taking steroid tablets suddenly. It probably does no harm if you forget to take the odd tablet. However, once your body is used to steroids, if you stop the tablets suddenly you may develop serious withdrawal effects within a few days.Do not take anti-inflammatory painkillers whilst you take steroids, unless advised by a doctor. The two together increase your risk of developing a stomach ulcer.Most people who take regular steroids carry a steroid card. This gives details of your dose, condition, etc, in case of emergencies.If you are ill with other conditions, or have surgery, the dose of steroid may need to be increased for a short time. This is because you need more steroid during physical stress.Side-effectsThe risk of developing side-effects from steroids is increased with higher doses. This is why the dose used is the lowest that keeps symptoms away. Possible side-effects from steroids include the following:'Thinning of the bones' (osteoporosis) - but you can take a medicine to help protect against this if you are at increased risk. For example, if you are aged 65 years or older, or have a history of fractures, you should take a medicine to help protect against osteoporosis. Your doctor will advise. If you are aged less than 65 years and do not have a history of fractures you may be offered a special scan which measures bone density (a DXA scan). If your bone density is below a certain level you may be offered a medicine to protect against osteoporosis. See the separate leaflet called Preventing Steroid-induced Osteoporosis for more information.Increased chance of infections - in particular, a severe form of chickenpox and measles. Note: most people have had chickenpox and are immune to it. Also, most people have either had measles or have been immunised against it and are immune. But, if you have not had chickenpox or measles (or immunisation for measles), keep away from people with measles, chickenpox, or shingles (which is caused by the same virus as chickenpox). Tell a doctor if you come into contact with anyone with these conditions if you are unsure about your medical past history.Weight gain.Increase in blood pressure. Have your blood pressure checked regularly. It can be treated if it becomes high.High blood sugar which may mean extra treatment if you have diabetes. Steroids may occasionally cause diabetes to develop. If you take long-term steroids, your doctor may arrange a yearly blood sugar test to check for diabetes - in particular, if you have a family history of diabetes.Skin problems such as poor healing after injuries, thinning skin and easy bruising. Stretchmarks sometimes develop.Muscle weakness.Mood and behavioural changes. Some people actually feel better in themselves when they take steroids. However, steroids may aggravate depression and other mental health problems and may occasionally cause mental health problems. If this side-effect occurs it tends to happen within a few weeks of starting treatment and is more likely with higher doses. Some people become confused and irritable. They may even develop delusions and suicidal thoughts. These mental health effects can also occur when steroid treatment is being withdrawn. Seek medical advice if worrying mood or behavioural changes occur.An increased risk of developing cataracts.An increased risk of duodenal ulcers and stomach ulcers. Tell your doctor if you develop indigestion or stomach (abdominal) pains.Although the above points have to be mentioned, do not be put off about steroids. The relief of symptoms and the prevention of serious complications usually outweigh the risk of side-effects from the doses of steroids used for temporal arteritis.Previous article Vitreous Haemorrhage Next article Charles Bonnet Syndrome Are you protected against flu?See if you are eligible for a free NHS flu jab today.Check nowJoin our weekly wellness digestfrom the best health experts in the businessEnter your email Join now Please enter a valid email address.

Meningiomas usually form well-circumscribed lesions but, rarely, can be more diffuse - eg, when they grow next to the sphenoid ridge and are called 'meningioma en plaque'. Meningiomas occur either intracranially or within the spinal canal. Meningiomas can be graded in various ways - eg, site of origin, encroachment of surrounding tissues and histological grading. The most common system used is the World Health Organization (WHO) classification:[1]Grade I (generally benign): meningothelial, psammomatous, secretory, fibroblastic, angiomatous, lymphoplasmacyte-rich, transitional, microcystic, metaplastic.Grade II (there is a higher rate of recurrence after surgery, especially if a resection is incomplete): clear-cell, chordoid, atypical. Chordoid type has been associated with Castleman's disease (an uncommon lymphoproliferative disorder).Grade III (anaplastic): papillary (rare and mostly seen in children), rhabdoid and anaplastic. Grade III meningiomas are malignant with a high rate of local invasion, recurrence and metastases.Epidemiology[2]They are the most common tumours in the central nervous system, accounting for about one-third of all adult central nervous system tumours.[3, 4]The reported annual incidence of cerebral meningiomas ranges from 1.3/100,000 to 7.8/100,000.[5]There is a female:male ratio of 2:1.2-3% of the population have asymptomatic meningiomas and 8% have multiple meningiomas.Aetiology and risk factorsAetiology is not known and most cases are sporadic.[1]Some are increased in the presence of certain genetic disorders - eg, loss of chromosome 22 and presence of neurofibromatosis type 2.[1, 6]Other risk factors include advanced age, cranial irradiation, head injury and breast cancer (although causality not determined).[2, 3]Site (the most common first)Skull vault.Skull base - eg, sphenoid wing and petrous ridge.Sites of dural reflection - eg, falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli.Optic nerve sheath.Choroid plexus.Spine (rarely).Outside the craniospinal axis (very rarely) - eg, the ear, temporal bone and foot.Proliferation markersProliferation markers provide information on the likelihood of recurrence. For example, MIB-1 and Ki67 are found in higher levels of tumours that are likely to recur.[2, 7] However, further work is needed to clarify the role of proliferation markers and prognosis.Meningiomas can also express progesterone receptors.[8]Higher levels of progesterone receptors have been reported to be associated with a lower frequency of recurrence and a better prognosis.More than 70% of meningiomas express somatostatin receptors which can be used with radiological imaging, especially when looking for local recurrence.[2, 9]PresentationMeningiomas present as a space-occupying lesion.Seizures - focal or generalised are common with meningiomas.Raised intracranial pressure effects - eg, obstructive hydrocephalus with headache.Neuropsychological effects - eg, change in personality and disinhibition in frontal lesions.Neurological features - eg, cranial nerve palsies depending on location of a meningioma or language dysfunction.Transient ischaemic attack and intracranial haemorrhage may also be seen.Meningiomas that compress the visual pathways cause visual field defects.Other rare presentations include:Meningiomas near the sella turcica may produce panhypopituitarism.Spinal meningiomas may cause Brown-Séquard's syndrome.Differential diagnosisThis is as for space-occupying lesions. Meningiomas can be discovered incidentally when patients are investigated for other conditions. Other lesions which may also affect the dura mater include:Other primary brain tumours.Metastases from lymphoma and adenocarcinoma.Inflammatory disorders - eg, sarcoidosis.Infections - eg, tuberculosis.InvestigationsImaging - MRI is superior to CT scanning as it shows the dural origin. Meningiomas are well-defined, extra-axial lesions. They may show central cystic degeneration and oedema of nearby white matter.Endovascular angiography allows pre-operative assessment of the blood supply of the tumour and its proximity to vital vascular structures.Biopsy - stereotactic biopsy via a skull burr-hole or open exploration (craniotomy).ManagementManagement will depend on the clinical presentation, age of the patient, site of the tumour and size of the tumour. For example, an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities who is discovered incidentally to have a small, asymptomatic meningioma, can be managed conservatively. This usually consists of yearly MRI scans for three years and then just clinical follow-up if nothing new has developed.[2]Endovascular embolisationThis involves embolisation of the blood supply to the meningioma - eg, coil or glue applied endovascularly to the meningeal artery.[10]This is usually performed before surgical removal, as it reduces the amount of blood loss.[11]It has also been performed as the primary therapy in those unsuitable for surgery.Embolisation usually causes necrosis of the meningioma, which can cause some histological doubt when specimens are examined postoperatively.[2]Surgical removalThe tumour and its dural base are removed. Total excision is the aim but this is not always technically possible.Surgery may be complicated by invasion into local structures - eg, parasagittal tumours invading into the cerebral dural sinus.Stereotactic radiosurgery can provide excellent local tumour control.RadiotherapyRadiotherapy is used in the following:Incomplete resection.Following recurrence of meningioma.High-grade meningiomas with atypia or anaplasia on histology.In these clinical scenarios the use of radiotherapy is associated with a better outcome. For example, in one study stereotactic radiosurgery was associated with better tumour control (approximately 10%) and fewer complications.[12] However, a recent paper has shed some doubt on how useful radiotherapy is in meningiomas.[13]Stereotactic application of radiotherapy has further benefits compared with traditional radiotherapy. This includes less damage to undiseased tissue and better five-year control rates.[2, 14, 15]Radiotherapy is successful and may be used as the primary therapy for tumours, especially inaccessible meningiomas - eg, optic nerve lesions.[2]Chemotherapy and molecular agentsChemotherapy has so far shown disappointing results and has been reserved for when surgery and radiotherapy have failed to control the disease.Chemotherapeutic regimens involving hydroxyurea have been used but with little success.[16, 17]Other drugs studied include temozolomide, RU-486 and interferon alfa, which have also shown disappointing results.More novel molecular targets are being researched.[18, 19]PrognosisAtypical and anaplastic types of meningiomas can rarely metastasise.Completely resected meningiomas usually have an excellent prognosis. The five-year survival for typical meningiomas is more than 80%; however, this falls to below 60% in malignant and atypical meningiomas.[17]Are you protected against flu?See if you are eligible for a free NHS flu jab today.Check nowJoin our weekly wellness digestfrom the best health experts in the businessEnter your email Join now Please enter a valid email address.

Search Health Info Skin Cancer Types Features Added to Saved itemsWhen to worry about a mole Save Remove from Saved Print Share FeedbackGenerally, moles are harmless features of your skin, which will never cause any issues. But in some cases, UV exposure from the sun can cause a mole to change shape, size or colour and become cancerous. We explore what you need to look out for. Last updated by Natalie Healey Peer reviewed by Dr Sarah Jarvis MBE Last updated 22 Jun 2018 Originally published 22 Jun 2018 5 mins readWe're growing more aware of the dangers of the sun's rays and how important covering up and applying sun cream is, but melanoma skin cancer rates are still increasing. So it's important we all get into the habit of checking our skin regularly.""In the ‘good old days’, when a tan was a sign of a healthy outdoor life and holidays abroad were a novelty, many of us paid the price of wanting a tan. Some of us never got further than the peeling sunburn; some became addicted to sunbeds or spent every free hour in the sun. If any of those sounds like you, you need to be especially aware of the warning signs of skin cancer. But even if it doesn't, you need to look out for the signs,"" says Dr Sarah Jarvis, Patient.info's clinical director.What are moles?Moles form when pigment-producing cells in the skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. Most moles are flat, but sometimes they can be raised, and can range from pink, brown to black depending on your skin colour.""Most moles will develop on the body during the first 30 years of someone's life, and they can often change due to hormonal fluctuations. Moles are more common and prominent in fairer-skinned people, and may darken after exposure to the sun, during the teen years, and during pregnancy,"" explains dermatologist Dr Sharon Wong from the London Bridge Hospital, which is part of HCA Healthcare UK. Our picks for When to worry about a mole Your essential skin cancer checklistFollowing her diagnosis of a malignant melanoma, the Duchess of York has spoken about the impo... 5min Your essential skin cancer checklist 5min Why is skin cancer on the rise among older adults? 5min Should you wear sunscreen even when it's cloudy? 5min Why are men less likely to wear sun cream? 7minHow can a mole lead to cancer?UV light from the sun or using sunbeds can change the structure of a mole and increase the chance of it becoming cancerous. This is known as melanoma.""Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, which can spread to other organs in the body. The most common sign of melanoma is a change in an existing or new mole. The mole may also be larger than normal and can sometimes be itchy or bleed,"" reveals Wong.Of course, not all new, enlarged or changing moles will mean skin cancer. But you should keep an eye on them just in case.""Making a habit of examining your own skin on a monthly basis will help to detect any abnormal growths quickly. I always advise my patients to check their skin after they have had a bath or a shower, in a well-lit room with a full-length mirror,"" Wong adds.Jarvis says: ""Malignant melanoma can affect adults of all ages, and accounts for 90% of skin cancer deaths despite being about 20 times less common than other skin cancers. The biggest risk factor is skin damage, particularly from burning and especially in childhood. A combination of pale skin and a hot climate is particularly risky. Most moles are nothing to worry about, but see your doctor immediately if a mole changes or you don't pass the ABCDE test.""What to look forWong also recommends the ABCDE test, which is a handy guide to remembering what to spot.AsymmetryIs the mole symmetrical? Look out for changes in pigment, texture or shape from one half of the mole to the other.BorderA non-cancerous mole will usually have smooth, even borders, and you can see clearly where the mole ends and normal skin begins. You should look out for uneven formations and rough edges or lack of clarity between the edge of the mole and the skin that surrounds it.ColourMost non-cancerous moles are a single shade of brown, so if a mole is showing a number of colours this could be a warning sign.DiameterMelanomas are usually larger than 6 mm. If a mole is bigger than this you may want to consider having it checked out.EvolvingNon-cancerous moles don't usually change shape or appearance, so if one of your moles is starting to evolve you should definitely book to seek your GP. Also, be aware of any new symptoms such as bleeding, itching or crusting.But don't fret if you find the self-checking process tricky, or you've found some irregular moles or patches of skin. Book an appointment with your GP who will be able to review your moles and determine if any should be removed or investigated further.How to reduce your skin cancer riskStay safe this year and don't skimp on sun cream. Wong says you need to find one with good UVA and UVB protection. Both types of ray can cause damage to the skin and increase the risk of skin cancer. And cosmetically, UVA can age the skin, resulting in deep wrinkling and dark spots.And remember, there's no such thing as a healthy tan.""Unfortunately, there is still a perception within our society that having a tan looks 'healthy'. Due to this, many people apply low-factor sun cream when out in the sun, or don't apply any at all, in order to bronze their skin. I always advise my patients to use between factor 30-50 sun creams with 5* UVA cover, and to apply large amounts every two hours,"" says Wong.""I also advise that people should avoid sunbeds at all costs. The UV rays from sunbeds can damage the DNA in your skin cells, and over time this damage can build up to cause skin cancer. Fake tan products are a great option for people who want a darker skin tone, without the long-lasting damage,"" she concludes.Read nextWhat it's like to be diagnosed with skin cancerAre you protected against flu?See if you are eligible for a free NHS flu jab today.Check nowJoin our weekly wellness digestfrom the best health experts in the businessEnter your email Join now Please enter a valid email address.

Bad breath caused by germs (halitosis) In This Article Common Causes of Bad BreathIn this article What causes bad breath? Bad breath caused by germs (halitosis) What causes bad breath?Morning bad breathMost people have some degree of bad breath after a night's sleep. This is normal and occurs because the mouth tends to get dry and stagnate overnight. This usually clears when the flow of saliva increases soon after starting to eat breakfast.Dry mouth (xerostomia)Bad breath associated with a dry mouth is caused by a reduction in the cleansing mechanism of the mouth as a result of reduced flow of saliva from the salivary glands. There are many causes of a dry mouth contributing to bad breath. The most common cause is after a night's sleep (discussed above). Dry mouth may also occur:Due to a lack of fluid in the body (dehydration).As a side-effect of some medicines (for example, tricyclic antidepressants).As a symptom of some diseases (such as Sjögren's syndrome).Following radiotherapy to the head and neck region.Artificial saliva is available; all can be bought over the counter at pharmacies and some can be prescribed on the NHS for certain conditions.Foods, drinks and medicinesChemicals in foods can get into the bloodstream and then be breathed out from the lungs. Most people are familiar with the smell of garlic, spicy foods and alcoholic drinks on the breath of people who have recently eaten or drunk these. Various other foods and medicines can cause bad breath. This type of bad breath is temporary and easily cured by not eating the food.If a medicine is the cause of bad breath, then discuss possible alternatives with your doctor. Medicines that have been associated with bad breath include:Betel.Chloral hydrate.Nitrites and nitrates.Dimethyl sulfoxide.Disulfiram.Some chemotherapy medicines.Phenothiazines.Amfetamines.Lithium.'Water' tablets (diuretics).Bisphosphonates.Check the list of side-effects on the leaflet that comes with your medicine if you think it might be causing bad breath.SmokingMost non-smokers can tell if a person is a smoker by their breath. . Stopping smoking is the only cure for this type of bad breath. Smoking tobacco products also increases the risk of developing gum disease - another cause of bad breath.DietsCrash dieting or fasting can cause a sickly sweet smell on the breath. This is due to chemicals called ketones being made by the breakdown of fat. Some ketones are then breathed out with each breath. Low-carbohydrate and keto diets also can cause this sort of bad breath.Medical causesMedical causes, other than health problems in the mouth, are relatively uncommon. Possible causes include:Nasal problems. For example, a lump (polyp) in the nose or a small object stuck in a nostril (occurs most commonly in children) can cause a bad smell. In this situation, the smell tends to occur only, or more severely, when you breathe out through your nose. It is not so noticeable when you breathe out through your mouth.Sinus infections.Throat infections such as tonsillitis.Mouth infections, such as dental abscesses.Infections or tumours of the lung.Bronchiectasis.Reflux of acid from the stomach or a stomach infection called Helicobacter pylori.Diabetes.Severe kidney or liver problems.Fish odour syndrome (trimethylaminuria). This is a rare medical cause but worth being aware of. It typically causes breath and body odour that is often like a fishy smell. It occurs because the body loses the ability to properly break down trimethylamine which is found in certain foods. There is then a build-up of trimethylamine in the body which is released in sweat, urine and breath. Urine and blood tests can help to confirm this diagnosis if it is suspected.In these medical cases, there are usually other symptoms that would indicate the cause. For example, a blocked nose, sinus pain, chest symptoms, a high temperature (fever), etc. If you are otherwise well and have no other symptoms apart from bad breath, the smell is likely to be coming from a build-up of bacteria in the mouth and other medical causes are unlikely.Bad breath caused by germs (halitosis)In most people who have bad breath (halitosis), the bad smell is thought to come from germs (bacteria) and debris within the mouth.As the bacteria break down proteins and other debris in the mouth, they release foul-smelling gases. One or more of the following may contribute to the build-up of bacteria, debris and bad breath:Food stuck between teeth and gumsNormal teeth brushing may not clear bits of food which can get stuck between teeth. The food then rots and becomes riddled with bacteria. In addition to regular cleaning with fluoride toothpaste, flossing between the teeth (or using interdental brushes) can clear and prevent this problem.If you wear dentures, they should be removed and cleaned every night.Plaque, tartar (calculus) and gum diseaseDental plaque is a soft whitish deposit that forms on the surface of teeth. It forms when bacteria combine with food and saliva. Plaque contains many types of bacteria. Calculus is hardened calcified plaque. It sticks firmly to teeth. Gum disease means infection or inflammation of the tissues that surround the teeth. If your gums look inflamed, or regularly bleed when you clean your teeth, you are likely to have gum disease. The severity can range from mild to severe.There is some evidence that antibacterial mouthwashes (such as those containing chlorhexidine) may also be useful in preventing bad breath. Be aware that these may discolour your teeth or dentures. These can be bought over the counter.Coating on the back of the tongueIn some people, a coating develops on the back part of the tongue. It is not clear why this occurs. It may be from mucus that drips down from the back of the nose (postnasal drip). The coating can contain many bacteria. This explains why bad breath can sometimes occur in people with otherwise good oral hygiene. It is recommended that the tongue is cleaned every night with a proper utensil (such as a tongue scraper), rather than a toothbrush.Tonsil stones (tonsilloliths)Tonsil stones are are clusters of calcified material that form in the tonsillar crypts, or crevices of the tonsils. They are made up mostly of calcium but can contain other ingredients such as magnesium and phosphorus, and can feel like a small lump in the tonsils. Rarely harmful, they can be a nuisance and hard to remove and can often cause bad breath.Previous article Halitosis (Bad Breath)Are you protected against flu?See if you are eligible for a free NHS flu jab today.Check nowJoin our weekly wellness digestfrom the best health experts in the businessEnter your email Join now Please enter a valid email address.

When Should You Consider Botox Treatment for Your Overactive Bladder?FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail6 years ago| by Sheree McDonald Botox Treatment for Overactive BladderOveractive bladder (OAB) is the frequent or sudden urge to urinate with little or no ability to control urination.While OAB is not life-threatening, it can cause an enormous amount of embarrassment or hesitation to participate in regular activities. For some individuals, symptoms of OAB simply become a way of life. However, this does not have to be the case. There are treatment plans that will work.While some people may feel like they should suffer in silence, this is not an option you should consider. Know that proper diagnosis will help find the best treatment plan.Typical plans may include:Establishing a fluid intake scheduleLearning bladder-holding techniquesUsing anticholinergic drugsUsing Botox as treatment for overactive bladderThe last option may surprise you a bit. After all, most people use Botox to get rid of fine lines and wrinkles brought on by aging. However, the same properties in Botox that help firm the face can also be used to strengthen the bladder.How Botox for OAB WorksThere are a variety of medications for OAB symptoms that have been around for years.However, in recent years, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Botox as a treatment plan for individuals who do not respond well to traditional medications used for OAB. Some of these medications cause unfavorable side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and even memory loss.Essentially, Botox works to settle the nerves in the bladder muscle that are often overstimulated in individuals who suffer from OAB. The medication is injected directly into the bladder muscle for optimal results.Botox injections are convenient as they can be administered in your doctor’s offer in a matter of minutes. Afterward, you will be asked to wait for about 30 minutes and until you urinate to ensure that you do not have a reaction to the shot and that your bladder is operating correctly.A single Botox injection usually lasts up to eight months. However, your doctor will be able to evaluate the frequency of the injections based on your tolerance and how well your body responds to the treatment.The FDA does not have a suggested timeline for how long you should use Botox therapy to treat OAB, but they do suggest that each injection should be at least 12 weeks apart.Related Search Topics Control Bladder LeakageNatural Bladder ControlBladder Control SupplementsBladder Leakage Women You May Also LikeIs Cranberry Juice Good or Bad for Overactive Bladder?BlogIs Cranberry Juice Good or Bad for Overactive Bladder?5 years ago| by Natalie SaundersIs cranberry juice good for overactive bladder? Cranberry juice isn't actually good or beneficial to people living with OAB, and here are the reason why.Expected ResultsOf course, as with any treatment, results will vary. However, studies have indicated that most patients will see a considerable difference in symptoms in about two weeks following the injection.Incontinence is reported to have significantly decreased after one month following the treatment and often remains that way for at least a year.However, it is also noted that some people will have multiple injections per year while others will only have a single dose. Some of this depends on the severity of your OAB symptoms and how well your body responds to the treatment.Potential Side EffectsWhile many individuals have experienced a great benefit of using Botox to treat OAB symptoms, there are some possible side effects.The most notable side effects are that some people experience more urinary tract infections with prolonging Botox use. It should be noted that dry mouth, which is a common side effect in other OAB medications, is not linked to the use of Botox injections. However, other patients experience no side effects at all.What sets this option apart is that Botox injections are only done sporadically while other medications must be administered daily making it a much more convenient choice than different treatment plans.Speak With a Medical ProfessionalIf you suspect that you have OAB, you should discuss treatment options with your doctor. While Botox is undoubtedly an advantageous choice, this treatment plan is usually chosen if other medications do not work.Now, people have another option for relief of symptoms that interrupt their daily life.

On the top of the list of bladder irritants is alcohol, followed closely by caffeine-based products. Let’s review how your bladder works, the influence of alcohol and what other drinks or foods you should avoid to keep your bladder healthy and happy.How the Bladder WorksYour kidneys help filter waste products from the blood. They make urine, which is passed down to the bladder. The bladder is situated in the lower part of the abdomen and acts as a temporary store for the urine. It has muscles that allow it to expand as it fills with urine.When the bladder starts to fill up, the nerves that control it send signals telling you to go to the toilet. This simple mechanism does not work properly in cases of overactive bladder, leading to the characteristic symptoms.How Alcohol Influences the Urinary SystemThere are a few ways in which alcohol impacts overactive bladder symptoms. Firstly, it is a liquid and therefore will make you urinate more. It is also a diuretic, meaning that will make your body eliminate more fluids/urine from the body and do so faster than regular liquids and forcing the bladder to empty more often. And thirdly, alcohol irritates the already overactive and sensitive bladder, and may also have an impact on how the kidneys work.Additionally, the nerves that control the bladder emptying process may be affected by alcohol, thus making the bladder fill up without creating the sensation you need to urinate. As a result, leakages will occur. Lastly, alcohol reduces the quality and quantity of your sleep and makes you more likely to wake up and go to the washroom at night.Related Search Topics Control Bladder LeakageNatural Bladder ControlBladder Control SupplementsBladder Leakage Women You May Also LikeBladder Training for Overactive BladderBlogBladder Training for Overactive Bladder9 years ago| by Pat BratianuBladder training for overactive bladder is a widely used form of treatment.Different types of alcohol will create different problems. Among alcoholic beverages beer seems to cause more problems, compared with wine or hard liquors.If you drink more than that occasional glass of wine on the weekend, you should consider cutting down on alcohol. Not only your bladder will function better, but your whole body will be healthier. Set up small goals (i.e. drinking a few drinks less every week) and keep track of any alcoholic beverage you have.Count and measure the drinks, especially when drinking at home and you have a full bottle available. One standard drink is 12 ounces of beer, 1.5 ounces of spirits or 5 ounces of wine. Avoid “triggers” that make you more likely to drink – like certain people or certain places. Finally, try to eat some food with fat when you drink alcohol. This way the alcohol will be slower absorbed in the body, and therefore less irritating.Alcohol Is Not the Only ProblemReducing or even completely eliminating alcohol from your diet is a good step towards better management of your OAB, but that alone is not enough. There are other drinks that irritate your bladder and cause aggravation of your symptoms.Like alcohol, caffeine is a diuretic. It relaxes the muscles that control the bladder and thus will aggravates the symptoms of urgency and frequency. If consumed in excess and/or late in the day, caffeine will also interfere with your sleep, creating the similar problems during the night as the alcohol.If you go cold turkey and completely cut caffeine out, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, irritability and drowsiness. The best way to cut down on coffee is to gradually reduce its consumption: decrease the number of cups you drink during the day, combine full strength coffee with decaf or switch to green tea.Fruit juices are usually acidic (i.e. orange, grapefruit) and thus will irritate the bladder and make you have to urinate more often. Cranberry juice is known to be healthy and help prevent infections, but is also irritating to the bladder and is best avoided.When it comes to herbal teas, different plants will have different effects. Some have strong diuretic properties and should be avoided. Chamomile and ginger teas are safe choices due to their anti-inflammatory qualities, as long as they are consumed in moderation.Added sugar and artificial sweeteners can also trigger OAB symptoms. Bubbly drinks are not only carbonated, but loaded with sugar, encouraging the growth of bacteria and therefore the chances of infections. Many of them contain caffeine as well, and irritate the bladder, increasing the risk of urgency and frequency.Keeping HydratedNot drinking enough, can also be detrimental because the urine becomes more concentrated and more irritating for the bladder. But how much is too much? Rather than focus on those 8-10 glasses of water a day you’ve heard is healthy, you should check the color of the urine when you go to the washroom. If is very light yellow or white – and clear, you had enough water. If is darker, simply have an extra glass of water.Do you have to eliminate completely alcohol from your diet or just cutting down on it? Some people are OK having that occasional drink during the weekend. If you are not sure, try to not drink any alcohol for one week. If your OAB symptoms improve significantly, it would be a great idea to avoid alcohol altogether. If your symptoms don’t change, it means that you can probably enjoy that drink – just try to have wine or 40% spirits rather than beer, along with some food and extra water.ResourcesU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Tips for Cutting Down on Drinking)Guy's and St.Thomas' (Drinking Fluids and How They Affect your Bladder)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsOveractive Bladder LivingTreating Overactive Bladder Symptoms With AntidepressantsOveractive Bladder Symptoms10 Treatment Options for Overactive BladderOveractive Bladder LivingHow Physiotherapy for OAB Can HelpOveractive Bladder LivingWhat to Know About Overactive Bladder and ObesityOveractive Bladder Living9 Ways to Reduce OAB EmbarrassmentOveractive Bladder LivingWhat Causes You to Leak Urine When You Cough?you may also likeBlogWhen Should You Consider Botox Treatment for Your Overactive Bladder?Blog9 Ways to Stay Positive Despite OABBlogIs Cranberry Juice Good or Bad for Overactive Bladder?BlogManaging the Emotional Impacts of OABconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsOABLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Of this 25 million, 75% to 80% are women. Though urinary incontinence is most common in women who are over 50, approximately 24% of women between the ages of 18 and 44 experience some type of symptom too.Overactive Bladder SymptomsThere are a variety of symptoms that may signify that you may be experiencing OAB. These symptoms might include: the urge to urinate, loss of urine control, frequent peeing during nighttime and frequent urination. If any of these symptoms apply to you, it would be good to discuss this with your doctor.What Causes Overactive Bladder?OAB causes the muscles of the bladder to contract involuntarily. This occurs even when the volume in the bladder is low. When this occurs, there is an urgent need to urinate.These various medical conditions may cause OAB:DiabetesStrokeMultiple sclerosisUrinary tract infectionsHormonal changes, such as menopauseTumors or bladder stonesEnlarged prostate glandConstipationHow to Prevent Overactive BladderPracticing a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of experiencing OAB symptoms. If you smoke, it would be smart to quit. Also, make sure to maintain a healthy weight, get lots of exercise and limit your alcohol and caffeine intake.Related Search Topics Bladder Leakage WomenBladder Control in WomenIncontinence Treatment WomenNatural Bladder Control You May Also LikeOveractive Bladder and AlcoholBlogOveractive Bladder and Alcohol9 years ago| by Brenda VantaThere are a few ways in which alcohol impacts overactive bladder symptoms.An Overview of YogaYoga, created from the Sanskrit word “yuj”, means “…to yoke or bind, and is often interpreted as ‘union’ or a method of discipline.”People in the U.S. and Canada download apps, follow YouTube classes and join yoga classes in studios or gyms. We’re perfecting our crow pose or resting in savasana. We’re practicing asana, or the physical postures of yoga.However, there are eight limbs of yoga:Yamas (restraints)Niyamas (observances)Asanas (observances)Pranayama (breath)Pratyahara (withdrawal of senses)Dharana (concentration)Dhyani (meditation)Samadhi (absorption)Depending on your own personal practice, the typical person may only be practicing asana, pranayama and dhyani.How Can Yoga Help Overactive Bladder?It is no secret that the physical practice of yoga is not only beneficial for our mental health, but also for our physical health. There are various yoga postures that may be helpful in improving OAB symptoms.Cobbler’s PoseCobbler’s pose is often performed during the warm up or cool down portion of a yoga practice, but it can be done anytime you feel like you need a good stretch. This pose benefits the bladder because it improves circulation in general. It also promotes circulation to the pelvis because of how the stretch is performed; because of the blood circulating to the pelvis, the nerves are better oxygenated.Here’s how to perform Cobbler’s pose:Sit on the floor or a mat, stretching the legs forward.Bending the knees, bring the soles of the feet together. With a straight back, grab the big toe and pull the feet as close to the perineum as possible.Hold the pose for one to three minutes.This pose is similar to butterfly pose, but the outside of the legs should remain on the ground.Reclined Wide-Legged Pose VariationThis pose helps with pelvic contractions, improving pelvic strength and bladder control. Not only does it assist with strengthening the pelvic floor, it can be incredibly relaxing, especially if you allow yourself time to rest.Here’s how to perform reclined wide-legged pose:Bring a mat flush to the wall. Lie on the mat with the buttocks against the wall, allowing the legs to extend upwards. Your body should be in an L shape.Place the hands on the low belly, spread the legs and inhale while the lower abdomen relaxes along with the pelvic floor.While exhaling, bring the knees back together.This exercise should be performed 10 times.Chair PoseChair pose builds strength in the pelvic floor while focusing on stabilization and alignment.Here’s how to perform chair pose:Grounding your feet into your mat or the earth, look down to ensure that your ankles and knees are aligned.Tuck your tailbone in, pull your belly button into the spine and slowly bring your bottom down to a sitting position.While “sitting”, your head should be in line with your pelvic floor.Gradually bring your arms up, palms facing each other.Hold for several breaths, then release, coming forward into a forward fold.Talk to Your DoctorIf you experience the mentioned symptoms and believe you suffer from OAB, make sure to talk to your doctor so they can guide you in the proper course of treatment.ResourcesAZO (Be Thankful: Yoga Can Help Bladder Control Issues)Mayo Clinic (Overactive bladder)Phoenix Physical Therapy (Urinary Incontinence Statistics)Yoga Journal (Yoga 101: A Beginner's Guide to Practice, Meditation, and the Sutras)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsOveractive Bladder Symptoms7 Warning Signs of Overactive BladderOveractive Bladder LivingEffective Symptom Relief: Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation for Overactive BladderOveractive Bladder LivingWhat Causes You to Leak Urine When You Cough?Overactive Bladder Living8 Great Foods For Your Overactive Bladder DietOveractive Bladder LivingBathroom Troubles?

Herbs reduce irritability of the tissues in the bladder and promote relaxation, and can also tone tissues and relieve inflammation.Here are some of the best herbs to use if you have OAB.1. Corn Silk (Zea Mays)Corn silk is my hands down favorite herb for relieving discomfort, spasms and irritability of the bladder. The simplest way to reap the benefits of corn silk is to buy fresh ears of corn, organic if possible. The silk that you need is the light colored part. The dried, brown silk is far less effective.Place a tablespoon or more of fresh corn silk in a cup. Pour one cup of boiled water over the silk. Place a cover on the cup and let the silk steep for 20 minutes before straining out the corn silk. Drink as mmuch of the light, slightly corn-flavored tea as you desire each day.Corn silk tea is also good for urinary tract infections. It won’t cure an infection, but you will experience fewer spasms, a decreased urge to void and markedly less discomfort within one half hour of drinking the tea.You may purchase tinctures or glycerites of corn silk for portable convenience, but I think the tea is superior. The glycerite is my second choice. Don’t use the alcohol-based tincture unless no other forms are available, as alcohol can make your OAB symptoms worse. Follow label instructions, if you are using a commercial product.NextRelated Search Topics Control Bladder LeakageBladder Control SupplementsBladder Leakage WomenNatural Bladder Control You May Also LikeTop 4 Natural Remedies for Overactive BladderOveractive Bladder LivingTop 4 Natural Remedies for Overactive Bladder4 years ago| by Krystina Ostermeyer RN, BSNOveractive bladder home remedies are natural ways to help relieve OAB symptoms.

While poor bladder control doesn’t cause any major health issues, it can lead to some pretty embarrassing moments. Leakage can occur due to an overactive bladder or urinary incontinence.The good news is that this condition is almost always treatable, and is most definitely not a necessary consequence of aging, childbirth, or an unavoidable part of being a woman.Types of Bladder LeakageThere are different types of incontinence:Stress incontinence – caused by laughing, coughing or being overweight. This type of incontinence happens when anything puts pressure on the bladder.Urge incontinence – when there is an intense urge to urinate, and unwillingly you release urine.A mixture of both stress and urge incontinence.Overflow – when the bladder cannot be emptied completely, and therefore it leaks unexpectedly.Causes of Bladder LeakageUrinary incontinence tends to be more frequent in women as pregnancy, labor, and menopause can trigger it. It can also occur to men, due to an enlarged prostate, diabetes, and other conditions such as Parkinson’s disease.10 Ways to Stop Bladder LeakageFortunately, this is a treatable condition, and lifestyle changes play a key role in helping to alleviate symptoms. Here are the ten most effective strategies for stopping bladder leaks.1. Pelvic Floor ExercisesBladder leakage is often the result of weak pelvic floor muscles, which can be strengthened. Kegel exercises are the most widely known technique for strengthening these muscles. Pelvic floor muscles support not only the bladder but also the uterus, small intestine, and rectum.These exercises can be practiced even during pregnancy and after childbirth to prevent incontinence. Results can be seen after a few weeks, but for best results, they should be part of your daily routine. Pelvic floor exercises can be done anytime, anywhere: while sitting at the office without anyone noticing, as well as lying down and standing.For women, there are even vagina weights to boost their effect further.2. Electrical StimulationMany individuals have trouble sensing their pelvic muscles, and they mistakenly activate their abdominals and gluteus instead.This is where electrical stimulation can help – by placing a small electrode inside the vagina or rectum and delivering an electric current, the pelvic floor muscles will contract.This therapy can be done at a doctor’s office, but also in the comfort of your own home thanks to home versions of these machines, offering a range of different strengths and time intervals.3. Increase fiber intakeThis dietary ingredient resolves constipation, which is one of the triggers of urinary incontinence. Fiber is found in:Whole-grain productsVegetables, such as avocadoPeas, lentils and other beansNuts and seedsAccording to the Institute of Medicine, general intake recommendations are 25 grams for women up to the age of 50 years, and 21 grams for those over 50 years. For men, the recommendations are 38 grams up to the age of 50 years, and 30 grams for those over 50 years. This is a very easy target to achieve, just think of a salad topped with flax seeds or pumpkin seeds.Most importantly, fiber works best when it absorbs water so make sure you drink plenty of water for your stool to be soft and formed.4. Avoid IrritantsCaffeine, alcohol and carbonated drinks have been shown to irritate the bladder and make bladder leakage symptoms worse as they make you want to urinate more. The same goes for energy drinks as they also interfere with brain signals and consequently when you need to urinate.Another dietary change is to avoid acidic, spicy foods and sweets. Acidic fruits such as lemons are found by some to worsen the condition so you should also avoid citrus teas. Ketchup and tomato sauces are a no-no, but surprisingly, even pineapple belongs to this group, and regrettably, chocolate has both caffeine and acid.Related Search Topics Control Bladder LeakageBladder Control SupplementsBladder Leakage WomenNatural Bladder Control You May Also LikeHow Can Kegel Exercises Help Overactive Bladder?Overactive Bladder LivingHow Can Kegel Exercises Help Overactive Bladder?5 years ago| by Olivia RobbinKegel exercises are often overlooked as being a form of treatment for anyone with overactive bladder. Here's how to do Kegels for overactive bladder.The choices you make greatly depend on your tolerance, so it may take a little trial and error to see what irritates your symptoms. For example, if you think caffeine is a problem, try switching to decaffeinated coffee for a while and see if your symptoms improve.After a trial period, try restoring regular coffee in small amounts and see if the symptoms worsen. You can do this will all possible irritants to see what foods and drinks worsen your symptoms.5. Maintain Healthy Vitamin D and Magnesium LevelsMany people are deficient in the sunshine vitamin, and studies show that women with sufficient vitamin D are less likely to suffer from pelvic floor disorders. The recommended daily amount is 600 IU.On the other hand, magnesium has been shown to ease muscle spasms and therefore help the bladder empty completely, resolving sleepless nights due to incontinence. Some magnesium-rich foods are:SesameBananasPotatoes and starchIf you opt for supplements, your doctor should be consulted first.6. Stop SmokingA chronic cough is common in smokers and besides being a risk factor for cancer as it aggravates the bladder and can worsen bladder leakage. Urge incontinence is three times more common in women who smoke than in those who do not, supporting studies that heavy smokers are at greater risk of incontinence.7. Hydrate ProperlyToo much water can worsen the condition; yet too little can also make it worse, as it could lead to UTIs. The recommendation is to drink smaller glasses of water at intervals throughout the day rather than sipping all day and to avoid drinking water at least 2 hours before bedtime.8. Reduce StressLearning relaxation techniques can also help in learning how to control the pelvic floor muscles and is therefore advisable.Learning how to breathe properly, meditate, or simply practicing mindfulness may be a good start as stress and an already troubled bladder are a bad combination.9. Train Your BladderTry following a strict bathroom schedule, such as going every few hours to prevent your bladder from overflowing. If you feel the urge to urinate before the scheduled time, try to hold it for a few minutes more by tightening your muscles so you can achieve longer periods between bathroom visits.10. Take Care of Your BodyBe active and maintain a healthy weight. When overweight, the pressure on the abdomen is greatly increased, as is the pressure on the bladder. Multiple studies have shown that walking or swimming for just 30 minutes a day may greatly improve bladder control.ConclusionAll of the above strategies work best when they are exercised continuously. Track your progress and make a note of any leaking to make the connection.No recipe is universal, and everyone has a unique formula for success, which is a lot easier to find once the cause of your bladder leakage is discovered.ResourcesWebMD (Types of Urinary Incontinence)NHS (Urinary Incontinence)Mayo Clinic (Urinary Incontinence)WebMD (Tame Your Bladder When You Have MS)Mayo Clinic (Nutrition and Healthy Eating)Urology Care Foundation (What is Overactive Bladder)Harvard Health (More on Strengthening the Pelvic Floor)Everyday Health (Can Smoking Cause Embarrassing Bladder Problems)Health Communities (Overactive Bladder Management)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsOveractive Bladder SymptomsIs Your Child Bedwetting or Do They Have OAB?Blog9 Ways to Stay Positive Despite OABBlogManaging the Emotional Impacts of OABOveractive Bladder SymptomsOAB in MenOveractive Bladder Symptoms7 Warning Signs of Overactive BladderBlogOveractive Bladder and Alcoholyou may also likeOveractive Bladder LivingTreating Overactive Bladder Symptoms With AntidepressantsOveractive Bladder Living8 Great Foods For Your Overactive Bladder DietOveractive Bladder Living6 Wonderful Herbs for Overactive Bladder TreatmentOveractive Bladder LivingWhat Causes You to Leak Urine When You Cough?connect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsOABLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Usually starting out as small, benign polyps or growths in the colon, colon cancer has the potential to grow beyond control and spread throughout the body.[[1]] Colon cancer is treatable. With early detection from regular screenings, many people can identify colon cancer at an early stage and get lifesaving treatment in time to make a full recovery. One of the keys to early detection is to identify these 10 symptoms of colon cancer and to meet regularly with a doctor for cancer screenings. Persistent Diarrhea or ConstipationPolyps are growths inside the colon, and they may be small or large. They can irritate the bowel lining or block the flow of waste through the colon, which often causes noticeable symptoms. People with a bowel lining irritated by cancerous growths may struggle with diarrhea that lasts longer than a few days or comes and goes without apparent cause. Constipation is another common colon cancer symptom, as blockages or loss of function slow down the bowels.[[2]] Advertisement Recent Posts health 10 canker sore home remedies health 10 colon cancer symptoms health 10 constipation causes Changes to Normal Bowel MovementsApart from diarrhea or constipation, any unexplained changes to normal bowel function may be a sign of trouble. Having to defecate more often or less often, irregular bowel movements, or a sudden change in texture or composition could be significant.[[3]] There are many reasons why someone might experience a change in their bowel movements. Temporary or one-off changes usually arenât problematic, but any changes that cause distress or canât be explained might merit a cancer screening. Advertisement Advertisement The Urge to Defecate Without a Bowel MovementFeeling the need to defecate without an actual bowel movement is called tenesmus, and it can be a symptom of colon cancer.[[4]] If the feeling persists or happens often, it should be mentioned to a doctor. Occasional tenesmus isnât a worrying sign, and it isnât indicative of cancer if it happens on its own. However, it may require a screening if it occurs in connection with other colon cancer symptoms. Advertisement Cramping or Pain in the AbdomenColon cancer may cause pain or cramping in the abdomen.[[5]] Many conditions cause pain or cramping, including other forms of cancer, so on its own, abdominal pain isnât enough for a determination of colon cancer.[[6]] However, if the pain is severe, localized in the lower abdomen, or has no clear cause, it may be a symptom of colon cancer. This is especially likely if the cancer has advanced or spread beyond the colon. Advertisement Advertisement Feelings of Bloating or Being Full Without EatingColon cancer can occasionally cause unexplained feelings of fullness that arenât connected to actual food intake. This may be related to the endocrine effects of advancing cancer or the physical effect of having a mass growing in the bowel. Bloating is also a potential symptom of colon cancer. While itâs normal to feel bloated on occasion, such as after eating too much or during the menstrual cycle, it shouldnât be persistent or frequent without an apparent cause. Advertisement Changes in AppetiteCancer growth can send out chemical signals that affect the hypothalamus, which regulates appetite.[[7]] When this happens, a person may feel like they have lost their desire to eat. People lose their appetite for many reasons, including infections, colds, fatigue, or other health disruptions. Loss of appetite only becomes a warning sign if it persists beyond a day or so or there are other signs of cancer. Advertisement Advertisement Rectal BleedingRectal bleeding is never a positive sign, but it isnât always serious. People experience mild rectal bleeding for various reasons, including hemorrhoids or minor injuries, although colorectal cancer is also a potential cause. Unexplained blood from the rectum is always worth mentioning to the doctor, who will likely perform an exam. If it only happens once, it may be nothing serious, although repeated unexplained episodes call for immediate medical attention. Advertisement Blood on Stool or Tissue After a Bowel MovementPeople sometimes notice fresh blood on tissue or in the bowl after a bowel movement. This is often caused by hemorrhoids or anal fissures, and while itâs worth mentioning to a doctor, itâs not an emergency if itâs mild and rare. Persistent bleeding when passing stools is a problem, even if cancer isnât the cause. Frequent or routine bleeding associated with bowel movements should always be checked as a potential colon cancer symptom. Advertisement Advertisement Excessive or Severe FatigueEverybody feels tired sometimes, and itâs normal to have occasional bouts of heavy fatigue. If the tiredness is associated with a clear cause, such as exercise or a heavy meal, itâs probably nothing to worry about. Cancer can also cause excessive fatigue, especially in its later stages.[[8]] If a person frequently feels lethargic, or the fatigue or exhaustion interferes with their normal daily activities, a cancer screening may be needed. Advertisement Unexplained Weight LossWeight loss is associated with cancer for many reasons.[[9]] It sometimes results from diminished appetite, cancer treatments, or the cancer draining energy that would otherwise keep up a personâs weight. Weight loss isnât an issue if thereâs an obvious reason for it, such as a new exercise routine or diet changes. However, rapid, unexplained weight loss is never a good sign and may be a symptom of colon cancer.

This narrowing can happen in any of the three spinal regions, including the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. Although it can happen anywhere, spinal stenosis is most common in the cervical and lumbar spine.[[1]] Symptoms of spinal stenosis happen due to nerve damage or pressure on the spine and nearby body structures. The symptoms a person experiences depend on the location of the narrowing and how far itâs progressed. Besides the back and neck, the legs, feet, buttocks, arms, and hands are often affected.[[1]] Advertisement Leg CrampingWhen the narrowing of the spine happens in the lower back, it can cause leg cramping. Cramping may sometimes extend to the feet and can range from mild to severe.[[1]] Sometimes, aching is accompanied by a burning sensation that radiates from the lower back into the buttocks and down the legs. This burning sensation is generally worse when standing or walking and may ease when leaning forward.[[1]] Advertisement Advertisement Next Advertisement Advertisement Next Recent Posts health 10 canker sore home remedies health 10 colon cancer symptoms health 10 constipation causes Advertisement â Explore more health health 10 aortic aneurysm symptoms health 10 brain aneurysm symptoms health 10 bronchitis symptoms The information provided is for educational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice.

Geschwüre treten als Folge von Missverhältnissen der Verdauungssäfte oder einer Beschädigung der Magenschleimhaut (z.B. bei Alkoholismus) auf. Ein Geschwür kann sehr schmerzvoll sein und ist daher kaum ignorierbar. Sollte man es dennoch unbehandelt lassen, kann es sich bis tief in die Magenwand fressen und zu einem perforierten Geschwür werden oder die Blutgefäße befallen, um sich in ein blutendes Geschwür zu verwandeln, was zu gefährlichen, extrem schmerzhaften Gesundheitsproblemen führen kann. Hier sind 15 sehr offensichtliche Anzeichen dafür, dass Sie möglicherweise ein Geschwür haben… 1. Magenschmerzen Abwechselnd brennende und stechende Schmerzen in der Magengegend – typischerweise zwischen Brustbein und Bauchnabel – können bei der Magenentleerung nach dem Essen entstehen. 2. Starke Verdauungsstörungen Ein Geschwür kann starke Verdauungsprobleme und Blähungsschmerzen mit sich bringen, die sich oft durch Aufstoßen und Schluckauf bemerkbar machen. 3. Übelkeit Aufgrund des Missverhältnisses der Verdauungssäfte stellt sich wahrscheinlich ein mehr oder minder schweres Gefühl von Übelkeit ein – insbesondere morgens bei leerem Magen. 4. Schwerer Bauch Oftmals fühlt sich der Bauch schwer und voll an, so, als hätte man zu viel Wasser getrunken oder trage ein Gewicht in sich. 5. Grippeartige Symptome Die meisten Betroffenen verbuchen Symptome wie Müdigkeit, Unwohlsein, Fieber und Übelkeit als Folge einer Grippe. 6. Appetitlosigkeit Die plötzlichen und starken Magenschmerzen, die bei Erkrankten üblicherweise auf die Nahrungsaufnahme folgen, verursachen oftmals Angst vor dem Essen oder sogar totalen Appetitverlust. 7. Unerklärlicher Hunger Entgegengesetzt ist es möglich, bereits wenige Stunden nach einem reichhaltigen Essen quälenden Hunger zu verspüren. Der Schmerz wird jedoch nicht von echtem Hunger verursacht, sondern ist Folge des Magengeschwürs und wird durch die vermehrten Verdauungssäfte verursacht. 8. Plötzlicher Gewichtsverlust Einhergehend mit Appetitlosigkeit tritt bei Betroffenen häufig eine deutliche Gewichtsreduzierung auf. Auch regelmäßiges Erbrechen als Folge des Geschwürs kann dazu führen, dass Sie deutlich an Gewicht verlieren. 9. Verfärbter Stuhl Die Stuhlfarbe kann dunkler oder heller werden und – im Falle eines blutenden Geschwürs – sogar einen Hauch von Blut enthalten. 10. Blut im Erbrochenen Erbrechen ist eine normale Folge eines Geschwürs und der sich daraus ergebenden hohen Menge an Verdauungssäften. Sollte das Erbrochene jedoch Blut enthalten, befindet sich das Geschwür in fortgeschrittenem Zustand und sollte umgehend medizinisch behandelt werden. 11. Völlegefühl und Blähungen Obwohl Menschen mit Magengeschwüren kurz nach dem Verzehr einer großen Mahlzeit ein unglaubliches Hungergefühl verspüren können (wenn sie denn essen), neigen sie dazu, recht schnell satt zu werden, und zwar normalerweise nach dem Verzehr von weit weniger Nahrung als sie es normalerweise tun würden. Zusätzlich zum Völlegefühl können Ulkus-Patienten Blähungen erleben, bei denen der Magen anschwillt, weil er mit Gas oder Luft gefüllt ist. Der NHS weist darauf hin, dass Blähungen besonders häufig nach dem Verzehr von fetthaltigen, z. B. gebratenen Lebensmitteln auftreten können. 12. Anämie Ein Symptom von Geschwüren, das schwieriger zu erkennen sein kann, ist Anämie. Anämie ist eine Störung, die auftritt, wenn dem Körper eine ausreichende Anzahl roter Blutkörperchen fehlt, um die notwendige Menge an Sauerstoff zu den Körperzellen zu transportieren. Aber wie genau sind die beiden Bedingungen miteinander verbunden? Nun, in einigen Fällen können Geschwüre bluten und, wie eMed-icineHealth.com erklärt, „aufgrund des anhaltenden, chronischen, langsamen Blutverlustes geht auch Eisen aus dem Körper (als Teil des Blutes) mit einer höheren Rate als normal verloren und kann zu einer Eisenmangelanämie führen.“ 13. Kurzatmigkeit Kurzatmigkeit ist eigentlich ein Symptom für Anämie, die durch den chronischen Blutverlust eines Geschwürs entstehen kann. Da eine Anämie jedoch schwieriger zu erkennen ist, ohne einen Arzt aufzusuchen, ist Kurzatmigkeit oft das, was am meisten auffällt. Kurzatmigkeit tritt bei Anämie aufgrund eines Mangels an roten Blutkörperchen auf, deren Aufgabe es ist, Sauerstoff zu den Zellen des Körpers zu transportieren, einschließlich derjenigen in der Lunge, wodurch das Atmen erschwert wird. 14. Gefühl der Ohnmacht Ohnmachtsgefühle, Schwindel oder Benommenheit sind weitere Symptome für ein blutendes Geschwür. Dieser ständige Blutverlust kann, wie bereits erwähnt, zu einer Anämie führen, die dazu führen kann, dass einer Person schwindelig wird oder sie sogar ohnmächtig wird. Sie tritt am häufigsten auf, wenn jemand versucht, schnell aufzustehen, nachdem er längere Zeit gesessen oder gelegen hat, und der Körper nicht in der Lage ist, genügend Blut zum Gehirn zu pumpen. Zusätzlich zum Gefühl der Ohnmacht, Benommenheit oder des Schwindels können Menschen, die als Folge eines Geschwürs eine Anämie entwickelt haben, auch Schwäche und übermäßige Müdigkeit verspüren. 15. Unwohlsein im Magen Menschen mit Magengeschwüren können auch Symptome erfahren, die denen von saurem Reflux und Sodbrennen ähneln. Und obwohl sie sich gleich anfühlen mögen, sind sie es nicht. Bei Menschen mit Geschwüren sind die Magenbeschwerden das Ergebnis der Verschlimmerung des Geschwürs durch die Magensäure. Die Säure neigt jedoch nicht dazu, aus dem Magen zurück in die Speiseröhre zu gelangen, wie es bei einem Säurereflux und Sodbrennen der Fall ist. Ein weiterer Unterschied zwischen den Erkrankungen ist, dass die Magenbeschwerden bei Geschwüren eher durch Essen und Trinken gelindert werden, während der Säurereflux in der Regel durch den Verzehr bestimmter Speisen und Getränke ausgelöst wird.

Sufferers have trouble getting to sleep with arthritis, as well as staying asleep, waking early, and the sleep tends to be lighter, restless and unrefreshing.As people get older, they tend to spend more of their sleep time in the lighter phases of sleep, which means they are more likely to be disrupted by the pain and discomfort of arthritis. While the pain of arthritis is a factor in poor sleep, it is not the only cause.Getting a Better SleepIn fact, research has shown pain killers are not necessarily the answer to disturbed sleep. For some reason, insomnia and arthritis often just co-exist. Medications given for arthritis may also be making sleep difficult. Cortisone, for example, can cause insomnia and, while some painkillers may make you drowsy, they may make you fall asleep during the day, which can then make it difficult to fall asleep at night.Whatever the cause, improving sleep is important. Research indicates that the sleep deprivation amplifies the pain of arthritis and a bad night’s sleep is linked to worse arthritis pain the next day. The deep stages of sleep are also when the body releases hormones to repair muscle damaged during the day.

Lifestyle modification and non-medication therapies have been shown to help.Some habits that can assist with sleep are:Avoid caffeine, in tea, coffee and soft drinks, especially after middayAvoid eating a large meal within three hours of bedtimeAvoid nicotine before bedtimeAvoid alcohol before bed, as it might make you sleepy but the quality of sleep is worseAvoid exercise three hours before bedtimeAvoid napping during the dayCreate a relaxing bedtime routine, going to bed and getting up at the same time every dayKeep the bedroom dark, cool and quietAvoid watching television, using your phone or tablet, or working in the bedroomTry taking a bath before bedIf you can’t fall asleep, after 20 minutes get up and go back to bed when you feel sleepyGet adequate light exposure during the dayIt may help to create a sleep diary, recording your sleep patterns and what factors have helped and hindered you getting to sleep and staying asleep. Using a fitness tracker with a sleep recording device may also help you to understand better the quality of the sleep you are getting.If medication is keeping you awake, you might also need to talk to your doctor about altering your medications or the time of day you take them.Therapies to Help Get a Better SleepThere are some specific therapies shown to help with sleep:Yoga – involves stretching, strengthening, balancing, breathing exercises and meditation. Yoga may help with sleep by reducing joint stiffness and promoting relaxation.Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) – involves training the mind to change from negative unhelpful thinking to more positive useful thought patterns. Examples include changing the bedtime routine and counteracting negative thoughts in the evening. CBT is taught by psychologists and there are also online courses where you can learn techniques.Relaxation techniques – relaxation exercises include deep breathing, controlled and timed breathing, mindfulness meditation, tai chi, and activities that focus the mind in the present. Relaxation can help calm the mind prior to bed. It can also help relax any stiff and aching muscles.Daily exercise – gentle daily exercise can help. It can make you feel more fatigued at the end of the day, which can help with sleepiness. 20 minutes every day is good and can be spaced in two 10-minute segments. Low-impact exercises, such as walking, cycling or water aerobics are good.Medication - if sleep is very difficult, there may be a role for medication. Doctors may prescribe painkillers, anti-inflammatory medications, sedatives, or certain antidepressants that can have sedative effects. The type of medication will likely depend on the precise reason you are having trouble sleeping and must also take into consideration other medications you might be on.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsArthritis SymptomsArthritis and Fatigue: Is My Arthritis Making Me Tired?BlogWhat Is the Difference Between Osteoporosis and Rheumatoid Arthritis?BlogThe Best and Worst Foods to Eat for People With Rheumatoid ArthritisBlogWhat Is Degenerative Arthritis?BlogGluten-Free Diet for Arthritis: 4 Foods That Can Help With InflammationArthritis SymptomsArthritis and Your Skin: How Does Arthritis Affect Your Skin?you may also likeArthritis CopingThe Gout Diet: 7 Foods to Eat With GoutArthritis Coping10 Exercises to Help Carpal Tunnel SymptomsArthritis CopingBeing a Young Person With Rheumatoid ArthritisArthritis Coping10 Ways to Relieve Arthritis Painconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

What was going on? How did you feel? Were there any major life changes going on? How was your stress?Now, think back to a recent time when you had a lot of stress. How were your arthritis symptoms? Did you notice any changes? Were they for the better or the worse?After you answered these questions, you probably began to uncover the relationship between stress and arthritis. Many people report the onset of their symptoms come immediately after a major life event or after an intensely stressful time. They also report that once the symptoms are established, they increase their levels of perceived stress. Things that would normally be easier to manage become major barriers or obstacles to overcome because of arthritis pain.The relationship between stress and arthritis is clear, and it is bidirectional. This means that stress can spark or worsen arthritis while arthritis can trigger or worsen stress. Experts in the field are constantly looking for ways to explain the link.Currently, they have two ideas regarding the biological explanation for the link, which each has to do with the body’s response to stress. The targets are called cytokines and cortisol. Cytokines are a category of proteins released by cells. Some cytokines are related to inflammation associated with arthritis. Cortisol is a hormone that is released during periods of stress that inhibits the body’s ability to repair cell damage.Stress/Arthritis SolutionsIn this case, the question remains: What can I do to improve my arthritis so that my stress is lower, and how do I lower my stress to improve my arthritis? The answer is a long one that is broken into two parts. Part one is to take care of your arthritis. Part two is to take care of your stress. Focusing on one or the other can result in you being overwhelmed and burned out, though. Because your time, efforts, and resources are limited, it is advantageous to seek out solutions that efficiently manage both steps simultaneously. Here’s how:The Big ThreeWith your physical health, there is nothing more important than the combination of sleep, diet, and exercise. When stress or arthritis are present, modifying one or all of these factors can lead to tremendously beneficial results. Having the right amount of sleep for you; an improved diet based on lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables; and increased, low-impact physical activity will make a positive difference in your mental health and physical health.You may think that increased physical activity will increase your arthritis pain, but reconsider this faulty notion. Consult your physician to find the recommended form of exercise for your level of pain. Swimming, walking, yoga or elliptical trainers could give you the profits of exercise without the pain. Overall, exercise is shown to reduce joint pain with consistent use. Studies also show exercise to be associated with the release of stress-reducing chemicals into the brain.Related Search Topics Back Arthritis Pain ReliefBack Pain Relief ArthritisOsteoarthritis Pain ReliefRheumatoid Arthritis Treatments You May Also Like10 Tips for Better Coping With ArthritisArthritis Coping10 Tips for Better Coping With Arthritis9 years ago| by Eric PattersonGetting any physical or mental health diagnosis puts high levels of stress on you.Eating well helps you to feel well both mentally and physically. For your physical health, be sure to evade known foods that result in inflammation or increase discomfort. Ask your doctor to list foods you should avoid while you maintain a food journal to track poor food choices specific to your body. When you eat for energy rather than enjoyment, your body and mind reward you with a heightened ability to manage daily stress.With sleep, the evidence is everywhere. Sleeping helps your body and your mind reset and recuperate after a long day. Be aware, though. More sleep is not necessarily better. Investigate your sleep patterns to determine if your trends need to be shortened or extended. Experiment with different lengths of sleep gradually to ease your body through the process.Relaxation TechniquesIf stress is a concern in your life, relaxation techniques are a viable solution. Techniques come in many variations with near-endless options for customization. For your stress and arthritis, there is a version perfect for you. An added layer of benefit is that most relaxation techniques work to strengthen the body as well as the mind.Begin with a simple deep breathing technique. Diaphragmatic breathing means that you are using your diaphragm to inhale in a deeper way that increases the volume of air in your lungs. Increased air available floods your blood much-needed oxygen to feed your organs. When oxygen is sufficient, your heart can slow, which calms your entire being. If deep breathing has been a struggle, begin with the exhale. Push out all of the air from your lungs, pause, and then suck in as much air as your can to fill low in your lungs. Leave your shoulders still, and push out your stomach.Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is another relaxation technique that yields a two-fold value. By tensing and relaxing your muscles, you can stretch and move your joints in a way that relieves pain. To complete PMR, tense muscles in a part of your body by squeezing your hands into fists or squinting you eyes and forehead. Target the sources of your physical stress. After holding and feeling the tension, relax the muscles and feel the tension melt away. Experiment with different methods of tension in different locations to explore all the PMR has to offer.Find AcceptanceEvery day, people have added stress and discomfort in their life due to lack of acceptance of their current state. Yes. You can manage arthritis symptoms, and you can reduce your stress, but there is little chance that either will be completely eradicated. Because of this, you need to find acceptance.Bringing acceptance into your life does not mean that you are giving up or ending your battle with arthritis or stress. It does mean that you understand the influence that these issues present to your life. Acceptance helps to change your expectations of yourself and your world to be more practical and realistic. Some days you are going to be in pain. Some days your stress will be high. Denying these facts only amplify the unwanted effects.ConclusionArthritis and stress are painful in a literal and figurative way. Do not expend your energies inefficiently by trying to improve each individual. Working on the tips above will simultaneously lessen your physical pain and mental anguish while improving your overall well-being. By changing your life, the only risk is feeling better. Start feeling better today.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsBlogThe Connection Between Arthritis, Anxiety and DepressionArthritis Symptoms8 Warning Signs of OsteoarthritisArthritis SymptomsWhat Are the 10 Most Common Types of Arthritis?Arthritis SymptomsSeropositive and Seronegative: The 2 Types of Rheumatoid ArthritisBlogFour Foods You Shouldn’t Eat If You Have ArthritisBlogWhat Are the Signs of Arthritis in the Back?you may also likeArthritis CopingHow Breathing Exercises Can HelpArthritis CopingThe Gout Diet: 7 Foods to Eat With GoutArthritis CopingHow Losing Excess Weight Can Help ArthritisArthritis CopingCould Penicillin Injections Help Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis?connect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

For some people, it hits early and follows a distinct pattern of pain, swelling and stiffness, but others struggle for years with misdiagnoses and ineffective treatments.In any case, RA is more than just a joint problem, and it warrants a different plan of attack than other types of arthritis. Don’t wait for your body to break down to call your doctor – if you notice any of these suspicious symptoms, consult with a rheumatologist to check for RA and to learn about the health complications of rheumatoid arthritis.1. FatigueFeeling sleepy is one thing, but an exhaustion that’s difficult to overcome is another issue altogether. Fatigue is one of the first signs that your autoimmune response is kicking into overdrive, and it can last for weeks or months before any other symptoms begin to pop up.You may also notice a feeling of general malaise, and that physical discomfort can turn into an emotional burden. When does fatigue demand a visit to the doctor?

You’ve likely heard of carpal tunnel before but may not realize why it develops and what can be done.Let’s take a look at the 10 common signs of carpal tunnel, when to see a doctor, how it’s treated, and how you can help prevent this condition.What Is Carpal Tunnel?Carpal tunnel syndrome is a medical condition that causes numbness, tingling and other symptoms in the hand and arm. This condition develops when a nerve is compressed in the carpal tunnel, which is a narrow passageway leading to your wrist (on the palm side). This nerve is called the median nerve.Some people seem to have a higher risk of carpal tunnel, possibly due to the anatomy of the wrist. When you perform repetitive tasks using one hand or wrist, this can put excess pressure on the median nerve. This creates pressure causing symptoms like tingling and numbness in the hand and arm. The pain can travel up the forearm, even to the shoulder and elsewhere.Causes of carpal tunnel include:Repetitive motions especially if your hands are lower than your wrist.Conditions like diabetes, obesity, hypothyroidism, obesity, and rheumatoid arthritisPregnancyIn fact, there is is no single cause. A combination of factors likely leads to developing this condition.Anything that squeezes or irritates the median nerve may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. A wrist fracture, for example, can narrow the carpal tunnel and irritate the nerve. The inflammation and swelling from rheumatoid arthritis can also contribute.One thing is certain, women are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. Researchers believe this is because the carpal tunnel area is smaller in women than it is in men. And some women have smaller carpal tunnels than others do.Working conditions are often to blame. Along with typing, working with vibrating tools - or doing a repetitive motion on an assembly line – can create the harmful pressure that irritates the median nerve or worsens nerve damage.Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel SyndromeLet’s take a close look at the signs and symptoms of this medical condition:1. Tingling or NumbnessThe first symptoms can be very subtle – a slight numbness or tingling in your fingertips or hands. Interestingly, the pinky finger very often is not affected. The tingling may feel very unusual, possibly like an electric shock.You might feel this tingling when you hold an object – your phone, the steering wheel, or a pen. You might even wake up at night feeling the tingling. Your first instinct might be to shake your hands to stop the tingling.2. WeaknessIf your hands have started feeling weak – and you have trouble holding objects – you might have carpal tunnel syndrome. Have you started dropping things? The hand numbness might cause this, or it’s because muscles in your thumb are affected. The median nerve controls the thumb.Most people don’t realize this condition doesn’t just cause tingling and pain. It can also make holding onto things a lot harder. You can even lose your ability to do everyday things like open a milk bottle or grip the steering wheel of your car.3. Nighttime SymptomsSome people feel their first symptoms at night when they bend wrists while asleep. This bending motion puts pressure on the median nerve, which can be very tingly or painful.Your first reaction might be to shake your wrists in an attempt to short-circuit the sensation. If this is happening frequently, talk to your doctor. At that point it’s probably carpal tunnel – and not some weird occurrence. Get treatment early before it gets worse.4. Feeling of Swollen FingersIf your fingers feel swollen – but they look fine – it might be carpal tunnel. This feeling can be very strange because it makes no sense. To look at your fingers, they don’t look any different from usual. Yet they feel larger, very swollen.You may think soaking your hands in hot water will help them feel better, but this won’t help. This feeling of swollen fingers is very typical in cases of advanced carpal tunnel syndrome.Related Search Topics Osteoarthritis Pain ReliefBack Pain Relief ArthritisRA and Fibromyalgia TreatmentsBack Arthritis Pain Relief You May Also LikeWhat Are the 10 Most Common Types of Arthritis?Arthritis SymptomsWhat Are the 10 Most Common Types of Arthritis?5 years ago| by Katrina HodginsIf you suspect arthritis is the source of your pain the first step is a diagnosis. Here are 10 of the most common types of arthritis to watch out for.5. Pain and Tingling Traveling Up the ForearmThe feeling of numbness, pain, and tingling can extend beyond your fingers and hands. Your forearm might get affected – as well as your shoulder. This radiating pain can be very uncomfortable, but it’s generally carpal tunnel – not something worse. Many people have reported this type of sensation.6. Electric ShocksA feeling of “electric shock” is often described among carpal tunnel symptoms. You might experience this feeling occasionally through your fingers. This can be disturbing as people with other conditions like multiple sclerosis also report similar sensations -- much like tingling and numbness.It’s important to find out what exactly is causing these symptoms, to make sure you know whether it’s carpal tunnel syndrome or another serious disease.7. Difficulty Holding Small ObjectsIf you can’t easily hold your toothbrush, use your keys, or handle a pen, you might have carpal tunnel syndrome. Very often, dexterity and flexibility with small objects is very limited. You can work with big objects the same as before, but they might fall while you’re carrying them.8. Making a Fist is DifficultIf you’ve ever slept on your hand in a strange position, you know that it’s hard to make a fist after you wake up. Or if you’ve been biking a long distance, your hands can feel nearly paralyzed, useless. You couldn’t make a fist if you tried. Your impulse is to “shake out” your fingers to loosen them.That’s the feeling when you have carpal tunnel syndrome. It’s very frustrating and embarrassing when you can’t make a fist – as it affects your ability to do everyday things like grip a milk carton or a package, or even hold onto the car’s steering wheel.9. Can’t Sleep Due to Wrist PainIf the wrist pain is so bad that you can’t sleep at night, carpal tunnel syndrome may be at work. You might have thought that carpal tunnel was just tingling and numbness, but as the condition worsens, there can be severe pain. Because the wrist is a sensitive area, you can have a difficult time sleeping – or focusing on your work during the day.10. Clumsy MovesEveryday activities can be difficult when you have carpal tunnel, including cooking, driving, even washing your face. That’s because fine motor skills have been affected. But there’s even more going on. You may not be able to tell where your hand is in relation to objects.This is a condition called proprioception, and it can be very embarrassing, making you feel clumsy. You might set a glass down just short of a table, so there’s a mess. It’s like your eyes and hands are playing tricks on you -- but it’s really just an odd symptom of carpal tunnel.Prevention of Carpal Tunnel SyndromeTo help prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, you can minimize stress on your hands and wrists. A few tips:Relax your grip whenever possible. If your job involves a keyboard or a cash register, hit the keys as softly as possible. If you write for lengthy periods, use a big pen with a soft grip adapter and free-flowing ink.Take frequent breaks. Stretch and bend your hands and wrists periodically. Do something different for a while, especially if you’re using equipment that vibrates.Protect your wrist. Don’t bend your wrist all the way up or down. Keep your wrist in a relaxed middle position. Your keyboard should be at elbow height or slightly lower.Improve your posture. If you sit incorrectly, your shoulders can roll forward. This shortens your neck and shoulder muscles and compresses the nerves in your neck. All this pressure will affect your wrists, fingers, and hands.Change your computer mouse. Don’t strain your wrist while working with your mouse; make sure it’s in a comfortable position.Keep your hands warm. If you work in a warm (vs. cold) environment, you’re less likely to develop hand pain and stiffness. Fingerless gloves will keep your hands and wrists warm.Carpal tunnel syndrome at work is a serious matter. In some settings, it may be necessary to redesign workstations to ensure that the worker's wrist is in a natural position during work. Supervisors should also make sure that jobs are rotated among workers whenever possible.When to See a Doctor for Carpal TunnelWhen you can’t sleep because of the pain in your hand, wrist or forearm, it is time to see a specialist. You need to find out the cause, whether it is carpal tunnel or another medical problem.If your symptoms occur occasionally, they might not be related to carpal tunnel. Most people have had a hand that “falls asleep”, for example. However, when it happens often, you should talk to your doctor.If you do have carpal tunnel syndrome and don't get treatment, the symptoms can get worse. In some cases, they may disappear for a while, then return.Bottom line is – with early diagnosis, the treatment is easier. With proper treatment, the tingling, numbness and other symptoms can resolve. You can regain your wrist and hand function.ResourcesVeryHealthy.com (10 Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel)WebMD (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome)NINDS (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome)Mayo Clinic (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsArthritis CopingHow Do Injections for Arthritis Work?BlogGluten-Free Diet for Arthritis: 4 Foods That Can Help With InflammationBlogCoping with Feelings of Anger and FrustrationBlogStiff, Painful Shoulder?

ArthritisLiving.todayMenuArthritis SymptomsArthritis CopingBlogSearchSearch Rheumatoid arthritis may affect any joint in your body. The most common body parts that are affected by rheumatoid arthritis are the hands and fingers. How Does Rheumatoid Arthritis Affect Your Hands?FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail5 years ago| by Katrina Hodgins Rheumatoid Arthritis in the HandsThere are 29 joints in each hand. When rheumatoid arthritis strikes in the hands, there are plenty of joints that can be affected.What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis?Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term, progressive, and disabling autoimmune disease—which means your body attacks itself by mistake. The results of these attacks are inflammation, swelling, and pain around the joints.When rheumatoid arthritis in the hands occurs, the joints affected include the large knuckles, middle knuckles, and joints in the wrist that connect the wrist bones to each other. The outermost joints of the fingers are affected by rheumatoid arthritis less frequently, but it can still happen.Causes of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the HandsJoints are susceptible to inflammation for people with rheumatoid arthritis. The nature of an autoimmune disease is to attack cells that the body thinks are dangerous.White blood cells, called leukocytes, are sent out to the hand joints. These white blood cells trigger inflammation in the synovial joints, which are the joints that allow for movement.Symptoms start when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the joints in the handsSymptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the HandsTenderness. The buildup of synovial fluid and thickening joint tissue causes the affected areas to feel sensitive.Symmetrical inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis usually affects both sides of the body equally. The pain and inflammation will mirror the left and right sides. If you have arthritis in the middle joints in one hand, you’re likely to experience the same in your other hand.Pain/Stiffness. You will feel an ache and decreased mobility in the wrists and knuckles. This symptom is worse in the mornings or after long periods of inactivity.Rheumatoid nodules. Hard, round bumps may gradually form under the skin in the affected joints of your fingers and wrists. These nodules are made of inflammatory tissue that builds up the longer you have rheumatoid arthritis. The bumps aren’t usually painful, but if you are concerned about them, you should see a doctor. Medications for rheumatoid arthritis may reduce the size of the nodules.Misalignment of joints. Over time, the destruction of joint tissue and bone erosion may cause deformations in the fingers and thumbs causing them to no longer align properly. With the advent of rheumatoid arthritis medications, there has been a reduction in the likelihood of permanent deformities.Skin flushing. Much like skin flushing you experience when you’ve been exercising or had one too many alcoholic beverages, the skin on your wrists and knuckles may feel warm and become red or purplish in color.Carpal tunnel syndrome. People with rheumatoid arthritis may have tingling and numbness in their hands and fingers. This may be the result of inflammation in the median nerve (also known as carpal tunnel).Fatigue and flu-like symptoms. Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease that has the ability to cause symptoms all over the body. These symptoms may include fever, fatigue, and nausea.Related Search Topics Treatment Rheumatoid ArthritisRA TreatmentsRA And Gout Foot PainRheumatoid Arthritis Treatments You May Also LikeArthritis and Your Skin: How Does Arthritis Affect Your Skin?Arthritis SymptomsArthritis and Your Skin: How Does Arthritis Affect Your Skin?6 years ago| by Lana BarhumThere are many kinds of arthritis and they don’t just affect the joints. Many of them also cause other symptoms, including skin problems.Treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis in the HandsThere are a variety of treatment methods for rheumatoid arthritis, ranging from non-medicinal to medicinal to surgical options. The best way to treat rheumatoid arthritis is with good medical management.Non-Medicinal Treatment Options for RA in the HandsOccupational therapy helps strengthen joints in the wrists and fingers. This type of therapy improves hand dexterity and decreases the risk of future joint deformity or misalignment.Occupational therapy helps educate on different ways to perform everyday tasks, which use a variety of tools and techniques, that will accommodate your rheumatoid arthritis and ease the impact on your joints. Occupational therapy may also include exercises that help improve hand function and relieve rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Strengthening and stretching exercises for the hand and wrists can improve grip strength and joint mobility.Splinting through the use of braces stabilizes hand joints to limit further deformity. There are several types of braces, some stabilize individual knuckles and others stabilize the wrist and hand. To ease stress on the joint, splinting is usually combined with injections.Only wear a splint as directed by your doctor; too much of a good thing, in this case, may result in wasting the muscles that support the joint which leads to additional issues. Splinting is prescribed less now because surgery is becoming a more common treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.Medications for RA in the HandsRheumatoid arthritis is usually treated with medication which includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These medications are prescribed to relieve pain and control arthritis as well as help control inflammation and prevent damage to the joints in the hands.Corticosteroid injections are also a common treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and can be done to each joint three to four times a year. These medications are similar to a hormone made naturally by the body. The medication is injected into the affected joints to relieve inflammation. Often injected with long-lasting anesthetic for pain relief. Injections can be repeated as needed for relief of rheumatoid arthritis but should be limited to reduce the risk of side effects.Surgical OptionsFinger and wrist joint surgery are on the rise in recent years. This is a treatment option for those who have lost hand function due to deformity or those who are in severe pain.Surgery is usually pursued after the patient has tried medication and other kinds of therapy. There are a few kinds of surgery available.With joint replacement surgery, the surgeon removes the damaged bone surfaces and replaces them with prostheses made of metal and plastic. For joints with extreme inflammation, the surgeon will go in and remove the damaged tissue from the joint. Surgery may only be a temporary fix to the problem.Talk to your doctor to see if surgery is right for you.Next StepsIf you have rheumatoid arthritis in the hands, make sure you are doing what you can to ease your symptoms through the treatment options suggested above. Your hands are your tools; make sure you’re not putting unnecessary strain on them.ResourcesArthritis-health (Hand Pain and Rheumatoid Arthritis)Arthritis-health (What is a Synovial Joint?)Medical News Today (What is Rheumatoid Arthritis?)Arthritis Foundation (Hand Therapies for Rheumatoid Arthritis)Rheumatoid Arthritis Support Network (RA Surgery: Can You Have Surgery to Remove Rheumatoid Arthritis?)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsArthritis Coping8 Fun and Therapeutic Activities for Arthritis SufferersBlogThe Best and Worst Foods to Eat for People With Rheumatoid ArthritisArthritis CopingDo Arthritis Gloves Help Relieve Pain?Arthritis CopingIs Botox Therapy an Effective Treatment Option for Arthritis?BlogRheumatoid Arthritis vs. OsteoarthritisArthritis Coping10 Therapies to Ease Arthritis Painyou may also likeArthritis SymptomsPsoriatic Arthritis: More Than Skin DeepArthritis Symptoms8 Warning Signs of Rheumatoid ArthritisArthritis Symptoms8 Symptoms of Psoriatic Arthritis to Be Aware OfArthritis SymptomsSeropositive and Seronegative: The 2 Types of Rheumatoid Arthritisconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

It’s a battle I struggle with on a daily basis and admittedly have not mastered since I was diagnosed with arthritis of the spine about two years ago.It can be very difficult to cope with the feelings of anger and frustration caused by the physical limitations and pain osteoarthritis can cause. How do you deal with the pure frustration of living with arthritis? What pulls you out of that dark hole of negative emotions when you're feeling down?My main source of frustration caused by arthritis comes from how long it took for me to get diagnosed with the disease, the rapid change in lifestyle osteoarthritis has caused in my life, and anytime I compare myself physically to what I used to be.One day after playing basketball in my junior year of college I slowly developed an excruciating pain in my back. Despite the tremendous pain I was in, the numerous specialists I saw could not diagnose me.I experienced about three years of doctors telling me that I was either malingering (basically faking it) or that they had no clue as to what was causing me so much pain. The problem was that my MRI did not show any abnormalities. During this time I was very resentful of the health care system, doctors, and the entire situation. I was finally diagnosed last year with facet-joint arthritis in three levels of my spine.Although being validated with a diagnosis helped to relieve some of my frustration with the condition, I still have my moments when I think about how much arthritis has affected my life and compare myself to what I was able to do before I developed it.Before I developed facet-joint arthritis in three levels of my spine at the age of 21, I was always active; I was lifting weights three or four times a week, running about two or three times a week, and playing basketball twice a week. I was maxing out on bench at around 240 lbs and was a proud member of my buddy's intramural basketball team.Then one day I felt a twinge in my back, and the rest is history. Now I have trouble lifting objects heavier than 20 pounds and haven’t run in about four years.I have accepted my reality and have learned to be active in other ways, but I still have my moments when I see someone playing basketball or hear my buddies talk about their latest physical accomplishment. However, I have developed a couple coping mechanisms and strategies to help me deal with some of the negative emotions that osteoarthritis can lead to.Related Search Topics Rheumatoid Arthritis TreatmentsTreatment Rheumatoid ArthritisBack Arthritis Pain ReliefRA Treatments You May Also LikeThis Is the Information You Need to Know When an Infection Triggers Reactive ArthritisBlogThis Is the Information You Need to Know When an Infection Triggers Reactive Arthritis5 years ago| by Shaina McQuilkieDid you know that you can develop reactive arthritis as the result of having an infection? Read on to learn more about reactive arthritis here.Maintain PerspectiveThe first thing I try to do is maintain perspective; yes osteoarthritis can be terrible, annoying, and disabling, but there are always people out there who manage with so much less. Similar to a kid who anxiously follows his favorite athlete, I follow various people who have had tremendous challenges in life and have found a way to overcome them, stay positive, and still be a productive member of society. For example; one of my biggest inspirations is Eric Legrand, a former college football player who became paralyzed after a tackle in 2010.Obviously his physical situation is worse than those of us who suffer from osteoarthritis, but he had his accident around the same time my back problems arose. When he first got injured, doctor's said he had a 0-5% chance of ever walking again. Although he has yet to accomplish his goal of walking, Legrand has reached his goals of breathing on his own, moving his neck, and learning to sit on his own.More importantly, he does it with a smile on his face and constant optimism. He is just one of numerous people who do tremendous things in life despite their physical limitations.Distract YourselfThe next strategy I try is to distract myself as much as humanly possible. When I say “distract,” I am not suggesting that you run away from the negative feelings that osteoarthritis may cause. But engaging in a productive activity can help one combat some of those feelings much better than doing nothing and focusing on the pain.For me, this might mean busying myself with homework, writing, going to the gym (despite my wife thinking it's a terrible idea), and even meditating. When I first developed osteoarthritis in my spine, a big challenge I faced was finding hobbies to replace those that involved exercising. Surprisingly, I developed a love for writing and reaching out to others with an adverse health situation like mine. Writing this article, I have the privilege of reaching out to people with my words and also releasing some of the emotions that I have felt in my battle with arthritis.Lastly, I try to remember that most things in life are temporary. This means enjoy the good times and be patient during the tough times because at some point they will probably end. Although the pain from osteoarthritis will probably always be there, that doesn't mean I won't have my good days where I can barely feel the pain.Although I don’t consider myself the most religious of people, my faith has helped me through the tough times and to embrace the mentality that everything is temporary. It is easy to get caught up in any moment, but keeping perspective over the long-term helps me a lot.It would be too easy to simply give in to frustrations and live an anger-filled life. And to be frank, there are times when I want to do that. Who wants to wake-up for a fight with their body every day? It's exhausting and frustrating.I can't predict the future or guarantee my success in this life, but all I can do is try. It would be nice to think that we will all get through life without ever suffering tremendous hardships, but that's simply naive. Life is all about working with the hand you’re dealt, rolling with the punches, and doing things to the best of your ability.These are just a couple of the positive coping strategies I have developed to help me deal with the challenges I face on a daily basis. I would love to hear what you’ve found works for you.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsArthritis CopingManaging Arthritis in the MorningArthritis Symptoms8 Symptoms of Psoriatic Arthritis to Be Aware OfArthritis Symptoms10 Carpal Tunnel Symptoms to Be Aware OfArthritis CopingHow Do Injections for Arthritis Work?Arthritis Coping10 Ways to Relieve Arthritis PainArthritis Coping5 Types of Yoga to Help Arthritis Symptomsyou may also likeBlogWhat Is the Difference Between Osteoporosis and Rheumatoid Arthritis?BlogThe Causes and Symptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis, and How to Treat ItBlogFour Foods You Shouldn’t Eat If You Have ArthritisBlogUnderstanding What Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Isconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

It affects one out of every 100 Canadians and up to 1% of the total global population. It is believed that certain foods can help and trigger symptoms, so we will take a look at the perfect rheumatoid arthritis diet.What Are the Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?Symptoms of RA can include pain, stiffness in the joints and swelling. Many patients start off with pain in just a few joints, only to find their condition worsens over time. Unfortunately, there is no cure for RA, but the inflammation involved can be treated with the right medications and therapies.What Causes Rheumatoid Arthritis?Even though we know that RA is caused by a malfunction in the immune system that causes the body to attack its own joints, the exact cause of this malfunction is still unknown. However, there are some known risk factors for RA. These include:Genetics. You are more likely to get rheumatoid arthritis at some point in your life if you have a family history of it.Sex. Women tend to get rheumatoid arthritis more than men.Age. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs more often in people who are middle aged or older.Environmental factors. Some researchers theorize that certain exposures like asbestos or silica may trigger rheumatoid arthritis.Lifestyle. Smoking, obesity and poor diet may trigger or worsen rheumatoid arthritis.How Does Diet Affect Rheumatoid Arthritis?Though diet is not a huge direct trigger of RA compared to genetics, age and other lifestyle factors, diet can still play a role in the management of RA.RA is an inflammatory condition. Inflammation is the process in which the body’s immune system flares up to fight an infection or something foreign in the body. This is why we get fevers when we are sick. Inflammation is typically a sign that the body is doing its job in keeping itself healthy. However, RA occurs when the immune system is fighting the body itself, not an infection.Because inflammation is a process triggered by the body, foods can greatly impact it. Some foods are anti-inflammatory, suppressing the body’s inflammation process, and other foods are inflammatory, boosting this response. These foods will impact the health of a person with RA.What Foods Are the Best for Rheumatoid Arthritis?The best foods for a person with RA are anti-inflammatory foods. Here are what some of these foods include.Fatty FishFatty fish, like salmon or tuna, contains many omega 3 fatty acids. These are a good kind of fat that many western diets are low in. Your body needs a healthy balance of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids (which are found in red meats) in order to fight off inflammation.Related Search Topics Rheumatoid Arthritis TreatmentsRA And Gout Foot PainBack Pain Relief ArthritisRA and Fibromyalgia Treatments You May Also LikeHow Does Arthritis Cause Rheumatoid Nodules?BlogHow Does Arthritis Cause Rheumatoid Nodules?4 years ago| by Miles MartinRheumatoid nodules are small lumps that form near joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis. Here's all you need to know about symptoms and treatment.Fruits and VegetablesFruits and vegetables are a huge part of any healthy diet but are especially helpful for people with RA because they are packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. It’s best to eat a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, and about seven to 10 servings per day.Whole GrainsWhole grains help lower levels of C-reactive protein, which is a marker of inflammation. They also contain more nutrients and fiber than refined grains, which is good news whether you have RA or not.Peas and BeansThese are a lean source of protein, which helps promote muscle growth. This is important because many people with RA lose muscle mass because of reduced movement, but other high protein foods like meat and dairy can be inflammatory.NutsNuts combine a lot of the benefits of other foods on this list. They have lots of omega 3 fatty acids (like fish), they have lots of fiber (like whole grains) and they have lots of protein (like peas and beans). They are the ultimate RA snack.Foods to Avoided With Rheumatoid ArthritisHere are some foods that need to be avoided with RA. These are all inflammatory foods.Fatty and Oily FoodsThough some types of fat are good for RA, most fats are considered inflammatory, such as vegetable oils, fats in meat and dairy, and trans fat, found in processed foods. Vegetable oil in particular contains a lot of omega 6 fatty acids, which can ruin a healthy balance of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and can worsen symptoms of inflammation.Red and Processed MeatsThese contain a lot of inflammatory fat and they also contain many unknown chemicals, which is a result of processing. Cured meats like salami and bacon are best to be avoided. Instead, opt for leaner white meats like chicken or turkey.Sugar and StarchSugary foods (like sweets and desserts) and white starchy foods (like French fries and potato chips) can be highly inflammatory because of their high carbohydrate content.GlutenMany patients with RA experience a worsening of their inflammatory symptoms after the consumption of gluten, even if they do not have a specific gluten allergy or celiac disease.Does Rheumatoid Arthritis Require a Special Diet?Certainly not! While there may be some anti-inflammatory benefits to keto, Mediterranean, vegan, or gluten free diets, these certainly are not necessary to live a good life with RA. Many of the foods that are anti-inflammatory are healthy choices whether you have RA or not. Likewise, many inflammatory foods are already foods that should be consumed in moderation (if at all). So, in many ways, a good diet for RA is not much different from a healthy diet for any other person.Some patients with RA can experience malnutrition because certain RA medications, like methotrexate, have been known to cause stomach ulcers, making it more difficult to eat. For this reason, vitamin supplements may be an additional element of RA treatment, but this should be discussed with your doctor.Rheumatoid arthritis is a difficult disease to live with, but by following some of the advice in this article, you can do a small part to take control of your health and live life to the fullest.ResourcesArthritis Society (What is rheumatoid arthritis?)Mayo Clinic (Rheumatoid arthritis) WebMD (What Is Inflammation?)Arthritis Foundation (Foods That Can Help RA Symptoms)Rheumatoid Arthritis Support Network (RA Inflammatory Foods: What Foods Cause Flare-Ups?)Rheumatoid Arthritis Support Network (RA Diet: What Foods to Eat if You Have Rheumatoid Arthritis?)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsArthritis SymptomsArthritis and Your Skin: How Does Arthritis Affect Your Skin?Arthritis CopingCould Penicillin Injections Help Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis?Arthritis Coping8 Ways to Combat Arthritis-Related StiffnessArthritis CopingSix Ways to Manage Psoriatic Arthritis PainArthritis CopingLiving With Lyme ArthritisArthritis Coping10 Exercises to Help Carpal Tunnel Symptomsyou may also likeBlogWhat Is Degenerative Arthritis?BlogWhat Is the Difference Between Osteoporosis and Rheumatoid Arthritis?Blog8 Common Misconceptions About ArthritisBlogGluten-Free Diet for Arthritis: 4 Foods That Can Help With Inflammationconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

After all, your liver is such a regenerative and resilient organ, it can continue to function just enough to keep you going even when there is serious damage and disease at play.Secondary liver cancer is more prevalent than primary liver cancer; the term refers to cancer that originates somewhere else in the body and moves to the liver (metastasizes), where it continues to grow. Once liver cancer symptoms begin to materialize, they normally indicate a later stage cancer, but there is a chance to catch the disease early – and hopefully slow or stop the progression – if you spot any of these suspicious signs.1. Weight LossOne common early symptom of liver cancer is unexplained weight loss, affecting up to 40% of cancer patients at the time of diagnosis. If you’ve been eating regularly but your level activity or level of stress hasn’t increased, the falling number on the scale could point to a serious underlying problem.Often, this initial weight loss is linked to changes in appetite or periodic nausea (two other early cancer symptoms), but the cancer could also be causing changes in your metabolism, leading your body to burn through its calories quickly. When weight loss comes with other changes or new discomforts, it’s time to see a doctor.NextRelated Search Topics Liver Cancer Survival RatesTypes of Breast Cancer ChemoNew Cancer Treatments LungKidney Cancer Medications You May Also Like7 Signs of Eye Cancer You Shouldn’t IgnoreCancer Symptoms7 Signs of Eye Cancer You Shouldn’t Ignore4 years ago| by Katrina HodginsEye cancer symptoms can often overlap with other eye conditions, so talk to your doctor if your eye health changes.

Benign vs. Malignant Tumors: Understanding the DifferenceFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail6 years ago| by Natalie Saunders Benign vs. Malignant TumorsA tumor is a solid or fluid-filled mass of tissue which can appear almost anywhere in the body. Tumors can be any shape or size, and may be benign or malignant.The Definition of Benign and MalignantPeople often talk about benign and malignant tumors, but what does this mean? The dictionary definition of benign is “not recurrent; favorable for recovery with appropriate treatment.”When talking about tumors, benign means not cancerous or directly threatening to life. It is the opposite of malignant, which is defined as ""tending to become progressively worse and to result in death; having the properties of anaplasia, invasiveness, and metastasis; said of tumors.""This means that cells in malignant tumors can change their structure and travel to other areas of the body. These are the type of tumors which cause cancer, and if left untreated, they may be fatal.Benign vs. Malignant Tumor CharacteristicsBenign TumorsBenign tumors can affect many different parts of the body including organs, glands, nerves, connective tissue and the skin. They will vary in size and shape depending on where they are and what is causing them.Benign tumors are often surrounded by a sac which is created by the immune system to keep them separated from the rest of the body. Benign tumors grow slowly, if at all, and cannot spread to other areas.These tumors are not harmful in themselves but may cause issues such as pain or discomfort if they press against a blood vessel or nerve. Sometimes a benign tumor forms in the endocrine system, on glands such as the pituitary gland or the thyroid. This can cause hormonal imbalances and further, potentially serious symptoms. These symptoms will depend on exactly which glands and hormones are affected.Malignant TumorsThe immune system is usually very effective at destroying cells which could become cancerous, but sometimes a few slip through the net. These cells can quickly grow into malignant tumors, putting your health at risk.Malignant tumors are cancerous and can spread to different areas of the body through the blood or lymphatic system. They grow and travel quickly, meaning that early detection is vital if they are to be stopped. These tumors are graded on a scale from 0–4 which is used to indicate their size and how much they have spread.Like benign tumors, malignant tumors can affect many different areas of the body. Some of the most common are the breasts, testicles, prostate gland, lungs, liver, and stomach.What Is the Difference Between Benign and Malignant Tumors?The main difference between these two types of tumor is that benign tumors are usually harmless, whereas malignant tumors cause cancer.Benign tumors also stay in one area, but malignant tumors can spread throughout the body, affecting different organs and tissues.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungNew Liver Cancer TreatmentsKidney Cancer MedicationsTreat Metastatic Breast Cancer You May Also LikeMetastatic Cancer: Why Cancer SpreadsCancer AwarenessMetastatic Cancer: Why Cancer Spreads8 years ago| by Krystina Ostermeyer RN, BSNCancer that is confined to a single organ or body system is scary. But why does cancer spread? Learn more about why cancer metastasizes.The treatment for benign and malignant tumors is also different. Benign tumors often require no treatment. However, if they are causing symptoms, they may be removed or reduced in size.Malignant tumors must be removed, even if they are not currently causing any symptoms. Early removal of malignant tumors is vital to reduce the risk of cancer cells spreading throughout the body.Are There any Similarities Between Benign and Malignant Tumors?There are many similarities between benign and malignant tumors. They can both affect almost any part of the body, and both can cause masses which may be seen or felt through the skin.Both benign and malignant tumors may cause various symptoms depending on where they are located within the body. Equally, both may be symptom-free in the early stages of development.There is no hard and fast rule for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors without a biopsy. This is a medical test where your physician will take a small sample of tissue from your tumor and check it for cancer cells. If these are found, the tumor is malignant and will need to be removed.In addition to benign and malignant tumors, there is a third type of tumor known as premalignant tumors. This type of tumor is not currently malignant but has the potential to become so in the future. Therefore these type of tumors need close monitoring to prevent them from becoming a health risk.What to Do If a Tumor Is FoundIf you find a new lump, bump or tumor anywhere on your body, it is important not to panic. However, you should get it checked by your physician as soon as possible.In the vast majority of cases, it will turn out to be something harmless, but in the unlikely event that your tumor is malignant, you will want to get it treated as early as you can. This will reduce the risk of the tumor spreading and increase your chances of making a full recovery.ResourcesThe Free Dictionary (Benign)The Free Dictionary (Malignant)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsLiving With CancerYour Diet and CancerCancer TreatmentsHere Are the Five Most Popular Cancer TreatmentsLiving With CancerHow Support Groups Can Help Cancer PatientsLiving With Cancer8 Movies About Cancer You Need to SeeLiving With CancerWhy Does Cancer Cause Weight Loss?Living With CancerFive Great Herbs for Cancer Patientsyou may also likeCancer AwarenessWhat Is Acute Myelogenous Leukemia?Cancer AwarenessAre Skin Tags a Sign of Skin Cancer?Cancer AwarenessDo These Everyday Ingredients Cause Cancer?Cancer Awareness8 Things Every Man Should Know About Prostate Cancerconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

These lumps are commonly detected with a mammography, physical exam, or a different detection technique.While mammography is superior to other detection methods, it is not a substitute for getting to know your breasts and conducting self-breast exams routinely.Self-Breast ExamTo detect a lump, you need to know how your breasts usually feel.The best way to know what your breasts feel like is to conduct a self-breast exam in the shower every month after your menstrual period or pick a date each month that you will perform a self-breast exam if you no longer have periods.Examine each breast and the surrounding tissues including those under your armpits. Your surrounding tissues contain lymph nodes which can become enlarged if breast cancer is present.Lumps in the BreastMany women have dense or naturally lumpy breasts and detecting a lump in a firm, or lumpy tissue can be challenging.While conducting your self-breast exam note any areas that feel different than they did the previous month. Most lumps in breasts that are cancerous are painless.They are often very tiny when detected. Expert diagnosis is needed to evaluate what lesions are. Cancerous lumps usually feel very different than noncancerous lumps or cysts. Cysts are usually tender and smooth. They may increase or decrease inside in size during the month.Cancerous tumors are often irregularly shaped, hard, painless, and immobile. Regardless of whether or not you believe a lump is simply a cyst, calcium deposit, harmless tumor, or cancer it is essential that you notify your healthcare provider immediately upon finding an irregularity.Your healthcare provider will conduct an exam and likely order a mammogram to diagnose the lesion.Other Signs of Breast CancerSome women experience bloody or any other drainage from the nipple when breast cancer is present. Other women notice that their breasts just look different to them.For example, one breast may hang differently than it used to. These changes are both signs of breast cancer and need further evaluation by your healthcare professional.There is a severe type of breast cancer which is fortunately rare. It is called inflammatory breast cancer. Breast tissues may be red, hot, and very painful. The breast may swell. The skin may pucker taking on the appearance of an orange peel.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungTypes of Breast Cancer ChemoNew Liver Cancer TreatmentsNew Cancer Pill You May Also Like7 Signs of Eye Cancer You Shouldn’t IgnoreCancer Symptoms7 Signs of Eye Cancer You Shouldn’t Ignore4 years ago| by Katrina HodginsEye cancer symptoms can often overlap with other eye conditions, so talk to your doctor if your eye health changes.

Lymph nodes in the chest area or armpit may enlarge. Sometimes women find a new lump in the non-affected breast. A lump may occur due to metastasis, but it may also be an entirely new, unrelated, non-metastatic lesion.Breast cancer can metastasize to any place in the body. Areas where it is most likely to spread to include the other breast, nearby tissues, the bones, liver, brain, and lungs. The signs and symptoms vary based upon the location of the metastasis.For example, liver metastasis may result in the eyes or the skin yellowing. Bruising may occur, and the urine may become dark. The abdomen may swell.If breast cancer spreads to the brain, thinking may be impaired; seizures may occur, personality changes or headaches may arise.Pain is most common sign of cancer which metastasizes to bones. Fractures may occur with minimal movement or force.Breast cancer which spreads to the lungs may result in fatigue, a cough, increased respiratory secretions, and difficulty breathing. The skin may take on a bluish cast, particularly around the mouth, nose, and on the fingers and toes.Diagnostic Tests for Evaluating Breast Cancer Signs and SymptomsProfessional examinations and mammograms are used to locate tumors before self-exam can feel them. The earlier breast cancer is detected, the better the outcomes and the easier the treatment.A diagnostic mammogram and professional examination are conducted if a lump or other irregularity is found. Often lumps are also evaluated with the aid of ultrasound.Other tools for assessing tumors breast cancer include blood tests, x-rays, and MRIs. Some women utilize thermography to help identify tumors.The use of thermography, while helpful, does not substitute for mammograms. Diagnostic testing is conducted if metastasis is suspected or present. These may include bone scans, x-rays, pet scans, and many others.BiopsiesMany types of biopsies are used to evaluate lumps. The simplest kind of biopsy is called fine needle aspiration. A surgeon or other healthcare expert inserts a large bore needle into a tumor and sucks up the contents.The tissue sample is sent to the lab to determine whether they are cancerous or of another origin. This procedure can be done right in a physician's office. A local anesthetic may or may not be administered before the procedure.Stereotactic biopsies can be quite painful. While using an advanced imaging technique called fluoroscopy, a healthcare provider carefully guides a fine wire into a tumor of the breast. A small amount of tissue is removed and sent for evaluation.Should surgery be needed, samples of the tumor are sent to a lab for further investigation.Every breast cancer is different. The lab evaluates the speed of growth, hormone status, and many other factors so that an effective treatment plan can be formulated.Early Diagnosis Equals Great Survival RatesAs a healthcare professional and as a woman who has had breast cancer, I cannot stress the importance of mammography, self and professional breast exams.Get to know your breasts.Most lumps and irregularities prove to be harmless, however, should cancer be present it is essential that you receive early treatment. If you have any symptoms that you suspect may indicate breast cancer, contact your health care provider without delay.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer PreventionCancer Risk Factors and What You Can DoCancer AwarenessCauses of Lung CancerCancer TreatmentsHow a Bone Marrow Transplant Helps Cancer PatientsCancer PreventionWhy Catching Cancer Early Is so ImportantCancer Awareness9 Things You Need to Know About Cervical CancerCancer AwarenessWhat You Need to Know About Stomach Canceryou may also likeCancer SymptomsSymptoms of Pancreatic CancerCancer SymptomsKnowing the Signs of Hodgkin’s LymphomaCancer SymptomsThe Silent Nine Signs of a Brain TumorCancer Symptoms10 Symptoms of Lung Cancer that Shouldn’t Be Ignoredconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

What Treatment Options Are Available for Breast Cancer?FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail5 years ago| by Shaina McQuilkie Breast Cancer TreatmentIn recent years, the mortality rate of women diagnosed with breast cancer has declined drastically due to improved health management programs aimed at alleviating and exterminating cancerous tumors in the mammary organs of women.In this article, we’ll touch upon what breast cancer is, and also discuss the three most commonly recommended treatment options for women diagnosed with breast cancer.What Is Breast Cancer?Breast cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the cells of the breast. A malignant tumor refers to a group of cancerous cells that can invade and destroy nearby tissues; additionally, it has the ability to spread to other areas of the body.Cells in the breast occasionally change and fail to grow or behave in a normal way. These changes can lead to either benign breast conditions, including cysts and atypical hyperplasia, or non-malignant tumors such as intraductal papillomas.Conversely, in some individuals the changes in the cells of the breast cause breast cancer. Usually, breast cancer begins in the cells that line the ducts; this type of cancer is known as ductal carcinoma. However, it can also start in the cells of the lobules; this type of cancer is known as lobular carcinoma.Both of these cancers can be in situ, meaning that the cancer remains where it started and has not invaded surrounding tissues, or invasive, meaning that the cancer has spread into surrounding tissues.Other less common types of breast cancer include inflammatory breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and Paget disease of the breast. Rare types of breast cancer include soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.How Is Breast Cancer Treated?The three most commonly recommended conventional treatment options for breast cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation.The type of treatment for each patient depends on various factors including the type of cancer, stage of disease, and patient preference. In some cases, a multidisciplinary approach to treatment may be utilized. Additionally, there are a variety of complementary and alternative options such as yoga, acupuncture, and meditation that may be helpful for some patients when used in conjunction with traditional treatment options.Below we’ll discuss the three most common treatment options in a little more detail so you can better understand each option.Breast Cancer SurgerySurgery is typically the first line of attack against breast cancer and involves removal of the tumor, its surrounding tissues, or the whole breast itself to remove cancerous cells.Breast cancer surgery may include removal of the entire breast, which is known as a mastectomy, or may be breast conserving, which is known as a partial mastectomy.Breast-conserving surgery or partial mastectomy involves the removal of a part of the breast depending on the site and size of the tumor. There are two types of this surgery:Lumpectomy – removal of the lump and a small amount of surrounding tissue.Quadrantectomy – removal of a quarter of the breast tissue.Mastectomy involves the removal of the entire breast. The types of mastectomy include:Total or simple mastectomy – removal of the entire breast and nipple.Nipple-sparing mastectomy – removal of the entire breast without the removal of the nipple to preserve it for reconstructive surgery. This procedure can only be done if the tumor is far from the nipple and if the cancer has not spread to the nipple.Skin-sparing mastectomy – removal of the entire breast without the removal of the skin of the breast.Modified radical mastectomy – removal of the breast and the lymph nodes of the axilla or armpit.Radical mastectomy – removal of the breast, lymph nodes, and muscles under the affected breast.During a mastectomy or partial mastectomy, the surgeon may also perform lymph node removal or sentinel lymph node dissection, if the biopsy has revealed that the cancerous cells have spread outside of the milk duct.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungBreast Cancer HelpLung Cancer ImmunotherapyTreat Advanced Breast Cancer You May Also LikeColon Cancer Treatment PlansCancer TreatmentsColon Cancer Treatment Plans4 years ago| by Katrina HodginsThe variety of colon cancer treatments can be overwhelming for some people. It is important to learn about all the options and see which is right for you.Radiation Therapy for Breast CancerRadiation therapy involves using high-energy rays to remove and destroy cancer cells. This type of treatment may be given through external beam radiation or brachytherapy.Radiation therapy is usually given to patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery to prevent recurrence of cancer cell growth. Those who have had a mastectomy may undergo radiation therapy as well if the lumps they had are more than 5 cm in size, or if cancer is present in the lymph nodes.External beam radiation is a procedure where a person is exposed to radiation using a machine focused on the affected area. Each treatment session usually lasts for several minutes and is performed five days a week for 5 to 6 weeks.Brachytherapy, also called internal radiation, is a procedure that involves introducing radiation inside the body through radioactive seeds. There are two types of brachytherapy:Interstitial involves placement of catheters with pellets in the area where the cancerous cells were removed and for several periods during the day.Intracavitary involves the placement of a device in place of the tissue that was removed and kept in place until the treatment is finished.Chemotherapy for Breast CancerChemotherapy involves using medications to kill cancer cells in the body. These medications may be given by mouth or via injection into the vein. In many cases, a combination of chemotherapy medications may be used at the same time to improve treatment outcomes.Chemotherapy may be recommended before or after surgery. Chemotherapy is given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy, while chemotherapy given after surgery is called adjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used to decrease the size of the tumor so that operation is less extensive. Adjuvant chemotherapy is used to kill cancer cells after surgery to prevent recurrence of the cancer.There are various side effects chemotherapy including mouth sores, nausea and vomiting, hair loss, changes in appetite, easy bruising, fatigue, and increased risk of infection.Research has shown that standard chemotherapy treatment lowers the risk of recurrence when administered in the early stages of the disease, while it helps to shrink or eliminate cancer in approximately 30 percent to 60 percent of individuals with advanced stages of breast cancer.ConclusionIf you’ve been diagnosed with breast cancer, you’ll want to thoroughly discuss all available breast cancer treatment options with your healthcare provider. Choosing the right treatment option, taking into account all of the risks and side effects of the treatment, is essential to optimize your chance of a full recovery and optimize your quality of life.It’s important to keep in mind that choosing the appropriate treatment option is a decision that is ultimately made by the patient and their loved ones, after taking into account recommendations from various healthcare practitioners.ResourcesCanadian Cancer Society (What is Breast Cancer?)Breastcancer.org (Treatment and Side Effects)National Cancer Institute (Breast Cancer Treatment)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer PreventionHow to Check for 4 Common CancersCancer AwarenessHow Cancer Cells Start, Grow and SpreadCancer AwarenessWhat Causes Bladder Cancer?Cancer Prevention10 of the Best Cancer-Fighting Foods to Add to Your DietCancer AwarenessEverything You Need to Know About Donating to CancerCancer Prevention10 Things You Can Do to Prevent Skin Canceryou may also likeCancer TreatmentsHow Stem Cell Transplants Are Used for Cancer PatientsCancer TreatmentsThe Latest in Cancer Treatment: Proton Beam TherapyCancer TreatmentsWhat are White Blood Cell Boosters?Cancer TreatmentsHow a Bone Marrow Transplant Helps Cancer Patientsconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Understanding How Cancerous Tumors FormFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail4 years ago| by Katrina Hodgins Important Information on Cancerous TumorsOver time, normal cells may become cancer cells, and these cancer cells may encourage the growth of a tumor. Tumors may be benign or malignant, and there are some important distinctions, especially when it comes to cancerous tumors.What Is a Cancerous Tumor?By biological design, normal cells die off after they grow old or become damaged and are replaced by new cells.Cancerous tumors begin when the old or damaged cells don’t die off, but new cells continue to form. Over time, cells can mutate, and these abnormal cells may not die off when they should, or they keep multiplying. This abundance of extra cells gradually forms lumps of tissue mass in the body, and these tumors vary in type and size.Cancerous tumors are malignant, which is another way of saying they can invade surrounding tissues.Causes of Cancerous TumorsCancerous tumors can start anywhere in the body. Their location usually suggests its shape and how the tumor will grow. But why do these tumors appear in the first place? The cause can be as simple as DNA.There are three main types of genes which contribute to cancer:Proto-oncogenes: these genes are involved in regular cell growth and division. If these genes become abnormal or hyperactive, they may become cancer-causing genes (oncogenes). Oncogenes let cells grow and continue to live when they should die off.Tumor-suppressor genes: these genes are also involved in cell growth and division. Specific abnormalities in these genes may cause cells to divide uncontrollably and may eventually become a tumor.DNA repair genes: it’s no surprise that the job of these genes is to fix damaged DNA. Mutations in these genes can cause additional mutations in the DNA they are supposed to repair. A combination of damaged DNA repair genes and improper DNA maintenance by these genes cause the cells to become cancerous.Many gene mutations you are not born with, but you acquire throughout life. External forces can also cause gene mutations such as smoking (including second-hand smoke), carcinogens, radiation (such as UV radiation), viruses, hormones, chronic inflammation, and obesity.SymptomsSymptoms will depend on the location of the tumor and whether the tumor has invaded nearby tissues that affect other body functions. Symptoms that may appear in tandem with a cancerous tumor are:A lump, or thickening of an area, that can be felt under the skinFatigueUnintended weight changesChanges in bowel or bladder functionDiscomfort or issues after eatingIssues breathingPersistent coughUnexplained joint or muscle painUnexplained fever or night sweatsUnexplained bleeding or bruisingBenign Versus Malignant TumorsTumors can be benign or malignant. When your doctor can diagnose which kind of tumor you have, they will be able to prescribe the proper treatment. There are a few significant differences between benign and malignant tumors.Benign TumorsCells in benign tumors are similar to normal cells, which means that these tumors may grow rather slowly, and they usually have a covering made up of normal cells and are contained within a fibrous connective tissue. These types of tumors typically have a smooth and regular shape.Benign tumors do not spread into healthy tissues, but they can grow to large sizes and cause the surrounding area to have to accommodate the growth. When benign tumors are removed, they seldom grow back, making tumor removal an effective treatment.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungNew Liver Cancer TreatmentsTreat Metastatic Breast CancerLiver Cancer Survival Rates You May Also LikeWhat Is the Cause of Multiple Myeloma?Cancer AwarenessWhat Is the Cause of Multiple Myeloma?6 years ago| by Eric PattersonMultiple myeloma is cancer that starts in the bone marrow's plasma cells and may be present for some time before symptoms emerge.Malignant TumorsCancerous tumors are the malignant type of tumor. Malignant tumors grow at a faster pace than benign tumors and cause damage to the surrounding tissues. Cancerous tumors have abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably to form the mass.This type of tumor may metastasize to other parts of the body. Cancer cells can break off the tumors and travel through the blood or lymph system to form secondary tumors in other areas.When malignant tumors are surgically removed, there is the possibility that they can grow back, so be aware if any lumps come back after removal.Tumor Grade SystemIf a tumor is suspected to be malignant, a doctor will attempt to remove all of it during a biopsy and examine the tissue to see if it’s benign or malignant.A grading system is used to classify a tumor based on how abnormal the tumor cells look under a microscope. Tumors are classified by the type of cancer, based on their appearance under a microscope and pattern of growth.The purpose of the classification is to indicate how quickly the tumor is expected to grow and spread. And it includes histologic and nuclear grade. There are five grades:GX: The grade cannot be assessed (undetermined grade)G1: Well defined cells (low grade where the cells appear close to normal)G2: Moderately differentiated cells (medium/intermediate grade)G3: Poorly differentiated cells (high grade where the cells do not look normal and spread quickly)G4: Undifferentiated (highest grade)Treatment for Cancerous TumorsDiagnosis and treatment are based on the type, size, stage, and location of the tumor. Some patients only use one treatment, but many patients will use a combination of treatments. Benign tumors often don’t need treatment but may require medical intervention to reduce the size of the tumor, sometimes through surgery.Cancerous tumors are usually treated with one of three methods (each with their own side effects):Chemotherapy: This treatment uses drugs to kill cancer cells. It is a recommended and effective treatment against cancer.Radiation Therapy: This cancer treatment uses high doses of radiation to kill the cancer cells and reduce the size of tumors. There are different types of radiation available.Surgery: The surgeon does a procedure to remove the cancer from the body.Catching a cancerous tumor early is the best line of defense. To give yourself the best chance of locating a cancerous tumor before it spreads, make sure you’re screening yourself for lumps. There are plenty of online resources to check yourself at home, or you can make an appointment with your doctor to give you an examination.By switching to a healthier lifestyle and avoiding carcinogens (and other external forces that cause tumors), we can give ourselves a better chance at preventing a cancerous tumor from appearing.ResourcesNational Cancer Institute (What is Cancer?)National Cancer Institute (Tumor Grade)Healio (What is a Tumor?)Canadian Cancer Society (Types of Tumors)Research UK (How Cancers Grow)Mayo Clinic (Cancer)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer PreventionHow to Check for 4 Common CancersLiving With CancerGoing Through Cancer While PregnantLiving With Cancer8 Movies About Cancer You Need to SeeLiving With CancerDepression, Anxiety, Stress and CancerCancer Symptoms9 Warning Signs of Liver CancerCancer TreatmentsMedical Marijuana: Can It Really Help Cancer Patients?you may also likeCancer AwarenessLung Cancer and Smoking: The Best Reason to Quit SmokingCancer AwarenessEverything You Need to Know About Donating to CancerCancer AwarenessColon Cancer: Symptoms, Screening, and Prevention TipsCancer AwarenessWhat to Know About Cachexia and Cancerconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Sufferers have trouble getting to sleep with arthritis, as well as staying asleep, waking early, and the sleep tends to be lighter, restless and unrefreshing.As people get older, they tend to spend more of their sleep time in the lighter phases of sleep, which means they are more likely to be disrupted by the pain and discomfort of arthritis. While the pain of arthritis is a factor in poor sleep, it is not the only cause.Getting a Better SleepIn fact, research has shown pain killers are not necessarily the answer to disturbed sleep. For some reason, insomnia and arthritis often just co-exist. Medications given for arthritis may also be making sleep difficult. Cortisone, for example, can cause insomnia and, while some painkillers may make you drowsy, they may make you fall asleep during the day, which can then make it difficult to fall asleep at night.Whatever the cause, improving sleep is important. Research indicates that the sleep deprivation amplifies the pain of arthritis and a bad night’s sleep is linked to worse arthritis pain the next day. The deep stages of sleep are also when the body releases hormones to repair muscle damaged during the day. Disrupted sleep can also affects other aspects of life, causing fatigue, thinking problems, difficulty concentrating, poor memory, headaches and disturbed mood.Related Search Topics Back Arthritis Pain ReliefBack Pain Relief ArthritisRA TreatmentsRA and Fibromyalgia Treatments You May Also Like6 Types of Medication That Treat Rheumatoid ArthritisArthritis Coping6 Types of Medication That Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis5 years ago| by Jeanie DavisLooking for ways to manage stiffness, pain, and inflammation? Here are six rheumatoid arthritis medications that may help control common RA symptoms.While sleep medications can assist, they do have side effects. They also do not address the underlying causes for the sleep disturbance, which can lead to reliance on the sleep medication. Lifestyle modification and non-medication therapies have been shown to help.Some habits that can assist with sleep are:Avoid caffeine, in tea, coffee and soft drinks, especially after middayAvoid eating a large meal within three hours of bedtimeAvoid nicotine before bedtimeAvoid alcohol before bed, as it might make you sleepy but the quality of sleep is worseAvoid exercise three hours before bedtimeAvoid napping during the dayCreate a relaxing bedtime routine, going to bed and getting up at the same time every dayKeep the bedroom dark, cool and quietAvoid watching television, using your phone or tablet, or working in the bedroomTry taking a bath before bedIf you can’t fall asleep, after 20 minutes get up and go back to bed when you feel sleepyGet adequate light exposure during the dayIt may help to create a sleep diary, recording your sleep patterns and what factors have helped and hindered you getting to sleep and staying asleep. Using a fitness tracker with a sleep recording device may also help you to understand better the quality of the sleep you are getting.If medication is keeping you awake, you might also need to talk to your doctor about altering your medications or the time of day you take them.Therapies to Help Get a Better SleepThere are some specific therapies shown to help with sleep:Yoga – involves stretching, strengthening, balancing, breathing exercises and meditation. Yoga may help with sleep by reducing joint stiffness and promoting relaxation.Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) – involves training the mind to change from negative unhelpful thinking to more positive useful thought patterns. Examples include changing the bedtime routine and counteracting negative thoughts in the evening. CBT is taught by psychologists and there are also online courses where you can learn techniques.Relaxation techniques – relaxation exercises include deep breathing, controlled and timed breathing, mindfulness meditation, tai chi, and activities that focus the mind in the present. Relaxation can help calm the mind prior to bed. It can also help relax any stiff and aching muscles.Daily exercise – gentle daily exercise can help. It can make you feel more fatigued at the end of the day, which can help with sleepiness. 20 minutes every day is good and can be spaced in two 10-minute segments. Low-impact exercises, such as walking, cycling or water aerobics are good.Medication - if sleep is very difficult, there may be a role for medication. Doctors may prescribe painkillers, anti-inflammatory medications, sedatives, or certain antidepressants that can have sedative effects. The type of medication will likely depend on the precise reason you are having trouble sleeping and must also take into consideration other medications you might be on.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsArthritis SymptomsArthritis and Fatigue: Is My Arthritis Making Me Tired?Arthritis SymptomsCan Arthritis Cause Chest Pain?BlogCoping with Feelings of Anger and FrustrationBlogHow Eating Better Can Help Arthritis SymptomsBlogWhat Are the Signs of Arthritis in the Back?BlogUnderstanding What Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Isyou may also likeArthritis CopingManaging Arthritis in the MorningArthritis Coping10 Great Foods For Arthritis ManagementArthritis CopingSix Ways to Manage Psoriatic Arthritis PainArthritis CopingThe Relationship Between Stress and Arthritisconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

What was going on? How did you feel? Were there any major life changes going on? How was your stress?Now, think back to a recent time when you had a lot of stress. How were your arthritis symptoms? Did you notice any changes? Were they for the better or the worse?After you answered these questions, you probably began to uncover the relationship between stress and arthritis. Many people report the onset of their symptoms come immediately after a major life event or after an intensely stressful time. They also report that once the symptoms are established, they increase their levels of perceived stress. Things that would normally be easier to manage become major barriers or obstacles to overcome because of arthritis pain.The relationship between stress and arthritis is clear, and it is bidirectional. This means that stress can spark or worsen arthritis while arthritis can trigger or worsen stress. Experts in the field are constantly looking for ways to explain the link.Currently, they have two ideas regarding the biological explanation for the link, which each has to do with the body’s response to stress. The targets are called cytokines and cortisol. Cytokines are a category of proteins released by cells. Some cytokines are related to inflammation associated with arthritis. Cortisol is a hormone that is released during periods of stress that inhibits the body’s ability to repair cell damage.Stress/Arthritis SolutionsIn this case, the question remains: What can I do to improve my arthritis so that my stress is lower, and how do I lower my stress to improve my arthritis? The answer is a long one that is broken into two parts. Part one is to take care of your arthritis. Part two is to take care of your stress. Focusing on one or the other can result in you being overwhelmed and burned out, though. Because your time, efforts, and resources are limited, it is advantageous to seek out solutions that efficiently manage both steps simultaneously. Here’s how:The Big ThreeWith your physical health, there is nothing more important than the combination of sleep, diet, and exercise. When stress or arthritis are present, modifying one or all of these factors can lead to tremendously beneficial results. Having the right amount of sleep for you; an improved diet based on lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables; and increased, low-impact physical activity will make a positive difference in your mental health and physical health.You may think that increased physical activity will increase your arthritis pain, but reconsider this faulty notion. Consult your physician to find the recommended form of exercise for your level of pain. Swimming, walking, yoga or elliptical trainers could give you the profits of exercise without the pain. Overall, exercise is shown to reduce joint pain with consistent use. Studies also show exercise to be associated with the release of stress-reducing chemicals into the brain.Related Search Topics Back Arthritis Pain ReliefBack Pain Relief ArthritisRA TreatmentsFibromyalgia and RA Treatments You May Also LikeHow Losing Excess Weight Can Help ArthritisArthritis CopingHow Losing Excess Weight Can Help Arthritis9 years ago| by Meredith CrowhurstWhile losing excess weight can be challenging with arthritis, it can be achieved with a proper diet and safe, gentle exercise to improve symptoms.Eating well helps you to feel well both mentally and physically. For your physical health, be sure to evade known foods that result in inflammation or increase discomfort. Ask your doctor to list foods you should avoid while you maintain a food journal to track poor food choices specific to your body. When you eat for energy rather than enjoyment, your body and mind reward you with a heightened ability to manage daily stress.With sleep, the evidence is everywhere. Sleeping helps your body and your mind reset and recuperate after a long day. Be aware, though. More sleep is not necessarily better. Investigate your sleep patterns to determine if your trends need to be shortened or extended. Experiment with different lengths of sleep gradually to ease your body through the process.Relaxation TechniquesIf stress is a concern in your life, relaxation techniques are a viable solution. Techniques come in many variations with near-endless options for customization. For your stress and arthritis, there is a version perfect for you. An added layer of benefit is that most relaxation techniques work to strengthen the body as well as the mind.Begin with a simple deep breathing technique. Diaphragmatic breathing means that you are using your diaphragm to inhale in a deeper way that increases the volume of air in your lungs. Increased air available floods your blood much-needed oxygen to feed your organs. When oxygen is sufficient, your heart can slow, which calms your entire being. If deep breathing has been a struggle, begin with the exhale. Push out all of the air from your lungs, pause, and then suck in as much air as your can to fill low in your lungs. Leave your shoulders still, and push out your stomach.Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is another relaxation technique that yields a two-fold value. By tensing and relaxing your muscles, you can stretch and move your joints in a way that relieves pain. To complete PMR, tense muscles in a part of your body by squeezing your hands into fists or squinting you eyes and forehead. Target the sources of your physical stress. After holding and feeling the tension, relax the muscles and feel the tension melt away. Experiment with different methods of tension in different locations to explore all the PMR has to offer.Find AcceptanceEvery day, people have added stress and discomfort in their life due to lack of acceptance of their current state. Yes. You can manage arthritis symptoms, and you can reduce your stress, but there is little chance that either will be completely eradicated. Because of this, you need to find acceptance.Bringing acceptance into your life does not mean that you are giving up or ending your battle with arthritis or stress. It does mean that you understand the influence that these issues present to your life. Acceptance helps to change your expectations of yourself and your world to be more practical and realistic. Some days you are going to be in pain. Some days your stress will be high. Denying these facts only amplify the unwanted effects.ConclusionArthritis and stress are painful in a literal and figurative way. Do not expend your energies inefficiently by trying to improve each individual. Working on the tips above will simultaneously lessen your physical pain and mental anguish while improving your overall well-being. By changing your life, the only risk is feeling better. Start feeling better today.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsBlog8 Arthritis-Friendly Exercises to Help Ease Joint Pain and StiffnessBlogThis Is the Information You Need to Know When an Infection Triggers Reactive ArthritisBlogThe Causes and Symptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis, and How to Treat ItBlogHow Eating Better Can Help Arthritis SymptomsArthritis Symptoms10 Carpal Tunnel Symptoms to Be Aware OfArthritis SymptomsUnderstanding Rheumatoid Arthritis-Related Painyou may also likeArthritis CopingHow Breathing Exercises Can HelpArthritis CopingClinical Trials for Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid and Psoriatic ArthritisArthritis CopingCan Essential Oils Helps Relieve Arthritis Symptoms?Arthritis CopingBeing a Young Person With Rheumatoid Arthritisconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

For some people, it hits early and follows a distinct pattern of pain, swelling and stiffness, but others struggle for years with misdiagnoses and ineffective treatments.In any case, RA is more than just a joint problem, and it warrants a different plan of attack than other types of arthritis. Don’t wait for your body to break down to call your doctor – if you notice any of these suspicious symptoms, consult with a rheumatologist to check for RA and to learn about the health complications of rheumatoid arthritis.1. FatigueFeeling sleepy is one thing, but an exhaustion that’s difficult to overcome is another issue altogether. Fatigue is one of the first signs that your autoimmune response is kicking into overdrive, and it can last for weeks or months before any other symptoms begin to pop up.You may also notice a feeling of general malaise, and that physical discomfort can turn into an emotional burden. When does fatigue demand a visit to the doctor? If it goes on for more than two weeks, despite your efforts to get more rest and reduce stress, it’s time investigate further.NextRelated Search Topics Pain Medication RATreatment RA FingersStages Of Rheumatoid ArthritisSevere RA Treatment Options You May Also LikeWhat Are the Common Triggers for Arthritis Flare-Ups?Arthritis SymptomsWhat Are the Common Triggers for Arthritis Flare-Ups?4 years ago| by Miles MartinDuring an arthritis flare-up, symptoms become severe.

You’ve likely heard of carpal tunnel before but may not realize why it develops and what can be done.Let’s take a look at the 10 common signs of carpal tunnel, when to see a doctor, how it’s treated, and how you can help prevent this condition.What Is Carpal Tunnel?Carpal tunnel syndrome is a medical condition that causes numbness, tingling and other symptoms in the hand and arm. This condition develops when a nerve is compressed in the carpal tunnel, which is a narrow passageway leading to your wrist (on the palm side). This nerve is called the median nerve.Some people seem to have a higher risk of carpal tunnel, possibly due to the anatomy of the wrist. When you perform repetitive tasks using one hand or wrist, this can put excess pressure on the median nerve. This creates pressure causing symptoms like tingling and numbness in the hand and arm. The pain can travel up the forearm, even to the shoulder and elsewhere.Causes of carpal tunnel include:Repetitive motions especially if your hands are lower than your wrist.Conditions like diabetes, obesity, hypothyroidism, obesity, and rheumatoid arthritisPregnancyIn fact, there is is no single cause. A combination of factors likely leads to developing this condition.Anything that squeezes or irritates the median nerve may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. A wrist fracture, for example, can narrow the carpal tunnel and irritate the nerve. The inflammation and swelling from rheumatoid arthritis can also contribute.One thing is certain, women are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. Researchers believe this is because the carpal tunnel area is smaller in women than it is in men. And some women have smaller carpal tunnels than others do.Working conditions are often to blame. Along with typing, working with vibrating tools - or doing a repetitive motion on an assembly line – can create the harmful pressure that irritates the median nerve or worsens nerve damage.Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel SyndromeLet’s take a close look at the signs and symptoms of this medical condition:1. Tingling or NumbnessThe first symptoms can be very subtle – a slight numbness or tingling in your fingertips or hands. Interestingly, the pinky finger very often is not affected. The tingling may feel very unusual, possibly like an electric shock.You might feel this tingling when you hold an object – your phone, the steering wheel, or a pen. You might even wake up at night feeling the tingling. Your first instinct might be to shake your hands to stop the tingling.2. WeaknessIf your hands have started feeling weak – and you have trouble holding objects – you might have carpal tunnel syndrome. Have you started dropping things? The hand numbness might cause this, or it’s because muscles in your thumb are affected. The median nerve controls the thumb.Most people don’t realize this condition doesn’t just cause tingling and pain. It can also make holding onto things a lot harder. You can even lose your ability to do everyday things like open a milk bottle or grip the steering wheel of your car.3. Nighttime SymptomsSome people feel their first symptoms at night when they bend wrists while asleep. This bending motion puts pressure on the median nerve, which can be very tingly or painful.Your first reaction might be to shake your wrists in an attempt to short-circuit the sensation. If this is happening frequently, talk to your doctor. At that point it’s probably carpal tunnel – and not some weird occurrence. Get treatment early before it gets worse.4. Feeling of Swollen FingersIf your fingers feel swollen – but they look fine – it might be carpal tunnel. This feeling can be very strange because it makes no sense. To look at your fingers, they don’t look any different from usual. Yet they feel larger, very swollen.You may think soaking your hands in hot water will help them feel better, but this won’t help. This feeling of swollen fingers is very typical in cases of advanced carpal tunnel syndrome.Related Search Topics Osteoarthritis Pain ReliefBack Pain Relief ArthritisRA and Fibromyalgia TreatmentsBack Arthritis Pain Relief You May Also LikeWhat Are the Common Triggers for Arthritis Flare-Ups?Arthritis SymptomsWhat Are the Common Triggers for Arthritis Flare-Ups?4 years ago| by Miles MartinDuring an arthritis flare-up, symptoms become severe. But what causes arthritis flare-ups? Here are the common triggers and how to avoid them.5. Pain and Tingling Traveling Up the ForearmThe feeling of numbness, pain, and tingling can extend beyond your fingers and hands. Your forearm might get affected – as well as your shoulder. This radiating pain can be very uncomfortable, but it’s generally carpal tunnel – not something worse. Many people have reported this type of sensation.6. Electric ShocksA feeling of “electric shock” is often described among carpal tunnel symptoms. You might experience this feeling occasionally through your fingers. This can be disturbing as people with other conditions like multiple sclerosis also report similar sensations -- much like tingling and numbness.It’s important to find out what exactly is causing these symptoms, to make sure you know whether it’s carpal tunnel syndrome or another serious disease.7. Difficulty Holding Small ObjectsIf you can’t easily hold your toothbrush, use your keys, or handle a pen, you might have carpal tunnel syndrome. Very often, dexterity and flexibility with small objects is very limited. You can work with big objects the same as before, but they might fall while you’re carrying them.8. Making a Fist is DifficultIf you’ve ever slept on your hand in a strange position, you know that it’s hard to make a fist after you wake up. Or if you’ve been biking a long distance, your hands can feel nearly paralyzed, useless. You couldn’t make a fist if you tried. Your impulse is to “shake out” your fingers to loosen them.That’s the feeling when you have carpal tunnel syndrome. It’s very frustrating and embarrassing when you can’t make a fist – as it affects your ability to do everyday things like grip a milk carton or a package, or even hold onto the car’s steering wheel.9. Can’t Sleep Due to Wrist PainIf the wrist pain is so bad that you can’t sleep at night, carpal tunnel syndrome may be at work. You might have thought that carpal tunnel was just tingling and numbness, but as the condition worsens, there can be severe pain. Because the wrist is a sensitive area, you can have a difficult time sleeping – or focusing on your work during the day.10. Clumsy MovesEveryday activities can be difficult when you have carpal tunnel, including cooking, driving, even washing your face. That’s because fine motor skills have been affected. But there’s even more going on. You may not be able to tell where your hand is in relation to objects.This is a condition called proprioception, and it can be very embarrassing, making you feel clumsy. You might set a glass down just short of a table, so there’s a mess. It’s like your eyes and hands are playing tricks on you -- but it’s really just an odd symptom of carpal tunnel.Prevention of Carpal Tunnel SyndromeTo help prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, you can minimize stress on your hands and wrists. A few tips:Relax your grip whenever possible. If your job involves a keyboard or a cash register, hit the keys as softly as possible. If you write for lengthy periods, use a big pen with a soft grip adapter and free-flowing ink.Take frequent breaks. Stretch and bend your hands and wrists periodically. Do something different for a while, especially if you’re using equipment that vibrates.Protect your wrist. Don’t bend your wrist all the way up or down. Keep your wrist in a relaxed middle position. Your keyboard should be at elbow height or slightly lower.Improve your posture. If you sit incorrectly, your shoulders can roll forward. This shortens your neck and shoulder muscles and compresses the nerves in your neck. All this pressure will affect your wrists, fingers, and hands.Change your computer mouse. Don’t strain your wrist while working with your mouse; make sure it’s in a comfortable position.Keep your hands warm. If you work in a warm (vs. cold) environment, you’re less likely to develop hand pain and stiffness. Fingerless gloves will keep your hands and wrists warm.Carpal tunnel syndrome at work is a serious matter. In some settings, it may be necessary to redesign workstations to ensure that the worker's wrist is in a natural position during work. Supervisors should also make sure that jobs are rotated among workers whenever possible.When to See a Doctor for Carpal TunnelWhen you can’t sleep because of the pain in your hand, wrist or forearm, it is time to see a specialist. You need to find out the cause, whether it is carpal tunnel or another medical problem.If your symptoms occur occasionally, they might not be related to carpal tunnel. Most people have had a hand that “falls asleep”, for example. However, when it happens often, you should talk to your doctor.If you do have carpal tunnel syndrome and don't get treatment, the symptoms can get worse. In some cases, they may disappear for a while, then return.Bottom line is – with early diagnosis, the treatment is easier. With proper treatment, the tingling, numbness and other symptoms can resolve. You can regain your wrist and hand function.ResourcesVeryHealthy.com (10 Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel)WebMD (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome)NINDS (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome)Mayo Clinic (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsBlogSpinal Arthritis: When Arthritis Affects the SpineBlogRheumatoid Arthritis and PregnancyBlogRheumatoid Arthritis vs. OsteoarthritisBlogWhat Are the Signs of Arthritis in the Back?BlogThe Connection Between Arthritis, Anxiety and DepressionBlog8 Arthritis-Friendly Exercises to Help Ease Joint Pain and Stiffnessyou may also likeArthritis SymptomsThe Connection Between Arthritis and GeneticsArthritis SymptomsUnderstanding Rheumatoid Arthritis-Related PainArthritis SymptomsArthritis and Your Skin: How Does Arthritis Affect Your Skin?Arthritis SymptomsUnderstanding the Top 10 Symptoms of Psoriatic Arthritisconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

ArthritisLiving.todayMenuArthritis SymptomsArthritis CopingBlogSearchSearch Rheumatoid arthritis may affect any joint in your body. The most common body parts that are affected by rheumatoid arthritis are the hands and fingers. How Does Rheumatoid Arthritis Affect Your Hands?FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail5 years ago| by Katrina Hodgins Rheumatoid Arthritis in the HandsThere are 29 joints in each hand. When rheumatoid arthritis strikes in the hands, there are plenty of joints that can be affected.What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis?Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term, progressive, and disabling autoimmune disease—which means your body attacks itself by mistake. The results of these attacks are inflammation, swelling, and pain around the joints.When rheumatoid arthritis in the hands occurs, the joints affected include the large knuckles, middle knuckles, and joints in the wrist that connect the wrist bones to each other. The outermost joints of the fingers are affected by rheumatoid arthritis less frequently, but it can still happen.Causes of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the HandsJoints are susceptible to inflammation for people with rheumatoid arthritis. The nature of an autoimmune disease is to attack cells that the body thinks are dangerous.White blood cells, called leukocytes, are sent out to the hand joints. These white blood cells trigger inflammation in the synovial joints, which are the joints that allow for movement.Symptoms start when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the joints in the handsSymptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the HandsTenderness. The buildup of synovial fluid and thickening joint tissue causes the affected areas to feel sensitive.Symmetrical inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis usually affects both sides of the body equally. The pain and inflammation will mirror the left and right sides. If you have arthritis in the middle joints in one hand, you’re likely to experience the same in your other hand.Pain/Stiffness. You will feel an ache and decreased mobility in the wrists and knuckles. This symptom is worse in the mornings or after long periods of inactivity.Rheumatoid nodules. Hard, round bumps may gradually form under the skin in the affected joints of your fingers and wrists. These nodules are made of inflammatory tissue that builds up the longer you have rheumatoid arthritis. The bumps aren’t usually painful, but if you are concerned about them, you should see a doctor. Medications for rheumatoid arthritis may reduce the size of the nodules.Misalignment of joints. Over time, the destruction of joint tissue and bone erosion may cause deformations in the fingers and thumbs causing them to no longer align properly. With the advent of rheumatoid arthritis medications, there has been a reduction in the likelihood of permanent deformities.Skin flushing. Much like skin flushing you experience when you’ve been exercising or had one too many alcoholic beverages, the skin on your wrists and knuckles may feel warm and become red or purplish in color.Carpal tunnel syndrome. People with rheumatoid arthritis may have tingling and numbness in their hands and fingers. This may be the result of inflammation in the median nerve (also known as carpal tunnel).Fatigue and flu-like symptoms. Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease that has the ability to cause symptoms all over the body. These symptoms may include fever, fatigue, and nausea.Related Search Topics RA And Gout Foot PainTreatment Rheumatoid ArthritisFibromyalgia and RA TreatmentsRA and Fibromyalgia Treatments You May Also LikeArthritis and Your Skin: How Does Arthritis Affect Your Skin?Arthritis SymptomsArthritis and Your Skin: How Does Arthritis Affect Your Skin?6 years ago| by Lana BarhumThere are many kinds of arthritis and they don’t just affect the joints. Many of them also cause other symptoms, including skin problems.Treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis in the HandsThere are a variety of treatment methods for rheumatoid arthritis, ranging from non-medicinal to medicinal to surgical options. The best way to treat rheumatoid arthritis is with good medical management.Non-Medicinal Treatment Options for RA in the HandsOccupational therapy helps strengthen joints in the wrists and fingers. This type of therapy improves hand dexterity and decreases the risk of future joint deformity or misalignment.Occupational therapy helps educate on different ways to perform everyday tasks, which use a variety of tools and techniques, that will accommodate your rheumatoid arthritis and ease the impact on your joints. Occupational therapy may also include exercises that help improve hand function and relieve rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Strengthening and stretching exercises for the hand and wrists can improve grip strength and joint mobility.Splinting through the use of braces stabilizes hand joints to limit further deformity. There are several types of braces, some stabilize individual knuckles and others stabilize the wrist and hand. To ease stress on the joint, splinting is usually combined with injections.Only wear a splint as directed by your doctor; too much of a good thing, in this case, may result in wasting the muscles that support the joint which leads to additional issues. Splinting is prescribed less now because surgery is becoming a more common treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.Medications for RA in the HandsRheumatoid arthritis is usually treated with medication which includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These medications are prescribed to relieve pain and control arthritis as well as help control inflammation and prevent damage to the joints in the hands.Corticosteroid injections are also a common treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and can be done to each joint three to four times a year. These medications are similar to a hormone made naturally by the body. The medication is injected into the affected joints to relieve inflammation. Often injected with long-lasting anesthetic for pain relief. Injections can be repeated as needed for relief of rheumatoid arthritis but should be limited to reduce the risk of side effects.Surgical OptionsFinger and wrist joint surgery are on the rise in recent years. This is a treatment option for those who have lost hand function due to deformity or those who are in severe pain.Surgery is usually pursued after the patient has tried medication and other kinds of therapy. There are a few kinds of surgery available.With joint replacement surgery, the surgeon removes the damaged bone surfaces and replaces them with prostheses made of metal and plastic. For joints with extreme inflammation, the surgeon will go in and remove the damaged tissue from the joint. Surgery may only be a temporary fix to the problem.Talk to your doctor to see if surgery is right for you.Next StepsIf you have rheumatoid arthritis in the hands, make sure you are doing what you can to ease your symptoms through the treatment options suggested above. Your hands are your tools; make sure you’re not putting unnecessary strain on them.ResourcesArthritis-health (Hand Pain and Rheumatoid Arthritis)Arthritis-health (What is a Synovial Joint?)Medical News Today (What is Rheumatoid Arthritis?)Arthritis Foundation (Hand Therapies for Rheumatoid Arthritis)Rheumatoid Arthritis Support Network (RA Surgery: Can You Have Surgery to Remove Rheumatoid Arthritis?)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsBlogCoping with Feelings of Anger and FrustrationArthritis CopingThe Relationship Between Stress and ArthritisBlogThis Is the Information You Need to Know When an Infection Triggers Reactive ArthritisArthritis CopingThe Gout Diet: 7 Foods to Eat With GoutArthritis CopingOver-the-Counter Options for Treating Arthritis PainBlogRheumatoid Arthritis vs. Osteoarthritisyou may also likeArthritis SymptomsArthritis and Fatigue: Is My Arthritis Making Me Tired?Arthritis Symptoms10 Carpal Tunnel Symptoms to Be Aware OfArthritis SymptomsThe Connection Between Arthritis and GeneticsArthritis SymptomsUnderstanding Rheumatoid Arthritis-Related Painconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

It’s a battle I struggle with on a daily basis and admittedly have not mastered since I was diagnosed with arthritis of the spine about two years ago.It can be very difficult to cope with the feelings of anger and frustration caused by the physical limitations and pain osteoarthritis can cause. How do you deal with the pure frustration of living with arthritis? What pulls you out of that dark hole of negative emotions when you're feeling down?My main source of frustration caused by arthritis comes from how long it took for me to get diagnosed with the disease, the rapid change in lifestyle osteoarthritis has caused in my life, and anytime I compare myself physically to what I used to be.One day after playing basketball in my junior year of college I slowly developed an excruciating pain in my back. Despite the tremendous pain I was in, the numerous specialists I saw could not diagnose me.I experienced about three years of doctors telling me that I was either malingering (basically faking it) or that they had no clue as to what was causing me so much pain. The problem was that my MRI did not show any abnormalities. During this time I was very resentful of the health care system, doctors, and the entire situation. I was finally diagnosed last year with facet-joint arthritis in three levels of my spine.Although being validated with a diagnosis helped to relieve some of my frustration with the condition, I still have my moments when I think about how much arthritis has affected my life and compare myself to what I was able to do before I developed it.Before I developed facet-joint arthritis in three levels of my spine at the age of 21, I was always active; I was lifting weights three or four times a week, running about two or three times a week, and playing basketball twice a week. I was maxing out on bench at around 240 lbs and was a proud member of my buddy's intramural basketball team.Then one day I felt a twinge in my back, and the rest is history. Now I have trouble lifting objects heavier than 20 pounds and haven’t run in about four years.I have accepted my reality and have learned to be active in other ways, but I still have my moments when I see someone playing basketball or hear my buddies talk about their latest physical accomplishment. However, I have developed a couple coping mechanisms and strategies to help me deal with some of the negative emotions that osteoarthritis can lead to.Related Search Topics Rheumatoid Arthritis TreatmentsFibromyalgia and RA TreatmentsRA TreatmentsOsteoarthritis Pain Relief You May Also LikeGluten-Free Diet for Arthritis: 4 Foods That Can Help With InflammationBlogGluten-Free Diet for Arthritis: 4 Foods That Can Help With Inflammation4 years ago| by Miles MartinA gluten-free diet for arthritis can be beneficial because it can help reduce inflammation. Here are the common gluten-free foods to consume.Maintain PerspectiveThe first thing I try to do is maintain perspective; yes osteoarthritis can be terrible, annoying, and disabling, but there are always people out there who manage with so much less. Similar to a kid who anxiously follows his favorite athlete, I follow various people who have had tremendous challenges in life and have found a way to overcome them, stay positive, and still be a productive member of society. For example; one of my biggest inspirations is Eric Legrand, a former college football player who became paralyzed after a tackle in 2010.Obviously his physical situation is worse than those of us who suffer from osteoarthritis, but he had his accident around the same time my back problems arose. When he first got injured, doctor's said he had a 0-5% chance of ever walking again. Although he has yet to accomplish his goal of walking, Legrand has reached his goals of breathing on his own, moving his neck, and learning to sit on his own.More importantly, he does it with a smile on his face and constant optimism. He is just one of numerous people who do tremendous things in life despite their physical limitations.Distract YourselfThe next strategy I try is to distract myself as much as humanly possible. When I say “distract,” I am not suggesting that you run away from the negative feelings that osteoarthritis may cause. But engaging in a productive activity can help one combat some of those feelings much better than doing nothing and focusing on the pain.For me, this might mean busying myself with homework, writing, going to the gym (despite my wife thinking it's a terrible idea), and even meditating. When I first developed osteoarthritis in my spine, a big challenge I faced was finding hobbies to replace those that involved exercising. Surprisingly, I developed a love for writing and reaching out to others with an adverse health situation like mine. Writing this article, I have the privilege of reaching out to people with my words and also releasing some of the emotions that I have felt in my battle with arthritis.Lastly, I try to remember that most things in life are temporary. This means enjoy the good times and be patient during the tough times because at some point they will probably end. Although the pain from osteoarthritis will probably always be there, that doesn't mean I won't have my good days where I can barely feel the pain.Although I don’t consider myself the most religious of people, my faith has helped me through the tough times and to embrace the mentality that everything is temporary. It is easy to get caught up in any moment, but keeping perspective over the long-term helps me a lot.It would be too easy to simply give in to frustrations and live an anger-filled life. And to be frank, there are times when I want to do that. Who wants to wake-up for a fight with their body every day? It's exhausting and frustrating.I can't predict the future or guarantee my success in this life, but all I can do is try. It would be nice to think that we will all get through life without ever suffering tremendous hardships, but that's simply naive.

It affects one out of every 100 Canadians and up to 1% of the total global population. It is believed that certain foods can help and trigger symptoms, so we will take a look at the perfect rheumatoid arthritis diet.What Are the Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?Symptoms of RA can include pain, stiffness in the joints and swelling. Many patients start off with pain in just a few joints, only to find their condition worsens over time. Unfortunately, there is no cure for RA, but the inflammation involved can be treated with the right medications and therapies.What Causes Rheumatoid Arthritis?Even though we know that RA is caused by a malfunction in the immune system that causes the body to attack its own joints, the exact cause of this malfunction is still unknown. However, there are some known risk factors for RA. These include:Genetics. You are more likely to get rheumatoid arthritis at some point in your life if you have a family history of it.Sex. Women tend to get rheumatoid arthritis more than men.Age. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs more often in people who are middle aged or older.Environmental factors. Some researchers theorize that certain exposures like asbestos or silica may trigger rheumatoid arthritis.Lifestyle. Smoking, obesity and poor diet may trigger or worsen rheumatoid arthritis.How Does Diet Affect Rheumatoid Arthritis?Though diet is not a huge direct trigger of RA compared to genetics, age and other lifestyle factors, diet can still play a role in the management of RA.RA is an inflammatory condition. Inflammation is the process in which the body’s immune system flares up to fight an infection or something foreign in the body. This is why we get fevers when we are sick. Inflammation is typically a sign that the body is doing its job in keeping itself healthy. However, RA occurs when the immune system is fighting the body itself, not an infection.Because inflammation is a process triggered by the body, foods can greatly impact it. Some foods are anti-inflammatory, suppressing the body’s inflammation process, and other foods are inflammatory, boosting this response. These foods will impact the health of a person with RA.What Foods Are the Best for Rheumatoid Arthritis?The best foods for a person with RA are anti-inflammatory foods. Here are what some of these foods include.Fatty FishFatty fish, like salmon or tuna, contains many omega 3 fatty acids. These are a good kind of fat that many western diets are low in. Your body needs a healthy balance of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids (which are found in red meats) in order to fight off inflammation.Related Search Topics Treatment Rheumatoid ArthritisFibromyalgia and RA TreatmentsRheumatoid Arthritis TreatmentsOsteoarthritis Pain Relief You May Also LikeHow Does Arthritis Cause Rheumatoid Nodules?BlogHow Does Arthritis Cause Rheumatoid Nodules?4 years ago| by Miles MartinRheumatoid nodules are small lumps that form near joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis. Here's all you need to know about symptoms and treatment.Fruits and VegetablesFruits and vegetables are a huge part of any healthy diet but are especially helpful for people with RA because they are packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. It’s best to eat a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, and about seven to 10 servings per day.Whole GrainsWhole grains help lower levels of C-reactive protein, which is a marker of inflammation. They also contain more nutrients and fiber than refined grains, which is good news whether you have RA or not.Peas and BeansThese are a lean source of protein, which helps promote muscle growth. This is important because many people with RA lose muscle mass because of reduced movement, but other high protein foods like meat and dairy can be inflammatory.NutsNuts combine a lot of the benefits of other foods on this list. They have lots of omega 3 fatty acids (like fish), they have lots of fiber (like whole grains) and they have lots of protein (like peas and beans). They are the ultimate RA snack.Foods to Avoided With Rheumatoid ArthritisHere are some foods that need to be avoided with RA. These are all inflammatory foods.Fatty and Oily FoodsThough some types of fat are good for RA, most fats are considered inflammatory, such as vegetable oils, fats in meat and dairy, and trans fat, found in processed foods. Vegetable oil in particular contains a lot of omega 6 fatty acids, which can ruin a healthy balance of omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and can worsen symptoms of inflammation.Red and Processed MeatsThese contain a lot of inflammatory fat and they also contain many unknown chemicals, which is a result of processing. Cured meats like salami and bacon are best to be avoided. Instead, opt for leaner white meats like chicken or turkey.Sugar and StarchSugary foods (like sweets and desserts) and white starchy foods (like French fries and potato chips) can be highly inflammatory because of their high carbohydrate content.GlutenMany patients with RA experience a worsening of their inflammatory symptoms after the consumption of gluten, even if they do not have a specific gluten allergy or celiac disease.Does Rheumatoid Arthritis Require a Special Diet?Certainly not! While there may be some anti-inflammatory benefits to keto, Mediterranean, vegan, or gluten free diets, these certainly are not necessary to live a good life with RA. Many of the foods that are anti-inflammatory are healthy choices whether you have RA or not. Likewise, many inflammatory foods are already foods that should be consumed in moderation (if at all). So, in many ways, a good diet for RA is not much different from a healthy diet for any other person.Some patients with RA can experience malnutrition because certain RA medications, like methotrexate, have been known to cause stomach ulcers, making it more difficult to eat. For this reason, vitamin supplements may be an additional element of RA treatment, but this should be discussed with your doctor.Rheumatoid arthritis is a difficult disease to live with, but by following some of the advice in this article, you can do a small part to take control of your health and live life to the fullest.ResourcesArthritis Society (What is rheumatoid arthritis?)Mayo Clinic (Rheumatoid arthritis) WebMD (What Is Inflammation?)Arthritis Foundation (Foods That Can Help RA Symptoms)Rheumatoid Arthritis Support Network (RA Inflammatory Foods: What Foods Cause Flare-Ups?)Rheumatoid Arthritis Support Network (RA Diet: What Foods to Eat if You Have Rheumatoid Arthritis?)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsArthritis Symptoms10 Carpal Tunnel Symptoms to Be Aware OfArthritis CopingSix Ways to Manage Psoriatic Arthritis PainArthritis CopingCan Essential Oils Helps Relieve Arthritis Symptoms?Arthritis Symptoms8 Warning Signs of Rheumatoid ArthritisArthritis CopingLiving With Lyme ArthritisArthritis SymptomsWhat Are the Common Triggers for Arthritis Flare-Ups?you may also likeBlogHow Eating Better Can Help Arthritis SymptomsBlogWhat Is Degenerative Arthritis?BlogSpinal Arthritis: When Arthritis Affects the SpineBlogCould Botox Injections Help Osteoarthritis?connect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsArthritisLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

After all, your liver is such a regenerative and resilient organ, it can continue to function just enough to keep you going even when there is serious damage and disease at play.Secondary liver cancer is more prevalent than primary liver cancer; the term refers to cancer that originates somewhere else in the body and moves to the liver (metastasizes), where it continues to grow. Once liver cancer symptoms begin to materialize, they normally indicate a later stage cancer, but there is a chance to catch the disease early – and hopefully slow or stop the progression – if you spot any of these suspicious signs.1. Weight LossOne common early symptom of liver cancer is unexplained weight loss, affecting up to 40% of cancer patients at the time of diagnosis. If you’ve been eating regularly but your level activity or level of stress hasn’t increased, the falling number on the scale could point to a serious underlying problem.Often, this initial weight loss is linked to changes in appetite or periodic nausea (two other early cancer symptoms), but the cancer could also be causing changes in your metabolism, leading your body to burn through its calories quickly. When weight loss comes with other changes or new discomforts, it’s time to see a doctor.NextRelated Search Topics Liver Cancer Survival RatesTypes of Breast Cancer ChemoKidney Cancer MedicationsLung Cancer Treatment Drugs You May Also LikeKnowing the Signs of Hodgkin’s LymphomaCancer SymptomsKnowing the Signs of Hodgkin’s Lymphoma4 years ago| by Katrina HodginsCommon symptoms of Hodgkin's lymphoma are swollen lymph nodes and weight loss.

Benign vs. Malignant Tumors: Understanding the DifferenceFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail6 years ago| by Natalie Saunders Benign vs. Malignant TumorsA tumor is a solid or fluid-filled mass of tissue which can appear almost anywhere in the body. Tumors can be any shape or size, and may be benign or malignant.The Definition of Benign and MalignantPeople often talk about benign and malignant tumors, but what does this mean? The dictionary definition of benign is “not recurrent; favorable for recovery with appropriate treatment.”When talking about tumors, benign means not cancerous or directly threatening to life. It is the opposite of malignant, which is defined as ""tending to become progressively worse and to result in death; having the properties of anaplasia, invasiveness, and metastasis; said of tumors.""This means that cells in malignant tumors can change their structure and travel to other areas of the body. These are the type of tumors which cause cancer, and if left untreated, they may be fatal.Benign vs. Malignant Tumor CharacteristicsBenign TumorsBenign tumors can affect many different parts of the body including organs, glands, nerves, connective tissue and the skin. They will vary in size and shape depending on where they are and what is causing them.Benign tumors are often surrounded by a sac which is created by the immune system to keep them separated from the rest of the body. Benign tumors grow slowly, if at all, and cannot spread to other areas.These tumors are not harmful in themselves but may cause issues such as pain or discomfort if they press against a blood vessel or nerve. Sometimes a benign tumor forms in the endocrine system, on glands such as the pituitary gland or the thyroid. This can cause hormonal imbalances and further, potentially serious symptoms. These symptoms will depend on exactly which glands and hormones are affected.Malignant TumorsThe immune system is usually very effective at destroying cells which could become cancerous, but sometimes a few slip through the net. These cells can quickly grow into malignant tumors, putting your health at risk.Malignant tumors are cancerous and can spread to different areas of the body through the blood or lymphatic system. They grow and travel quickly, meaning that early detection is vital if they are to be stopped. These tumors are graded on a scale from 0–4 which is used to indicate their size and how much they have spread.Like benign tumors, malignant tumors can affect many different areas of the body. Some of the most common are the breasts, testicles, prostate gland, lungs, liver, and stomach.What Is the Difference Between Benign and Malignant Tumors?The main difference between these two types of tumor is that benign tumors are usually harmless, whereas malignant tumors cause cancer.Benign tumors also stay in one area, but malignant tumors can spread throughout the body, affecting different organs and tissues.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungNew Liver Cancer TreatmentsLung Cancer Treatments New Cancer Pill You May Also LikeEverything You Need to Know About Throat CancerCancer AwarenessEverything You Need to Know About Throat Cancer5 years ago| by Natalie SaundersThroat cancer is a general term which can be used to describe any of the various types of cancer that affect the head, neck, or throat.The treatment for benign and malignant tumors is also different. Benign tumors often require no treatment. However, if they are causing symptoms, they may be removed or reduced in size.Malignant tumors must be removed, even if they are not currently causing any symptoms. Early removal of malignant tumors is vital to reduce the risk of cancer cells spreading throughout the body.Are There any Similarities Between Benign and Malignant Tumors?There are many similarities between benign and malignant tumors. They can both affect almost any part of the body, and both can cause masses which may be seen or felt through the skin.Both benign and malignant tumors may cause various symptoms depending on where they are located within the body. Equally, both may be symptom-free in the early stages of development.There is no hard and fast rule for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors without a biopsy. This is a medical test where your physician will take a small sample of tissue from your tumor and check it for cancer cells. If these are found, the tumor is malignant and will need to be removed.In addition to benign and malignant tumors, there is a third type of tumor known as premalignant tumors. This type of tumor is not currently malignant but has the potential to become so in the future. Therefore these type of tumors need close monitoring to prevent them from becoming a health risk.What to Do If a Tumor Is FoundIf you find a new lump, bump or tumor anywhere on your body, it is important not to panic. However, you should get it checked by your physician as soon as possible.In the vast majority of cases, it will turn out to be something harmless, but in the unlikely event that your tumor is malignant, you will want to get it treated as early as you can. This will reduce the risk of the tumor spreading and increase your chances of making a full recovery.ResourcesThe Free Dictionary (Benign)The Free Dictionary (Malignant)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsLiving With CancerWhy Does Cancer Cause Weight Loss?Cancer SymptomsEight Signs of Leukemia You Should Not IgnoreCancer TreatmentsHow Is Immunotherapy Different from Chemotherapy?Cancer PreventionHow to Prevent Cervical CancerCancer Symptoms10 Symptoms of Lung Cancer that Shouldn’t Be IgnoredCancer TreatmentsWhat Treatment Options Are Available for Breast Cancer?you may also likeCancer AwarenessDoes Talcum Powder Causes Ovarian Cancer?Cancer AwarenessMetastatic Cancer: Why Cancer SpreadsCancer AwarenessWhat You Should Know About Cancer in ChildrenCancer Awareness8 Things Every Man Should Know About Prostate Cancerconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

These lumps are commonly detected with a mammography, physical exam, or a different detection technique.While mammography is superior to other detection methods, it is not a substitute for getting to know your breasts and conducting self-breast exams routinely.Self-Breast ExamTo detect a lump, you need to know how your breasts usually feel.The best way to know what your breasts feel like is to conduct a self-breast exam in the shower every month after your menstrual period or pick a date each month that you will perform a self-breast exam if you no longer have periods.Examine each breast and the surrounding tissues including those under your armpits. Your surrounding tissues contain lymph nodes which can become enlarged if breast cancer is present.Lumps in the BreastMany women have dense or naturally lumpy breasts and detecting a lump in a firm, or lumpy tissue can be challenging.While conducting your self-breast exam note any areas that feel different than they did the previous month. Most lumps in breasts that are cancerous are painless.They are often very tiny when detected. Expert diagnosis is needed to evaluate what lesions are. Cancerous lumps usually feel very different than noncancerous lumps or cysts. Cysts are usually tender and smooth. They may increase or decrease inside in size during the month.Cancerous tumors are often irregularly shaped, hard, painless, and immobile. Regardless of whether or not you believe a lump is simply a cyst, calcium deposit, harmless tumor, or cancer it is essential that you notify your healthcare provider immediately upon finding an irregularity.Your healthcare provider will conduct an exam and likely order a mammogram to diagnose the lesion.Other Signs of Breast CancerSome women experience bloody or any other drainage from the nipple when breast cancer is present. Other women notice that their breasts just look different to them.For example, one breast may hang differently than it used to. These changes are both signs of breast cancer and need further evaluation by your healthcare professional.There is a severe type of breast cancer which is fortunately rare. It is called inflammatory breast cancer. Breast tissues may be red, hot, and very painful. The breast may swell. The skin may pucker taking on the appearance of an orange peel.Related Search Topics Cancer Immunotherapy TreatmentLiver Cancer Survival RatesLung Cancer Treatment Drugs Treat Advanced Breast Cancer You May Also LikeKnowing the Signs of Hodgkin’s LymphomaCancer SymptomsKnowing the Signs of Hodgkin’s Lymphoma4 years ago| by Katrina HodginsCommon symptoms of Hodgkin's lymphoma are swollen lymph nodes and weight loss. Here's how to know if you're at risk and when to talk to your doctor.Signs of Advanced Breast CancerThe signs of advanced breast cancer depend upon many factors including prior history and location of metastasis.Locally metastasized breast cancer may cause swelling of the arm on the affected side. Lymph nodes in the chest area or armpit may enlarge. Sometimes women find a new lump in the non-affected breast. A lump may occur due to metastasis, but it may also be an entirely new, unrelated, non-metastatic lesion.Breast cancer can metastasize to any place in the body. Areas where it is most likely to spread to include the other breast, nearby tissues, the bones, liver, brain, and lungs. The signs and symptoms vary based upon the location of the metastasis.For example, liver metastasis may result in the eyes or the skin yellowing. Bruising may occur, and the urine may become dark. The abdomen may swell.If breast cancer spreads to the brain, thinking may be impaired; seizures may occur, personality changes or headaches may arise.Pain is most common sign of cancer which metastasizes to bones. Fractures may occur with minimal movement or force.Breast cancer which spreads to the lungs may result in fatigue, a cough, increased respiratory secretions, and difficulty breathing. The skin may take on a bluish cast, particularly around the mouth, nose, and on the fingers and toes.Diagnostic Tests for Evaluating Breast Cancer Signs and SymptomsProfessional examinations and mammograms are used to locate tumors before self-exam can feel them. The earlier breast cancer is detected, the better the outcomes and the easier the treatment.A diagnostic mammogram and professional examination are conducted if a lump or other irregularity is found. Often lumps are also evaluated with the aid of ultrasound.Other tools for assessing tumors breast cancer include blood tests, x-rays, and MRIs. Some women utilize thermography to help identify tumors.The use of thermography, while helpful, does not substitute for mammograms. Diagnostic testing is conducted if metastasis is suspected or present. These may include bone scans, x-rays, pet scans, and many others.BiopsiesMany types of biopsies are used to evaluate lumps. The simplest kind of biopsy is called fine needle aspiration. A surgeon or other healthcare expert inserts a large bore needle into a tumor and sucks up the contents.The tissue sample is sent to the lab to determine whether they are cancerous or of another origin. This procedure can be done right in a physician's office. A local anesthetic may or may not be administered before the procedure.Stereotactic biopsies can be quite painful. While using an advanced imaging technique called fluoroscopy, a healthcare provider carefully guides a fine wire into a tumor of the breast. A small amount of tissue is removed and sent for evaluation.Should surgery be needed, samples of the tumor are sent to a lab for further investigation.Every breast cancer is different. The lab evaluates the speed of growth, hormone status, and many other factors so that an effective treatment plan can be formulated.Early Diagnosis Equals Great Survival RatesAs a healthcare professional and as a woman who has had breast cancer, I cannot stress the importance of mammography, self and professional breast exams.Get to know your breasts.Most lumps and irregularities prove to be harmless, however, should cancer be present it is essential that you receive early treatment. If you have any symptoms that you suspect may indicate breast cancer, contact your health care provider without delay.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer AwarenessWhat Are the Different Types of Skin Cancer?Cancer AwarenessDoes Talcum Powder Causes Ovarian Cancer?Cancer Awareness10 Things You Need to Know About Breast CancerCancer Awareness10 Most Common Types of CancerLiving With Cancer10 Cancer Terms You Should KnowCancer TreatmentsColon Cancer Treatment Plansyou may also likeCancer SymptomsUnderstanding Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma: Are You at Risk?Cancer SymptomsSwelling and Discomfort: What Other Symptoms Indicate SarcomaCancer Symptoms10 Symptoms of Lung Cancer that Shouldn’t Be IgnoredCancer Symptoms9 Warning Signs of Liver Cancerconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

What Treatment Options Are Available for Breast Cancer?FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail5 years ago| by Shaina McQuilkie Breast Cancer TreatmentIn recent years, the mortality rate of women diagnosed with breast cancer has declined drastically due to improved health management programs aimed at alleviating and exterminating cancerous tumors in the mammary organs of women.In this article, we’ll touch upon what breast cancer is, and also discuss the three most commonly recommended treatment options for women diagnosed with breast cancer.What Is Breast Cancer?Breast cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the cells of the breast. A malignant tumor refers to a group of cancerous cells that can invade and destroy nearby tissues; additionally, it has the ability to spread to other areas of the body.Cells in the breast occasionally change and fail to grow or behave in a normal way. These changes can lead to either benign breast conditions, including cysts and atypical hyperplasia, or non-malignant tumors such as intraductal papillomas.Conversely, in some individuals the changes in the cells of the breast cause breast cancer. Usually, breast cancer begins in the cells that line the ducts; this type of cancer is known as ductal carcinoma. However, it can also start in the cells of the lobules; this type of cancer is known as lobular carcinoma.Both of these cancers can be in situ, meaning that the cancer remains where it started and has not invaded surrounding tissues, or invasive, meaning that the cancer has spread into surrounding tissues.Other less common types of breast cancer include inflammatory breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and Paget disease of the breast. Rare types of breast cancer include soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.How Is Breast Cancer Treated?The three most commonly recommended conventional treatment options for breast cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation.The type of treatment for each patient depends on various factors including the type of cancer, stage of disease, and patient preference. In some cases, a multidisciplinary approach to treatment may be utilized. Additionally, there are a variety of complementary and alternative options such as yoga, acupuncture, and meditation that may be helpful for some patients when used in conjunction with traditional treatment options.Below we’ll discuss the three most common treatment options in a little more detail so you can better understand each option.Breast Cancer SurgerySurgery is typically the first line of attack against breast cancer and involves removal of the tumor, its surrounding tissues, or the whole breast itself to remove cancerous cells.Breast cancer surgery may include removal of the entire breast, which is known as a mastectomy, or may be breast conserving, which is known as a partial mastectomy.Breast-conserving surgery or partial mastectomy involves the removal of a part of the breast depending on the site and size of the tumor. There are two types of this surgery:Lumpectomy – removal of the lump and a small amount of surrounding tissue.Quadrantectomy – removal of a quarter of the breast tissue.Mastectomy involves the removal of the entire breast. The types of mastectomy include:Total or simple mastectomy – removal of the entire breast and nipple.Nipple-sparing mastectomy – removal of the entire breast without the removal of the nipple to preserve it for reconstructive surgery. This procedure can only be done if the tumor is far from the nipple and if the cancer has not spread to the nipple.Skin-sparing mastectomy – removal of the entire breast without the removal of the skin of the breast.Modified radical mastectomy – removal of the breast and the lymph nodes of the axilla or armpit.Radical mastectomy – removal of the breast, lymph nodes, and muscles under the affected breast.During a mastectomy or partial mastectomy, the surgeon may also perform lymph node removal or sentinel lymph node dissection, if the biopsy has revealed that the cancerous cells have spread outside of the milk duct.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungLung Cancer ImmunotherapyKidney Cancer MedicationsTreat Advanced Breast Cancer You May Also LikeUnderstanding How Radiation Therapy WorksCancer TreatmentsUnderstanding How Radiation Therapy Works8 years ago| by Meredith CrowhurstAbout half of cancer patients in the U.S. receive radiation as part of their cancer treatment. Learn how radiation therapy works and what to expect from it.Radiation Therapy for Breast CancerRadiation therapy involves using high-energy rays to remove and destroy cancer cells. This type of treatment may be given through external beam radiation or brachytherapy.Radiation therapy is usually given to patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery to prevent recurrence of cancer cell growth. Those who have had a mastectomy may undergo radiation therapy as well if the lumps they had are more than 5 cm in size, or if cancer is present in the lymph nodes.External beam radiation is a procedure where a person is exposed to radiation using a machine focused on the affected area. Each treatment session usually lasts for several minutes and is performed five days a week for 5 to 6 weeks.Brachytherapy, also called internal radiation, is a procedure that involves introducing radiation inside the body through radioactive seeds. There are two types of brachytherapy:Interstitial involves placement of catheters with pellets in the area where the cancerous cells were removed and for several periods during the day.Intracavitary involves the placement of a device in place of the tissue that was removed and kept in place until the treatment is finished.Chemotherapy for Breast CancerChemotherapy involves using medications to kill cancer cells in the body. These medications may be given by mouth or via injection into the vein. In many cases, a combination of chemotherapy medications may be used at the same time to improve treatment outcomes.Chemotherapy may be recommended before or after surgery. Chemotherapy is given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy, while chemotherapy given after surgery is called adjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used to decrease the size of the tumor so that operation is less extensive. Adjuvant chemotherapy is used to kill cancer cells after surgery to prevent recurrence of the cancer.There are various side effects chemotherapy including mouth sores, nausea and vomiting, hair loss, changes in appetite, easy bruising, fatigue, and increased risk of infection.Research has shown that standard chemotherapy treatment lowers the risk of recurrence when administered in the early stages of the disease, while it helps to shrink or eliminate cancer in approximately 30 percent to 60 percent of individuals with advanced stages of breast cancer.ConclusionIf you’ve been diagnosed with breast cancer, you’ll want to thoroughly discuss all available breast cancer treatment options with your healthcare provider. Choosing the right treatment option, taking into account all of the risks and side effects of the treatment, is essential to optimize your chance of a full recovery and optimize your quality of life.It’s important to keep in mind that choosing the appropriate treatment option is a decision that is ultimately made by the patient and their loved ones, after taking into account recommendations from various healthcare practitioners.ResourcesCanadian Cancer Society (What is Breast Cancer?)Breastcancer.org (Treatment and Side Effects)National Cancer Institute (Breast Cancer Treatment)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer Symptoms9 Warning Signs of Ovarian CancerLiving With CancerHow to Cope When a Loved One Has CancerLiving With Cancer9 Celebrities Who Have Battled CancerLiving With CancerWhat is Hospice?Cancer AwarenessHow Cancer Cells Start, Grow and SpreadLiving With CancerThe Power of Essential Oils for Cancer Patientsyou may also likeCancer TreatmentsHow Stem Cell Transplants Are Used for Cancer PatientsCancer TreatmentsWhat are White Blood Cell Boosters?Cancer TreatmentsWhat to Expect from Breast Cancer SurgeryCancer TreatmentsThe Latest in Cancer Treatment: Proton Beam Therapyconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Understanding How Cancerous Tumors FormFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail4 years ago| by Katrina Hodgins Important Information on Cancerous TumorsOver time, normal cells may become cancer cells, and these cancer cells may encourage the growth of a tumor. Tumors may be benign or malignant, and there are some important distinctions, especially when it comes to cancerous tumors.What Is a Cancerous Tumor?By biological design, normal cells die off after they grow old or become damaged and are replaced by new cells.Cancerous tumors begin when the old or damaged cells don’t die off, but new cells continue to form. Over time, cells can mutate, and these abnormal cells may not die off when they should, or they keep multiplying. This abundance of extra cells gradually forms lumps of tissue mass in the body, and these tumors vary in type and size.Cancerous tumors are malignant, which is another way of saying they can invade surrounding tissues.Causes of Cancerous TumorsCancerous tumors can start anywhere in the body. Their location usually suggests its shape and how the tumor will grow. But why do these tumors appear in the first place? The cause can be as simple as DNA.There are three main types of genes which contribute to cancer:Proto-oncogenes: these genes are involved in regular cell growth and division. If these genes become abnormal or hyperactive, they may become cancer-causing genes (oncogenes). Oncogenes let cells grow and continue to live when they should die off.Tumor-suppressor genes: these genes are also involved in cell growth and division. Specific abnormalities in these genes may cause cells to divide uncontrollably and may eventually become a tumor.DNA repair genes: it’s no surprise that the job of these genes is to fix damaged DNA. Mutations in these genes can cause additional mutations in the DNA they are supposed to repair. A combination of damaged DNA repair genes and improper DNA maintenance by these genes cause the cells to become cancerous.Many gene mutations you are not born with, but you acquire throughout life. External forces can also cause gene mutations such as smoking (including second-hand smoke), carcinogens, radiation (such as UV radiation), viruses, hormones, chronic inflammation, and obesity.SymptomsSymptoms will depend on the location of the tumor and whether the tumor has invaded nearby tissues that affect other body functions. Symptoms that may appear in tandem with a cancerous tumor are:A lump, or thickening of an area, that can be felt under the skinFatigueUnintended weight changesChanges in bowel or bladder functionDiscomfort or issues after eatingIssues breathingPersistent coughUnexplained joint or muscle painUnexplained fever or night sweatsUnexplained bleeding or bruisingBenign Versus Malignant TumorsTumors can be benign or malignant. When your doctor can diagnose which kind of tumor you have, they will be able to prescribe the proper treatment. There are a few significant differences between benign and malignant tumors.Benign TumorsCells in benign tumors are similar to normal cells, which means that these tumors may grow rather slowly, and they usually have a covering made up of normal cells and are contained within a fibrous connective tissue. These types of tumors typically have a smooth and regular shape.Benign tumors do not spread into healthy tissues, but they can grow to large sizes and cause the surrounding area to have to accommodate the growth. When benign tumors are removed, they seldom grow back, making tumor removal an effective treatment.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungBreast Cancer HelpLung Cancer ImmunotherapyNew Liver Cancer Treatments You May Also LikeEverything You Need to Know About Throat CancerCancer AwarenessEverything You Need to Know About Throat Cancer5 years ago| by Natalie SaundersThroat cancer is a general term which can be used to describe any of the various types of cancer that affect the head, neck, or throat.Malignant TumorsCancerous tumors are the malignant type of tumor. Malignant tumors grow at a faster pace than benign tumors and cause damage to the surrounding tissues. Cancerous tumors have abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably to form the mass.This type of tumor may metastasize to other parts of the body. Cancer cells can break off the tumors and travel through the blood or lymph system to form secondary tumors in other areas.When malignant tumors are surgically removed, there is the possibility that they can grow back, so be aware if any lumps come back after removal.Tumor Grade SystemIf a tumor is suspected to be malignant, a doctor will attempt to remove all of it during a biopsy and examine the tissue to see if it’s benign or malignant.A grading system is used to classify a tumor based on how abnormal the tumor cells look under a microscope. Tumors are classified by the type of cancer, based on their appearance under a microscope and pattern of growth.The purpose of the classification is to indicate how quickly the tumor is expected to grow and spread. And it includes histologic and nuclear grade. There are five grades:GX: The grade cannot be assessed (undetermined grade)G1: Well defined cells (low grade where the cells appear close to normal)G2: Moderately differentiated cells (medium/intermediate grade)G3: Poorly differentiated cells (high grade where the cells do not look normal and spread quickly)G4: Undifferentiated (highest grade)Treatment for Cancerous TumorsDiagnosis and treatment are based on the type, size, stage, and location of the tumor. Some patients only use one treatment, but many patients will use a combination of treatments. Benign tumors often don’t need treatment but may require medical intervention to reduce the size of the tumor, sometimes through surgery.Cancerous tumors are usually treated with one of three methods (each with their own side effects):Chemotherapy: This treatment uses drugs to kill cancer cells. It is a recommended and effective treatment against cancer.Radiation Therapy: This cancer treatment uses high doses of radiation to kill the cancer cells and reduce the size of tumors. There are different types of radiation available.Surgery: The surgeon does a procedure to remove the cancer from the body.Catching a cancerous tumor early is the best line of defense. To give yourself the best chance of locating a cancerous tumor before it spreads, make sure you’re screening yourself for lumps. There are plenty of online resources to check yourself at home, or you can make an appointment with your doctor to give you an examination.By switching to a healthier lifestyle and avoiding carcinogens (and other external forces that cause tumors), we can give ourselves a better chance at preventing a cancerous tumor from appearing.ResourcesNational Cancer Institute (What is Cancer?)National Cancer Institute (Tumor Grade)Healio (What is a Tumor?)Canadian Cancer Society (Types of Tumors)Research UK (How Cancers Grow)Mayo Clinic (Cancer)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer PreventionWhat Are the Causes and Risk Factors of Colon Cancer?Living With Cancer10 Cancer Terms You Should KnowLiving With CancerHow and Why to Raise Cancer AwarenessCancer TreatmentsColon Cancer Treatment PlansCancer PreventionPrevent Breast Cancer in Your ChildrenCancer SymptomsRecognizing the Symptoms of a Carcinoid Tumoryou may also likeCancer AwarenessTrue or False: Are All Tumors Cancerous?Cancer AwarenessWhat to Know About Cachexia and CancerCancer AwarenessEverything You Need to Know About Oral CancerCancer AwarenessImportant Information That You Should Know About Metastatic Pancreatic Cancerconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

CancerLiving.todayMenuAwarenessSymptomsPreventionTreatmentsLiving With CancerSearchSearch Cancer remission means that you are completely cancer-free or partially cancer-free, but cancer may return at a later date. What Does Cancer Remission Mean?FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail5 years ago| by Sheree McDonald What Is Cancer Remission?Cancer is a complex diagnosis that can mean different things for different people. Some diseases are incredibly aggressive and have a very low survival rate while others have a higher chance of going into remission. It’s important for patients and their families to understand cancer remission and what it means for the long-term.Types of Cancer RemissionEssentially, remission means that the body does not have cancer or has improved considerably. There are two types of remission when it comes to cancer.Complete RemissionComplete remission means that the doctor can no longer see any signs of cancer in the body. However, it’s important that even in the case of complete remission; there may be microscopic cancer cells that can’t be detected with the current medical technology.Partial RemissionPartial remission indicates that cancer has shrunk or stabilized for a period of time. Usually, partial remission is determined if a tumor size has decreased by 50 percent and has remained that size for at least one month.While partial remission may improve the quality of life of a patient, patients should understand that the cancer is still present and active in the body. Keep in mind, while complete remission may be favorable news to a patient, it does not mean that cancer will never return to the body.Remission vs. CuredRemission is not the same as cured. A cancer cure indicates that the disease has been eradicated and will never return to the body. At this time, there is no cure for cancer. Remission essentially means that you are completely cancer-free or partially cancer-free, but cancer may return at a later date. The prognosis for cancer returning depends on a variety of factors, and there is no sure way to determine whether or not cancer will remain in remission.Patients should be aware that the longer they are in remission, the less likely it is that cancer will return. However, doctors disagree about the timeline of remission and what it may mean for patients simply because some cancers have a higher remission rate than others. It is difficult to determine the expected remission of all cancer patients because there are so many variables in each case.How Do You Get in Remission?Your doctor can provide more insight into the specific treatment plan that can help you get to remission. However, some factors will influence the likeliness of this happening. Those factors include:The type of cancer.The stage of cancer.Side effects of treatment options.Overall health.Age of patient.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungTypes of Breast Cancer ChemoLung Cancer ImmunotherapyLung Cancer Treatment Drugs You May Also LikeHow Support Groups Can Help Cancer PatientsLiving With CancerHow Support Groups Can Help Cancer Patients9 years ago| by Pat BratianuHaving cancer stinks.

However, typical methods your doctor may try include:Bone marrow transplant.Radiation therapy.Chemotherapy.Drug therapy.Hormone therapy.Immunotherapy.Your doctor will provide insight into your prognosis and the best avenue for treatment based on your lifestyle and your exact situation.Tips for Staying Cancer-FreeRemaining cancer-free is the goal of every patient and their doctor. Even if your cancer goes into remission, it’s essential to follow the tips that your doctor suggests to increase your chances of remaining cancer-free for many years or even a lifetime.Remember, there is no guarantee that cancer will never return, but you can play an active role in maintaining your health.Some of those tips may include:Continue cancer care. Even if you are in remission, you should continue regular check-ups and evaluations to make sure that cancer has not returned. Remember, early detection is key to treating cancer, and if your doctor can diagnose it early enough then you can increase the chances of it going into remission again.Continue treatments while in partial remission. Your doctor may offer a less aggressive treatment plan while you are in partial remission, but you should continue to treatments as suggested. Remember, partial remission is not total remission, and proper treatments could influence whether cancer goes into complete remission or not. Often, people feel better when their cancer goes into partial remission, but treatment will help keep you feeling better.It’s also important to maintain a healthy diet. Several studies indicate that proper nutrition can help the body remain cancer-free.Avoid smoking.Maintain an active lifestyle by exercising or participating in some other regular physical activity a few times per week.Don’t forget the emotional toll that cancer can take on your mind. Stress and anxiety can influence remission rates. Ask your doctor about support groups in your area.OverviewCancer remission is undoubtedly good news for the patient. It’s important for patients to celebrate their remission and remain optimistic about their future. However, your doctor can discuss statistics for the future and tips for bettering your chances of remaining cancer-free for years to come.If you would like more information about cancer remission, rely on the expertise of your medical provider.ResourcesWebMD (Remission: What Does It Mean?)Mesothelioma (What Is Cancer Remission?)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer AwarenessBenign vs. Malignant Tumors: Understanding the DifferenceCancer TreatmentsMedical Marijuana: Can It Really Help Cancer Patients?Cancer AwarenessDoes Nicotine Cause Cancer?Cancer Awareness10 Things You Need to Know About Breast CancerCancer Symptoms10 Symptoms of Lung Cancer that Shouldn’t Be IgnoredCancer SymptomsUnderstanding Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma: Are You at Risk?you may also likeLiving With Cancer9 Tips for Telling Loved Ones You Have CancerLiving With CancerWhat to Eat During ChemoLiving With CancerUnderstanding the Different Types of Breast ReconstructionLiving With CancerHow and Why to Raise Cancer Awarenessconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Understanding the 6 Common Types of Childhood CancerFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail4 years ago| by Shaina McQuilkie What Are the Different Types of Childhood Cancer?Having a child diagnosed with cancer is the worst nightmare of every parent. Watching an innocent child fight childhood cancer is heart wrenching and can have a devastating effect on families.The statistics on childhood cancer are shocking; every two minutes a child is diagnosed with cancer in the world, 1 in 285 children are diagnosed with cancer before the age of 20 in the U.S. and cancer is the second leading cause of death in children, after accidental injuries.What Is Childhood Cancer?Childhood cancer refers to cancer in children under the age of 15. Cancer among children can be quite different from adult cancers in terms of how it spreads, available treatment methods and their response to treatment.Causes of Childhood CancerThe exact cause of most childhood cancers remains unknown. However, it is believed that most childhood cancer cases are the result of gene mutation that causes abnormal cell growth resulting in cancer. Although certain environmental exposures play a vital role in causing cancer in adults, pinpointing environmental factors that trigger cancer in children has proven to be quite difficult.Types of Childhood CancerThere are more than 100 different types of cancers. Some of the most common types of cancers found in children:LeukemiaLymphomaBrain CancerNeuroblastomaRhabdomyosarcomaOsteosarcoma or bone cancerLeukemiaLeukemia, cancer of bone marrow cells, is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in children, accounting for 28% of all childhood cancer cases in the U.S.Bone marrow produces red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. White blood cells are responsible for fighting various types of infections. However, when a child has leukemia, their bone marrow produces immature and abnormal white cells that are unable to fight the invading infection.Eventually, these mutated white blood cells outnumber the healthy blood cells within the body, resulting in infections and prolonged bleeding after injury. Leukemia has the potential to metastasize and spread from the bone marrow, through the blood vessels, to all parts of the body.

The lymphatic system consists of the lymph nodes, thymus gland, spleen and bone marrow. All these elements combined form the body’s germ-fighting network or immune system. Like leukemia, lymphoma also produces weak white blood cells that end up crowding the healthy lymphoid cells of the body. The two types of lymphoma – Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s - are responsible for 6% of the childhood cancer cases in the U.S. Common symptoms:Oval or round shaped painless swelling of the lymph nodes located in the neck, groin, and/or armpit regionPersistent weakness and fatigueFeverItchy skinBreathing difficultiesUnexplained weight lossBrain CancerChildhood brain cancer is caused by abnormal cell growth in the brain or surrounding tissues. The tumors formed due to unnatural cell division can be either cancerous (malignant), or non-cancerous (benign). Four types of brain cancers are common in children and adolescents:Astrocytoma: cancer of the supportive brain tissues or astrocytesBrain-stem gliomas: cancer at the base of the brain or spinal cordEpendymoma: cancer of the ependymal cells in the lining of the brain’s ventricles where the cerebrospinal fluids are producedPrimitive neuroectodermal tumors: cancer of the primitive nerve cells of the brainAs brain tumors grow, they apply pressure and alter the function of surrounding nervous tissue, which can result in symptoms such as headaches, nausea, seizures, blurred vision and memory problems.NeuroblastomaNeuroblastoma is characterized by abnormal growth of immature nerve cells, mostly in the adrenal glands located on top of the kidneys. However, it can also develop in the chest, abdomen, neck, or the spinal region. 90% of the cases of neuroblastoma are found in children under the age of 5. Common symptoms:Abdominal painDiarrhea or constipationChest painDrooping eyelidsFormation of lumps under the skinProtruding eyeballsBack painFeverBone aches and tendernessRhabdomyosarcomaRhabdomyosarcoma is cancer of the soft skeletal muscle tissues. It can also begin in the hollow organs such as the bladder and uterus. Although it is rare, it is more prevalent in children than in adults. Symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma include swelling or lumps in the arms or legs, blood in the urine with irregular bowel movements, headaches and nosebleeds.Bone CancerBone cancer is initiated by the formation of painful lumps on bones that restrict the growth of normal bones and hinders stability. It typically affects the pelvis and the longer bones of the body like the arms and legs. Bone cancers can potentially spread to the lungs and other bones and soft tissues. Common symptoms:Bone pain that comes and goesPain that does not respond to pain medicationSwelling and tenderness around the affected areaWeakened bone that fractures easilyFatigueTreatment for Childhood CancerCancer treatment depends on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. The common types of treatments are chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy and stem cell transplants.Any of these procedures can be prescribed as a standalone treatment, in combination with one another, or as palliative care if the cancer is too advanced. Some of these treatments have short-term and long-term side effects. It’s important to discuss the potential risks with a pediatric oncologist.In ConclusionHaving a child diagnosed with cancer can be very hard, but parents need to stay focused and keep their child motivated. It takes a combined effort of doctors, parents and the child to overcome cancer. Every year, there are breakthroughs in childhood cancer research and treatment. With proper treatment and rehabilitation, your child can hopefully live a very long and productive life.ResourcesNIH (Cancer in Children and Adolescents)healthychildren.org (Types of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers)MedlinePlus (Cancer in Children)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsLiving With CancerUnderstanding the Different Types of Breast ReconstructionCancer PreventionWhy You Should Examine Yourself for Breast CancerCancer SymptomsTop 8 Signs of Childhood LeukemiaCancer Symptoms11 Symptoms of Liver Cancer You Shouldn’t IgnoreLiving With CancerFeeling the Fear of CancerLiving With CancerEnjoying the Holidays Despite a Cancer Diagnosisyou may also likeCancer AwarenessDoes Talcum Powder Causes Ovarian Cancer?Cancer AwarenessUnderstanding and Battling Uterine and Endometrial CancerCancer AwarenessUnderstanding How Cancerous Tumors FormCancer AwarenessTrue or False: Are All Tumors Cancerous?connect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

CancerLiving.todayMenuAwarenessSymptomsPreventionTreatmentsLiving With CancerSearchSearch Cryoablation for cancer is a type of treatment that freezes the cancer-affected area in the body. Cryoablation: An Alternative Cancer TreatmentFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail4 years ago| by Katrina Hodgins Cryoablation for CancerWith cryoablation for cancer, the term “freezing to death” is not an exaggeration, but a fitting description. This type of treatment literally causes cells to freeze and die off—including cancer cells.What Is Cryoablation for Cancer?Cryoablation is a minimally invasive cancer treatment that uses intense cold to treat small tumors. Also referred to as cryosurgery or cryotherapy, cryoablation treats other conditions such as pre-cancerous skin moles, skin tags, nodules, retinoblastomas and more.Cryoablation targets diseased tissues and freezes that tissue using a tool called a cryoprobe. The cryoprobe is a small, wand-like needle that is inserted through the skin directly into a tumor. Gas pumps from tanks into the cryoprobe, causing the tissue to freeze. The tissue is given time to thaw and is then blasted with another round of freezing gas. This freeze and thaw cycle is repeated several times throughout a single treatment session.Is Cryoablation Used to Treat Cancer?Cryoablation targets, freezes and destroys diseased tissue, including cancer cells. This treatment helps relieve both pain and symptoms caused by cancer, and it can effectively target the affected areas. In some cases, cryoablation may be the primary treatment for bone, cervical, eye, kidney, liver, lung and prostate cancer.How Cryoablation Kills Cancer CellsLiving tissues, both healthy and diseased, are not meant to endure intense cold. There are a few ways that cryoablation works:Cellular dehydration occurs when ice forms in the fluid outside the cellsIce forms within the cell and the cell is destroyed by ice crystalsThe cell bursts due to swelling from ice expanding within the cellA loss of blood supply to the cellCryoablation Treatment ProcessPreparationLeading up to your appointment, your doctor or specialist provides preparation instructions. Prior to giving the green light for cryoablation, they will need to know of any recent illnesses, medical conditions, allergies, current medications (including supplements), whether you are pregnant and other information that may affect treatment. Your doctor may advise you to stop taking certain drugs, such as aspirin or blood thinners, prior to the procedure. As a safeguard against infection on the day of the procedure, you may be given a dose of antibiotics or moderate sedation to manage discomfort.Tools and TechnologyCryoablation uses a few tools during treatment. Of course, the cryoprobe is an important component, as it dispenses the liquid nitrogen or argon gas to the diseased tissue site. A computer controls the flow of gas from the tanks to ensure the right amount is dispensed. To direct the cryoprobes to the treatment sites inside the body, the specialist uses imaging guidance, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance (MR).How Cryoablation Treatment WorksIn order to kill cells, the doctor needs to freeze and thaw the cells for at least two cycles. To treat tissue on the skin’s surface, such as a skin tag, the cold treatment is applied topically using a cotton swab or spray device. For treatment of tissues inside the body, the physician makes a small incision at the site just big enough to insert the cryoprobe, which delivers the gas once it’s in place. After the cancer cells are destroyed, your white blood cells swarm the area to remove the dead tissue.RecoveryThe procedure takes up to three hours depending on how many cycles of freezing and thawing are needed. After the cryoprobe is removed, the physician applies pressure to stop any bleeding. Usually the incision is so small, sutures are not necessary. An overnight stay is generally not required for cryoablation and recovery time is pretty quick. The procedure results are sent to your referring physician and you may need to schedule a follow-up visit to check on your recovery progress.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungCancer Immunotherapy TreatmentTypes of Breast Cancer ChemoTreat Advanced Prostate Cancer You May Also LikeWhat are White Blood Cell Boosters?Cancer TreatmentsWhat are White Blood Cell Boosters?4 years ago| by Sheree McDonaldWhite blood cell boosters during chemo are used to help regrow white blood cells to help fight infection.

Possible side effects:PainBleedingInfectionLower body temperatureDoes Cryoablation Treatment Work?Studies show positive results in select patients, particularly in treatment of the bones, kidneys, liver and lungs. Since this is still considered a newer treatment there, is not much information available for the long-term effectiveness of cryoablation. Studies and research are ongoing to determine the long-term outcomes for this freezing treatment.Cryoablation offers another option for treatment of cancer and other conditions; your doctor can help determine if cryoablation is a suitable treatment for you.ResourcesMayo Clinic (Cryoablation for cancer)Canadian Cancer Society (Cryosurgery)RadiologyInfo.org (Cryotherapy)Cleveland Clinic (Cryoablation) FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer Awareness8 Things Every Man Should Know About Prostate CancerCancer AwarenessAre Skin Tags a Sign of Skin Cancer?Cancer AwarenessDo These Everyday Ingredients Cause Cancer?Cancer AwarenessMetastatic Cancer: Why Cancer SpreadsCancer AwarenessWhat to Know About Cachexia and CancerCancer AwarenessDoes Nicotine Cause Cancer?you may also likeCancer TreatmentsWhat to Expect from Breast Cancer SurgeryCancer TreatmentsHow Stem Cell Transplants Are Used for Cancer PatientsCancer TreatmentsUnderstanding How Radiation Therapy WorksCancer TreatmentsWhat Treatment Options Are Available for Breast Cancer?connect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Diet Tips for Bone Cancer PatientsFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail4 years ago| by Shaina McQuilkie An All-Around Bone Cancer DietBone cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells that make up the bone tissue. The most likely place of origination of this cancer is the pelvis, however, other long bones of the arms and legs are also commonly affected. This type of cancer is extremely rare, making up only 1% of all reported cancer cases. In this article, we talk about what a good diet for bone cancer is, as some foods are better to eat than others with this condition.Types of Bone CancerPrimary bone cancers:Osteosarcoma (knee and/or upper arm)Ewing's sarcoma (upper arm, pelvis, ribs, and/or legs)Chondrosarcoma (cartilage of the shoulder, hips, arms, and/or legs)Symptoms of Bone CancerMost bone cancers are diagnosed incidentally when being evaluated for different issues, such as a sprain or fracture. However, bone cancer may present with the following symptoms:Unexplained bone painSwelling or tenderness without associated injuryFragile bones that easily fractureFatigueWeight lossNight SweatsFeverTreatment of Bone CancerBased on the type of cancer and the stage of the disease, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery may be recommended as either standalone treatments, or used in combination to achieve desired results.Ideal Diet for Bone CancerGetting proper nutrition is very important for patients fighting bone cancer. Cancer itself, along with the therapies used to treat it, may alter your body’s ability to process food. Therefore, a high-calorie, high-protein diet is recommended before and during treatment to help maintain energy levels and a stable weight.Related Search Topics Types of Breast Cancer ChemoLung Cancer ImmunotherapyLung Cancer Treatments Lung Cancer Treatment Drugs You May Also LikeHow Cancer Changes Your Outlook on LifeLiving With CancerHow Cancer Changes Your Outlook on Life8 years ago| by Pat BratianuThere's no denying how cancer changes your outlook on life. But there are ways to cope through the disease and stay as positive as possible.Diet Before TreatmentYou must start eating healthy to prepare yourself for bone cancer treatment. In addition to reserving your strength, it will boost your immune system to help you fight off infections. Maintaining a healthy diet may also help you cope with the side effects of cancer treatment, and deal with a higher dosage of medication, if necessary.Your diet before starting cancer treatment should look like:High protein foods: dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt), eggs, chicken and lean red meat, fish, beans, seeds and nutsHigh-calorie foods: dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt), gravies, salad dressing and saucesDiet During Cancer TreatmentYour diet during your cancer treatment will differ depending on the treatment you receive.For SurgeryIf you have had cancer surgery, you will need to consume more calories and protein to encourage your body to heal. Frequent small snacks and meals, as well as plenty of water to prevent hydration are recommended. Try to avoid greasy and/or fried foods as they can be hard to digest.For RadiationIf you are undergoing radiation therapy, it is recommended that you eat something before each treatment session. Again, frequent, small meals and snacks, as well as adequate hydration are recommended. Try to plan larger meals at times during the day when you feel your best.For ChemotherapyIf you are receiving chemotherapy, the nausea associated with treatment can severely impact your desire to eat. Consuming a small, healthy snack prior to treatment can help to ward off the nausea associated with treatment. It’s important to eat when you are feeling good and be sure to consume a sufficient amount of quality calories, including protein, during these times to help boost your energy. Frequent, small meals and snacks, as well as adequate water consumption to stay hydrated can be beneficial when you are not feeling well. Try to avoid greasy and/or fried foods as they can be difficult to digest.Diet After TreatmentAfter successful completion of your cancer treatment, it is essential to consume a healthy diet to aid your recovery. Ideally, your diet after bone cancer treatment should look like:Five to seven small snacks or meals containing a variety of fruits and veggiesHigh-fiber foods including cereals and whole-grain breadsAvoid greasy and/or fried goods, opt for baked or broiled options insteadDairy productsIt’s also important to limit your alcohol consumption (one drink per day for women, and two drinks per day for men).Dietary Supplements for Bone CancerDietary supplements are beneficial, as they help to address some of the nutritional deficiencies you may experience during bone cancer treatment.Commonly recommended supplements:Multivitamins containing vitamins A, B-complex, C, E and trace minerals like calcium, magnesium, selenium and zincOmega 3 fatty acids in fish oil to boost your immunity and decrease inflammationCalcium and vitamin D to strengthen your bonesProbiotic supplements for gastrointestinal healthBefore taking any supplement, it is essential to discuss it with your oncologist and nutritionist.Foods to AvoidIt’s important that you and/or your family member be cautious when handling, cooking and storing food. Additionally, avoiding certain foods is recommended:Cold hot dogs (ensure that hot dogs are cooked until they are steaming hot)Processed meatUnpasteurized milk including raw milk and yogurtSmoked fishRefrigerated pâtéUnwashed vegetables and fruitsUnpasteurized fruit juiceRaw sproutsUndercooked beef and other meatsIn ConclusionUnfortunately, there is no miraculous diet that will cure your cancer or prevent it from coming back.

Facing the changing weather is challenging. Pushing through the crowds in the stores is a struggle. Balancing the wants of others against your own needs adds to your level of stress.Although this time of year is meant to be a joyful celebration, the pressure and anxiety have a tendency to overwhelm the positives and make the whole time of year a negative, arduous journey.Now you have another problem to contend with, but this is not only a seasonal issue. It is a situation that is long lasting and life changing — cancer.Unfortunately, your cancer does not take a break during the holiday season. It does not alleviate mid-November and resume on the first of the year.This unrelenting condition will make good situations bad and bad situations worse if you allow it. Rather than succumbing to the weight of cancer during the holidays, choose to combat the stress.By practicing prevention and addressing your needs, you can make the holidays with cancer better than those of the past.Care for Your Physical HealthCancer is primarily a physical health condition. Because of this, you need to do everything in your power to ensure your physical health is as good as it can be.If your physical health is suffering, the stress and responsibilities of the holidays will compound. Everything will feel worse. To combat this, consider the following:Follow your doctor’s recommendations. If you trust your doctor and treatment team, it will be essential to follow their recommendations to create the best situation for your physical health.Eat well. Cancer and the treatment that follows commonly lead to many issues with appetite. Plus, your energy will be lower, which makes the prospect of standing in front of the stove preparing a meal much less appealing. Without healthy foods, you cannot function at your best. During the holidays, there will be ample opportunities to indulge in comfort foods, but do so in moderation.Exercise. Just like with eating well, the lack of energy associated with cancer treatment will make exercise an afterthought. Work to change this trend for better results. Exercise will improve your physical health greatly, but it will lower stress and boost your mental health along the way.Sleep well. Speaking of physical health measures that improve your mental health, try to renew your focus on restful sleep. Do not accept poor sleep as an effect of cancer. Along with diet and exercise, sleep is a very useful tool to lower stress, aid in your recovery, and improve your decision-making skills. These benefits are needed during the holidays more than any other time.Care for Your Mental HealthCaring for your physical health will set the stage for you to manage holiday stress, but the real work will be done with your mental health. Yes, cancer is physical, but the implications extend well into your mental health status.Related Search Topics Breast Cancer HelpNew Liver Cancer TreatmentsKidney Cancer MedicationsTreat Advanced Breast Cancer You May Also Like9 Tips for Telling Loved Ones You Have CancerLiving With Cancer9 Tips for Telling Loved Ones You Have Cancer9 years ago| by Eric PattersonAfter getting the cancer diagnosis you will have to inform others in your life about the news. Follow these tips for telling loved ones you have cancer.Inspect Your Self-TalkSelf-talk is the ongoing conversation you have with yourself throughout the day. Self-talk plays a massive role in influencing your feelings.Often, self-talk can be overly negative and irrational, which could change your views of the holidays. You can never be sure of the holiday outcomes, and thinking poorly about the gatherings may lead to self-fulfilling prophecies where your views influence your perceptions.To overcome this, focus on the positive interactions that could come with the visit. Arriving with a sense of hope will improve your chances of better outcomes.Modify Your ExpectationsHolidays are times of great traditions and routines. You may feel a large amount of pressure to maintain the activities in the past even though you are not physically able to this year.Conversely, you may feel like you can no longer do anything with your diagnosis and cancel all of your plans. Modifying your expectations means that you arrive at conclusions that match your abilities with doing too much or too little.If you expect too much of yourself, you could be let down and feel like a failure. If you expect too little, you could miss out on some healthy interactions.RelaxYou already know the holidays add to your stress, and you know cancer adds to your stress. Because of the double intensity, you need to find double the stress relief.Much of this can come from forms of relaxation. Engaging in specific relaxation techniques like deep breathing, guided imagery, autogenics, and progressive muscle relaxation will manage your stress quickly and efficiently.Other options like yoga and forms of meditation will be very helpful as well. Sitting on the couch, swiping through social media, and consuming alcohol and other drugs are passive experiences and do not create much relaxation. They may even make stress worse.Clarify Your CommunicationOnce your expectations are established, communicate your plans to the important people in your life. Remember, they have been developing their own expectations of you and the holidays along the way.Chances are good that their expectations do not match yours, so communicating your stance will be crucial. Practice negotiation skills to balance your needs with their wants.The best communication will continue on an ongoing basis before, during, and after the holiday season to ensure that your message is received. Focus your communication on being:ClearRespectfulBased on “I messages”SpecificPrepared rather than spontaneousShow WeaknessA great deal of stress develops when your presentation does not match your feelings. Acting like you are carefree when you actually have high levels of worry, anxiety, and fear is disingenuous, breeds stress, and damages relationships.Letting people know and understand your situation will allow them to assist to the best of their abilities. If you worry about being tearful or outwardly irritable, let the other people know what they can expect and what they can do to help.Two stressors make any situation more challenging, but it does not have to be impossible. Approach the holidays with cancer by targeting your physical health and mental health to find ways to succeed in the stress. You do not have to be superhuman; you only have to be yourself.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer Symptoms9 Warning Signs of Liver CancerCancer SymptomsRecognizing the Symptoms of a Carcinoid TumorCancer TreatmentsHow Is Immunotherapy Different from Chemotherapy?Cancer AwarenessCauses of Lung CancerCancer AwarenessChronic Myeloid LeukemiaCancer AwarenessUnderstanding the 6 Common Types of Childhood Canceryou may also likeLiving With Cancer9 Celebrities Who Have Battled CancerLiving With CancerHow to Cope When a Loved One Has CancerLiving With CancerHow Support Groups Can Help Cancer PatientsLiving With CancerDepression, Anxiety, Stress and Cancerconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

At first, I was reluctant to attend. I had little energy and was sick from surgery and chemotherapy. The last thing I wanted to do was meet more sick people – it sounded like it would be depressing. However, my oncologist thought that I would benefit from going to a meeting and so I went.Do I Have the Courage and Energy to Attend a Meeting?The group that I initially attended was for people who had all kinds of cancer. I felt overwhelmed when I went in. Some of the people there looked so sick. Frankly, it scared me.Then people started talking. And again I felt scared because some of the group members were facing cancer for their second and third time. That really freaked me out. Here I was, horribly ill from chemotherapy, and having to hear about the possibility that this terrible disease might come back! I wanted to run away and never go back.But I did go back, at the urging of family and my health care team. One of my co-workers had cancer a year before I did and she said that she felt like people in the support group understood how she felt better than people who had never been diagnosed with the disease. That made sense to me. It also helped that she attended the next meetings with me.Sharing is CaringI did find the support group helpful. My co-worker was right, the people in the group did “get it” about the emotional roller coaster ride. They also understood how terrible the side effects of treatment made me feel.However, if that had been all I gained from the group I don’t think I would have continued going. But I found that other cancer overcomers (I dislike the term “survivors”) were generous and caring. They offered practical advice for controlling symptoms of the ever-present nausea.I learned how to navigate the health care system better with their help than I had while working as a nurse. The support group helped me to understand what clinical trials are. I discussed this with my oncologist and was able to participate in a trial.Help For the Whole FamilyOne of the greatest benefits was the strain that it took off of my family. I was young when I was diagnosed with cancer. I was a mom, full-time nurse, and full-time student. My family was not used to me being ill, teary and helpless. My husband and I had no idea how we would manage financially or even how to get me back and forth to the hospital for treatments.By joining the support group, I learned about the community resources that were available to me, including a food shelf, medical transportation volunteers and programs that helped us to pay for utilities.My children linked up with other children whose parents were going through treatment too. It gave them a forum for sharing their own fears.Support Groups Are EmpoweringI found that the members of the cancer support group were strong in many ways. They recognized that each person had to follow the treatment and life path they thought best, but they held me accountable for how I dealt with the challenges cancer presented.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungKidney Cancer MedicationsTreat Metastatic Breast CancerNew Cancer Pill You May Also LikeDepression, Anxiety, Stress and CancerLiving With CancerDepression, Anxiety, Stress and Cancer8 years ago| by Eric PattersonA cancer diagnosis carries huge amounts of emotional weight; fear grows like weeds in a garden. Stress and cancer has a large impact on your mental health.When you are home alone, crying that you have a terrible diagnosis, it is only natural to feel sorry for yourself and wonder, “Why me?” When you are sitting in a room full of people who have cancer it is harder to feel sorry for yourself. I found myself developing an attitude of, “Well if she can get through this, so can I.” Despite my illness, I realized that I could help others with just a hug or kind word.Different Kinds of Cancer Support GroupsAttending a cancer support group is likely not at all what you think it will be like. You will witness heartbreak, absolute joy, laughter, and camaraderie. Some groups sponsor activities like dinners. The first dinner that I attended made me nauseous, but the support made it worth it.Support groups are sometimes formed to address specific kinds of cancer. You can learn a great deal about your disease in any support group, however, ones that address your specific type of cancer are usually the best ones to attend if you are looking for information.Support groups sometimes invite speakers to attend meetings. They may be experts in cancer treatment, nutritionists, or alternative medicine practitioners. You don’t just learn about cancer. You can learn how to live life well.Nourishing the SpiritFor many people, attending a support group has a spiritual component. It is an important, often overlooked, aspect of healing from cancer.Doctors and health care experts are often so focused on blood counts, managing side effects, medications, and other treatments that they overlook the impact that cancer has on your mind, body, and spirit.I think most of the time it’s not that health care workers are unkind, it is simply that they are focused on destroying the cancer and saving lives. Support groups help cancer overcomers create new, better lives for themselves.Find the Right Fit For YouNot every support group is best for everyone. If you attend one and it doesn’t feel right for you, try another one. All support groups have a variety of attendees. Avoid groups that claim they have “the “answer.” Many groups have one or two members who think that their way or their doctor is “the answer” to cancer.Remember that every person and every cancer is different. Just because three people have stage three breast cancer does not mean that the cancers are alike.Focus on Lasting WellnessBeing a member of a cancer support group made me gain a confidence in myself that I had not experienced so strongly even before I was diagnosed. It made me kinder, more patient, and a better nurse. I learned to appreciate each moment and fret less over small things. I enjoy life more now. I feel less self-conscious about being silly and playful.Having cancer stinks. Joining a support group can provide you with tools to make it less isolating and more tolerable. You’ll develop relationships and tools to help make your life after cancer more meaningful and satisfying than it was before you had the disease.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer AwarenessWhat Causes Bladder Cancer?Cancer SymptomsThe Causes, Signs and Symptoms of MesotheliomaCancer Symptoms7 Signs of Eye Cancer You Shouldn’t IgnoreCancer TreatmentsWhat are White Blood Cell Boosters?Cancer AwarenessChronic Myeloid LeukemiaCancer AwarenessUnderstanding the 6 Common Types of Childhood Canceryou may also likeLiving With CancerHow and Why to Raise Cancer AwarenessLiving With CancerCoping with CancerLiving With Cancer9 Celebrities Who Have Battled CancerLiving With CancerJournaling for Cancer Patientsconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Some cancers are not easily identified, whereas others, such as skin cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer and oral cancer, can be identified fairly easily if you know what to look for.Skin CancerThe Skin Cancer Foundation recommends that a head-to-toe self-examination be done monthly. Follow the steps outlined below to perform a self-exam:Examine your face closely. Pay close attention to your ears, nose, lips and mouth. Use a hand mirror to get a closer look.Inspect the scalp carefully. Use a blow dryer with a mirror or a friend in order to view all areas of the scalp effectively.Examine the hands. Make sure to examine in between the fingers, your palms, and under the fingernails. Next move to the wrists and the forearms, front and back.Examine all surfaces of the arms. Use a full-length mirror so you can see every angle.View the chest, neck and torso. Do not forget to lift the breasts to view the undersides.Check your back. Using a hand-held mirror and the full-length mirror, stand with your back to the full-length mirror and examine the back, neck, and shoulders.Continuing in the same position, scan lower legs, buttocks and lower back.Sitting down, use a mirror to examine the genitals. Examine each leg — check the front and back, thigh and shin, ankles and feet.Should you find any freckle or bump that is suspicious, it is helpful to know your ABCDEs:Asymmetry – the freckle is not symmetrical.Border – the border is irregular.Color – the color varies or has shades of tan, brown or black, sometimes white, red or blue.Diameter – a melanoma is typically greater than 6mm.Evolving – a mole that looks different than the rest or is changing in shape, color or size.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungBreast Cancer HelpLung Cancer ImmunotherapyLung Cancer Treatment Drugs You May Also Like10 Things You Can Do to Prevent Skin CancerCancer Prevention10 Things You Can Do to Prevent Skin Cancer9 years ago| by Angie FinlaySkin cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer, and arguably the most preventable.Breast CancerThe National Breast Cancer Foundation recommends performing a self-exam of the breasts monthly. According to Johns Hopkins Medical center, “Forty percent of breast cancers are detected by women who feel a lump, so establishing a regular breast self-exam is very important.”The steps for a breast self-exam are as follows:In the shower, use the pads of the fingers and move around the entire breast in a circular pattern from the outside to the center. Include the armpit area. Check both breasts. Note any lumps, thickening or hardened knots.In front of a mirror, visually inspect your breasts. First keep your hands at your sides, then raise them over your head. Notice any changes in contour, swelling, dimpling of the skin, or changes in the nipples. Place hands on the hips, flexing chest muscles. Look for dimpling and puckering.While lying down, place a pillow behind the right shoulder and the right arm behind the head. Using the left hand, move the fingers around the breast in a circular motion. Use light, medium and firm pressure. Squeeze the nipple to check for discharge. Repeat on the other breast.Testicular CancerAccording to the Testicular Cancer Society, testicular self-exams should be performed monthly. They note that men find most testicular cancers during a self-exam or by their partner, not by their physician, so doing the exam is important.The steps for performing a self-exam can be followed below:After a warm bath or shower, when the scrotum is relaxed, stand in front of a mirror. Note any swelling of the scrotal skin.Examine each testicle with both hands. Place the thumb on the top of the testicle and the index finger and middle finger under the testicle; firmly but gently, roll the testicle between your fingers. Note any irregularities.Find the epididymis, a rope-like structure on the back of the testicle. It is important to identify this structure so it is not falsely identified as a lump.Repeat the steps on the other testicle.Oral CancerThe American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons recommends performing an oral cancer self-exam monthly. Doing so can detect cancer in the early stages; oral cancer typically has a high mortality — because it is often diagnosed in the later stages. It is estimated that 42,000 Americans will be diagnosed with oral or pharyngeal cancer this year.The steps for performing an oral exam can be found below:Remove any dentures that may be present.Look into the mouth — check and feel inside the lips and the front of the gums.Tilting the head back, examine and feel the roof of the mouth.Pull the cheeks out to visualize the inner surface and the back of the gums.Pull out the tongue; look at all surfaces.Feel for any lumps or enlarged lymph nodes in the neck.What to look for:Leukoplakia (white patches of the oral tissue)Erythroplakia (red patches)Erythroleukoplakia (red and white patches)A sore throat that does not heal and bleedsAbnormal lump of the mouth and/or neckHoarsenessDifficulty chewing or swallowingShould you note anything of concern while performing any of these monthly self-exams, please contact your physician.ResourcesAmerican Academy of Dermatology (What to Look for: ABCDEs of Melanoma)American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (Head, Neck and Oral Pathology)National Breast Cancer Foundation (Breast Self-Exam)Skin Cancer Foundation (Step by Step Self-Examination)Testicular Cancer Society (Testicular Self Exam)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer Awareness10 Things You Need to Know About Breast CancerCancer TreatmentsRadiation or Chemo?

Journaling for Cancer PatientsFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail9 years ago| by Eric Patterson Photo Credit: petrograd99 / istockphoto.comJournaling for CancerCancer is a powerful force. When it enters your life, you have to call on all of your trusted coping skills to deal with the physical and psychological stresses that result.You may be working on improving your diet and sleep, trying to exercise, and spending more time with loved ones, but your current coping skills still may not offer enough.If they come up short, you will be left feeling increasingly anxious, depressed, hopeless, frustrated and fearful. Without the best types of positive coping skills, you will be more likely to seek the comfort of negative coping skills. Negative coping skills are only focused on short term benefit while sacrificing long-term gains.A fantastic positive coping skill that is not done often enough is journaling. Especially for someone undergoing cancer treatment, journaling offers much in the way of benefits, with very few risks. The process is 100% controlled by you so you do not have to depend on others to facilitate.If you aren’t sure about the good that can come from journaling, take some time to consider what journaling can do and how you can become a success at it.Why Journaling?Whenever people hear journaling, they think it’s only a self-indulgent behavior that 12-year-old girls use to keep secrets about boys. Sure, this is part of journaling, but it can be so much more for you. Put aside those faulty notions for a clear understanding of what journaling can do.The most important thing that journaling creates is an outlet for you to express yourself. Right now, you probably have innumerable thoughts swirling through your mind. You’re probably pretty sure that your head is going to explode off your neck. Journaling can help release the tension.Journaling gives you the opportunity to blow off steam in a safe, productive way. This ability to “get it all out” will free up room so that you can accept new information and feelings without being entirely overwhelmed. Journaling gives you a forum that is free from judgment and opinions of other people. You can write whatever you want, however you want. There is a sense of complete freedom that is hard to find ordinarily. You can curse God, life or the universe on the pages of your journal and no one has to see it.Another great pro of journaling is its ability to help you process your thoughts and feelings. Having cancer is anything but simple. It creates such a mix of emotions like fear, anger, worry, shock, sadness and guilt. The emotions are paired with thoughts about people’s response to you, your doctors’ level of commitment to you and disappointment in your current state. It can be hard to know what to think and how to feel.Journaling lets you free your thoughts and feelings from the prison of your mind. Seeing them in black and white helps to understand your triggers, judgments, and biases, which gives you the chance to rework your thinking to arrive at a new conclusion if you are not satisfied with the outcomes. Journaling lets you see your thoughts and feelings as things that are more flexible and fluid than you may have previously considered.During this process, you become better able to express your needs to others. During your diagnosis and treatment, it will be uncomfortable to constantly ask people for assistance. You might not even know what you need or what will make you feel better mentally or physically. This process is still new to you. By journaling, you can learn ways to communicate more effectively to the people around you. The pages of your journal give you the opportunity to engage in trial and error of effective communication. If you are having trouble speaking to someone in your life, write it in your journal to refine your message before deciding to say it out loud.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungCancer Immunotherapy TreatmentKidney Cancer MedicationsLung Cancer Treatment Drugs You May Also LikeWhat is Hospice?Living With CancerWhat is Hospice?9 years ago| by Pat BratianuHospice is a service for those who are unlikely to live for more than 6 months; patients and their loved ones can live well despite the terminal diagnosis.As if the previous benefits of journaling weren’t enough, consider that journaling also allows you to know yourself. Knowing yourself is one the best ways to combat depression, anxiety or any other mental health concern that accompanies your cancer diagnosis and treatment. When you journal, you begin to connect the dots of your life. You find patterns and trends with your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in ways that you never have previously. You can see how your past influences your present. Knowing yourself allows you to prevent problems before they develop and to look for the solutions that you employed in the past.Of course, you can never prevent all problems from surfacing. Journaling allows you to solve problems because journaling allows you to be objective to yourself and the world around you. It gives you the power to solve new problems better than ever before. You can look at yourself with increased accuracy, and you can understand the people around you with more empathy.Empathy is the act of putting yourself in someone else’s shoes to know what it’s like to be them. Empathy is essential for conflict resolution, and it is something that tends to diminish during treatment because more of your energies are focused on you.Too many people think that journaling is only set in the past. A really interesting method to journaling is having it focused on your goals for the future. What do you want to work on? Many people fail to complete goals because they lack the needed consistency. For you, your diagnosis or treatment may have you questioning many aspects of your life and the direction you are headed. You can process the reasons why today did not go as planned and create a new strategy for tomorrow. Without goals, you become at risk for getting stuck and being stagnant. Accomplishing goals gives you a sense of purpose and direction that make life more satisfying.How to JournalBeginning something is much different than being consistent with it. To make journaling successful, treat it like exercise. Going from no exercise to constant exercise is too taxing on your body and your mind. Ease yourself into journaling by experimenting a few times a week. Limit yourself to 10 – 15 minutes a day until you develop a level of comfort.When and where you journal has a strong bearing on success. Try to journal at night in an attempt to reflect on the day, but be flexible if this does not work for you. The bedroom seems like the natural spot to journal if there is enough privacy for you. If not, look elsewhere like outside, the bathroom or in the attic. There is no wrong time to journal or wrong place to do it.Your method of journaling has many options as well. Many opt for the simplicity of pen and paper, but don’t shy away from some 21st century options. Writing on a computer or tablet can assist in the flow of material from your fingers to the screen, while locking it away in a text document can ensure that no one ever finds it. You can even choose to forgo letters and words altogether by using art to convey your thoughts and feelings.Some people think that sharing their thoughts with the world via blog or social media is the best thing to do. Surely, communicating yourself to a large group has many pluses, but for journal writing, keep it confidential. The knowledge that people my read your writing changes the content in undesirable ways. You want the words to flow from you without any filters that comes from worry about the perceptions of others.The truth is that journaling can be whatever you want it to be. As long as you do it with consistency and you find ways to gain from it, the process is worthwhile. Avoid thoughts of beginning your journal when life settles down. When life if crazy, hectic and confusing, you need journaling the most. Adding another coping skill is always a good idea.Today, turn an ordinary notebook into an extraordinary journal.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer TreatmentsThe Latest in Cancer Treatment: Proton Beam TherapyCancer AwarenessWhat Are the Different Types of Skin Cancer?Cancer AwarenessWhat Causes Cancer?Cancer Awareness8 Things Every Man Should Know About Prostate CancerCancer AwarenessRisk Factors and Causes of Hodgkin LymphomaCancer SymptomsEight Signs of Leukemia You Should Not Ignoreyou may also likeLiving With CancerYour Diet and CancerLiving With CancerUnderstanding the Stages of CancerLiving With CancerThe Power of Essential Oils for Cancer PatientsLiving With CancerCoping with Cancerconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

They will readily process and accept the information about the condition, the prognosis, and the treatment without any ill effects or significant impact on their life.The days after their diagnosis will look remarkably like the days prior to their diagnosis as they do well mentally and physically. These people will be the small minority of all people with a cancer diagnosis.The vast majority of people will experience a monumental shift in their mental and physical functioning, and for good reason: cancer creates effects on your body that are direct and negative. The treatments can do the same as they often result in weakness, fatigue, clouded thinking, and nausea.The unwanted impacts don’t end there, though. As people deal with the negative consequences to their physical functioning, they are confronted with massive amounts of stress and tension due to the indirect effects of cancer.A cancer diagnosis carries huge amounts of emotional weight. Everyone seems to know a life that has been affected by cancer. First-hand or by word of mouth, they have noted the destruction done, and it’s scary.Fear, stress, and tension grow like weeds in a garden. They may start out as small and manageable, but as time goes on, it becomes more time consuming and complicated to pull them out.If positive supports and optimism are the flowers and vegetables you intended to grow in your garden, the weeds will push them out. Before long, your garden will be full only of weeds.Depression as a WeedDepression in people with cancer is quite common and very understandable. As many as 25 percent of all people with cancer will develop a type of depression, but it can be hard to diagnosis.Symptoms of depression include:Low mood or irritabilityLow motivationLow energyChanged sleepWeight lossIncreased feelings of worthlessness or guiltThoughts of deathProblems with concentration and making choicesWhile looking at the list, it is easy to see how cancer and cancer treatments may overlap with symptoms of depression, but depression will be longer lasting, more intense, and more pervasive than feelings of sadness. If the feelings are present more often than not for two weeks, it could likely be depression.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungNew Liver Cancer TreatmentsKidney Cancer MedicationsKidney Cancers Treatments You May Also LikeFeeling the Fear of CancerLiving With CancerFeeling the Fear of Cancer8 years ago| by Eric PattersonSome of the fear of cancer and related feelings will be short-lived as they alleviate over time, but others will only intensify.Anxiety as a WeedDepression is not the only outcome of these weeds in your garden. Anxiety is another option, and it can present as a low-grade, ever-present anxiety, an intense but fleeting anxiety, and variations between.The ever-present version is called generalized anxiety, with symptoms like:Intense and excessive worryFeeling restlessProblems with focusBeing irritablePoor sleepFeeling physically tense and unable to relaxPeople with a cancer diagnosis might spend huge amounts of time worrying about their future, their ability to continue working, their children, and other stressors. This worry can consume aspects of their life and lessen their ability to function as high levels.The intense periods of anxiety may develop into panic attacks. Panic attacks are periods of high anxiety that last for less than 10 minutes usually. They will be marked by:Pounding heartShortness of breath or feelings of chokingBeing lightheaded, numb, or dizzyFeeling very hot or coldFear that you are dying or losing control of yourselfThese panic attacks can occur with or without the generalized anxiety. Additionally, it is possible that a person dealing with cancer can have depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.Pulling the WeedsIt may seem like depression, anxiety, and panic are too many obstacles to overcome — too many weeds to pull. The task might seem daunting, but taking care of your mental health will leave you with more resources to care for your physical health. If your physical health can improve, the weeds might not grow back.When beginning the process of cleaning out the garden, it will be essential to use your time and energy wisely as they are in limited supply. Avoiding negative coping skills that seem positive will be a good starting point.If you don’t want to add to your stress, stop:Ignoring the problem, hoping it will go away. Higher levels of stress rarely alleviate without work.Lying to others by telling them you are okay. It is not fair to them or you.Believing what you feel is bad or wrong. It is not a failure on your part that you are experiencing these symptoms.Relying on alcohol or other drugs to reduce your symptoms. Self-medication never improves symptoms — it only adds more problems.Thinking things will never get better. Pessimism only makes situations seem worse.Avoiding the negatives will help with you depression, anxiety, and panic, but to get the kind of success you are looking for, you must take active steps. If you want to reduce your stress, start:Setting aside time each day to think about your thoughts, pay attention to your feelings, and observe your behaviors. Even if the results are uncomfortable, they will move you forward.Talking to trusted friends, family members, and coworkers about how you feel and what you are thinking. Seek out those with a good history of being nonjudgmental to have your feelings validated.Balancing time alone with time with others. Being alone is necessary at times, especially when enduring a cancer diagnosis — but too much can be lonely and isolating.Focusing on your physical health. When illnesses develop, some people stop tending to their needs out of frustration. Eating well, sleeping well, and exercising to your ability will remain important throughout your diagnosis and treatment.Attending therapy. Issues of depression, anxiety, and panic can be too overwhelming and confusion to tackle alone. A therapist can help accomplish the above tips more effectively.Cancer is going to exert its will over you as it affects your physical and mental health. Understanding the impact, what can hurt your prospects, and what can help will allow you to maintain your well-being and courage to move forward.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer AwarenessTrue or False: Are All Tumors Cancerous?Cancer AwarenessAre Cysts Cancerous or Not?Cancer PreventionHow to Prevent Cervical CancerCancer AwarenessWhat You Should Know About Cancer in ChildrenCancer AwarenessEverything You Need to Know About Oral CancerCancer TreatmentsUnderstanding How Radiation Therapy Worksyou may also likeLiving With Cancer8 Movies About Cancer You Need to SeeLiving With CancerEnjoying the Holidays Despite a Cancer DiagnosisLiving With CancerCoping With Nausea and CancerLiving With CancerHow and Why to Raise Cancer Awarenessconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Pancreatic cancer accounts for 3 percent of the of all cancers and 7 percent of cancer mortality.This particular cancer has claimed the lives of numerous famous names, including Steve Jobs and Patrick Swayze.Pancreatic cancer often goes undetected until it is in an advanced stage when is too difficult to treat. Unfortunately, most of the time, symptoms only develop after the cancer has spread.Signs and SymptomsMost people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are already at a late stage by the time the disease is detected, and by that point, the prognosis could mean death for some people.While there are early signs, these often go undetected because they could mean anything. But if you find you are experiencing two or more early warning signs, call your doctor and ask for testing.Some of the early warning signs of pancreatic cancer are listed below.Diabetes That Suddenly Comes OnDiabetes is either a symptom of pancreatic cancer or a risk factor. People have had diabetes for a long time have a higher chance of developing this type of cancer.In individuals who have had diabetes for shorter periods, the research is unclear as to whether diabetes contributed to cancer or whether pre-cancer cells caused diabetes.New onset diabetes may be any early symptom of pancreatic cancer in people over 50, this according to a 2009 report in the journal, The Lancet Oncology. A sudden change in blood sugar in people with diabetes that was previously well-controlled is also a sign of pancreatic cancer.JaundiceJaundice, the yellowing of skin and eyes, is common in people with pancreatic cancer. It is due to excess bilirubin – a bile compound – in the blood.Tumors at the top of the pancreas case the bile duct to narrow and block the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the small intestine. That blockage is what causes the buildup of bilirubin.Signs of jaundice are:Skin irritation and itchinessDark urineLight or clay color stoolsA surgical procedure called a biliary bypass can clear the blocked bile duct. Another treatment option for jaundice involves insertion of a stent to open and keep the bile duct open.Abnormal BloatingBloating in pancreatic cancer is the result of the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, a condition called ascites. That extra fluid is what causes the abdominal bloating.In addition to bloating, ascites can cause other symptoms may include:Breathing difficultiesAbdominal pain and pressureWeight gainDigestive issues, including nausea, ingestion, and constipationFatigueAnkle swellingThe most effective treatment for ascites is a treatment of the tumor with chemotherapy or surgery. Diuretics (water pill) can help to slow down the buildup because they cause the kidneys to expel more water into the urine.In very severe cases, the fluid is drained by inserting a needle into the abdominal cavity and slowly draining the fluid. This treatment helps temporarily, but the excess fluid will return.Enlarged GallbladderIf a tumor is blocking the bile duct and causing build up to the gallbladder, the gallbladder can become enlarged. A doctor can feel this enlargement as a large lump on the right side of the rib cage. This can also be seen on an imaging test, such as at CT scan.Pancreatic cancer can also cause the liver to become enlarged. But this usually more frequent if the cancer has spread to the liver.Related Search Topics New Cancer Treatments LungNew Liver Cancer TreatmentsLung Cancer Treatments Treat Advanced Prostate Cancer You May Also Like11 Symptoms of Liver Cancer You Shouldn’t IgnoreCancer Symptoms11 Symptoms of Liver Cancer You Shouldn’t Ignore5 years ago| by Katrina HodginsRecognizing the symptoms of liver cancer may help you recognize that it’s time to see a doctor. Learn about liver cancer symptoms here.PainPain results when tumors invade the nerves. With pancreatic cancer, pain is often felt in the stomach or the back.This type of pain worsens with eating, laying down and bending forward. Pain is more common when the cancer is in the main body or the bottom part of the pancreas.Your abdomen may be tender or painful if your liver, gallbladder or pancreases are enlarged and/or inflamed.FatigueCancer fatigue is not just simply being tired. It is extreme exhaustion on an almost daily basis.Sometimes, cancer fatigue comes on suddenly and for no reason. This type of fatigue makes you weak, causes sleep problems and makes it difficult to concentrate.Fatigue it is also caused by cancer treatments. It may get worse during treatment and may go on long after treatment has completed.Your doctor can help you to find the best ways to manage fatigue. But he or she cannot help if you do not disclose your fatigue struggles and how they are affecting you daily.Digestive ProblemsDigestive issues associated with pancreatic cancer include:Nausea and vomitingWeight lossLoss of appetiteChanges to tasteThe cause of nausea and vomiting is usually a blocked duodenum. The duodenum is the upper part of the small intestine.Weight loss results from loss of appetite and malabsorption of fats due to a reduced supply of pancreatic enzymes. Changes to taste have also been noted in people with pancreatic cancer.Unusual StoolsPancreatic tumors keep digestive enzymes from reaching the intestine resulting in the ability to digest fatty foods. Stools become loose, smelly and float because of this excessive fat.Bleeding in the upper intestines may cause dark, tar-like stools.Unusual stools are usually the first signs of pancreatic cancer, but this is also the most overlooked symptom.What to Do If You Experience These Symptoms?The symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often mistaken for more common and less severe conditions. Therefore, it is important to document all symptoms and report them to your doctor.If your doctor thinks your concerns are real and concerning, he or she will order imaging tests and blood work.It is possible you may have to convince your doctor that your concerns are legitimate. If he or she is not willing to listen, find a doctor who will, but most doctors will do what the patient asks.Plenty of people still living productive lives due to the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at an early stage. Don’t push your health concerns aside and don’t let anyone else do that either, including medical professionals.ResourcesAmerican Cancer Society (Key Statistics for Pancreatic Cancer)American Cancer Society (Signs and Symptoms of Pancreatic Cancer)National Institutes of Health (New-onset Diabetes: A Potential Clue to the Early Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer)Mayo Clinic (Pancreatic Cancer: Signs and Symptoms)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsCancer AwarenessAre Skin Tags a Sign of Skin Cancer?Living With CancerCoping with CancerCancer AwarenessWhat You Should Know About Cancer in ChildrenCancer TreatmentsWhat are White Blood Cell Boosters?Living With Cancer10 Cancer Terms You Should KnowCancer TreatmentsWhat to Expect from Breast Cancer Surgeryyou may also likeCancer SymptomsThe Silent Nine Signs of a Brain TumorCancer SymptomsUnderstanding Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma: Are You at Risk?Cancer SymptomsBreast Cancer Symptoms and Warning SignsCancer SymptomsThe Causes, Signs and Symptoms of Mesotheliomaconnect with usPrivacy PolicyOur TeamTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsCancerLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

FibromyalgiaLiving.todayMenuFibro FactsFibro LivingBlogSearchSearch HRT can help to reduce hot flashes, improve sleep and regulate your mood. Can Hormone Replacement Therapy Help with Fibromyalgia?FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail4 years ago| by Natalie Saunders Fibromyalgia and Hormone Replacement TherapyFibromyalgia affects far more women than men. This fact has led many people to wonder whether hormones play a part in the development of this painful condition. If so, it seems logical that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) could help, but is there any truth to this theory?In this article we look at the relationship between fibromyalgia and hormones, and whether HRT could help.Can Hormone Replacement Therapy Help Fibromyalgia?As many as 80-90% of people with fibromyalgia are women. Furthermore, the condition is often diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 50, a period which coincides with the onset of menopause.Many of the symptoms of fibromyalgia are also similar to those of the menopause. These symptoms include:Stiffness, aches and painsPoor sleepDaytime fatigueMood changesDifficulty with concentration and memoryThis has led many people to speculate that hormonal changes could play a role in the development of fibromyalgia. It has also led scientists to wonder whether HRT could help.The current evidence for using HRT to treat fibromyalgia is inconclusive. One study found that treatment with estrogen-based HRT did not lead to any improvements in fibromyalgia pain. However, the authors state that HRT could help with other symptoms such as sleep, vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot flashes), mood and overall quality of life.Another study found that hormonal treatment does offer pain relief to fibromyalgia patients. However, the hormone used in the study was testosterone rather than estrogen. The study found that using testosterone as a gel significantly reduced pain and the sensitivity of tender points.To explain the results of these two studies, let’s look at the link between hormones and fibromyalgia.The Relationship between Hormones and FibromyalgiaIt is still unclear why some people develop fibromyalgia, but it is thought to be due to an imbalance in the body’s pain processing system. Pain is controlled by a complex interaction between nerve cells, hormones and other chemicals. If any of these factors is thrown out of harmony, pain can occur.In terms of hormones, it seems that testosterone and progesterone have the most significant impact on pain. Increased levels of both of these hormones are associated with decreases in pain. Estrogen appears to play a less significant role. However, estrogen does have a close relationship with serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is often decreased in fibromyalgia patients.The exact relationship between hormones and fibromyalgia is yet to be fully established. However, what we do know is that men with the condition tend to report less pain than women, suggesting that hormones do play a role.It also seems that fibromyalgia may make menopausal symptoms worse. One study found that of the post-menopausal women who experienced symptoms, 29% were also diagnosed with fibromyalgia. In comparison, only 4% of the women without symptoms had a fibromyalgia diagnosis.Fibromyalgia and Hormone Replacement Therapy BenefitsThere are many different types of HRT. Some contain estrogen alone while others contain estrogen combined with progesterone. These medications are available as tablets, patches, or topical creams and gels.Related Search Topics Fibromyalgia Migraine HeadacheChronic Migraine FibromyalgiaFibro Headache TreatmentsThe Cost Of Botox Fibro You May Also LikeThe Condition No One UnderstandsBlogThe Condition No One Understands9 years ago| by Sarah BorienI’m not sure what I find hardest; the constant pain, fatigue and myriad of symptoms that come with fibro, or the constant need to explain and justify it.Although research suggests that estrogen-based HRT probably does not help with fibromyalgia pain, it could still have several benefits. HRT can help to reduce hot flashes, improve sleep and regulate your mood.If you are suffering from fibromyalgia, the last thing you need is menopause symptoms on top, so this could be a real plus. Women who take HRT may also experience improvements in their energy levels and sex drive.Another benefit of HRT is that it could help reduce the risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. These conditions are more common after menopause due to decreases in estrogen levels. However, these benefits need to weighed carefully against the risks.Fibromyalgia and Hormone Replacement Therapy RisksThere are certain risks associated with taking HRT, especially if you take it for a long time. Women who take HRT for longer than a year may have an increased risk of breast cancer, and possibly a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer.Estrogen-only HRT is associated with an increased risk of uterine (womb) cancer, although combined HRT reduces this risk. Therefore, medication containing both estrogen and progesterone is usually recommended, unless you have had a hysterectomy.Another possible risk of HRT is an increased chance of developing blood clots. However, menopausal women are at very low risk of this problem, so it is not considered a major concern.Finally, estrogen-only HRT can slightly increase the risk of having a stroke, but again, the risk is still relatively low.Aside from these risks, taking HRT can cause several other side effects. Although most of these are not serious, they can be annoying nonetheless.The side effects of HRT include:BloatingBreast tendernessNauseaLeg crampsHeadaches and migrainesIndigestionVaginal bleedingMood swings or depressionThese side effects will vary depending on which type of HRT you take. They are less likely to occur if you use patches or topical creams.Fibromyalgia and Hormone Replacement Therapy: The Bottom LineIf you are thinking about using HRT to treat fibromyalgia, you will need to decide whether the potential benefits outweigh the risks. You also need to consider which symptoms you are hoping to relieve.If you want to treat your sleep, anxiety or menopausal symptoms, HRT could help. However, if you are looking for pain relief, other medications may be more beneficial. Discuss the options with your physician to try and find the most appropriate therapy for you.ResourcesNHS (Hormone Replacement Therapy)NCBI (Effect of Estrogen-Serotonin Interactions on Mood and Cognition)Australian Menopause Society (Fibromyalgia and Menopause: Any Link?)Healthline (Treatment for Fibromyalgia)NCBI (Daily Fluctuations of Progesterone and Testosterone are Associated with Fibromyalgia Pain Severity) Health Rising (Sex (Hormones) and Fibromyalgia: The Pain Connection)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsFibro Facts9 Common Symptoms of FibromyalgiaFibro LivingFind Fibromyalgia Pain Relief With These Eight OptionsFibro LivingCan CBD Oil Help Relieve Fibromyalgia Pain?Fibro FactsCan You Receive Disability Benefits with Fibromyalgia?Fibro FactsBreaking the Fibromyalgia MythFibro LivingParenting With Fibromyalgiayou may also likeBlogWhat’s the Connection Between Fibromyalgia and Arthritis?BlogIs There a Link between Arthritis and Fibromyalgia?BlogHow a Therapist Can Help With FibroBlogWhy You Need a Strong Support System With Fibromyalgiaconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsFibromyalgiaLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

It’s not a big deal for most people; you disinfect, slap on a bandage and keep going about your day. Small injuries are a minor inconvenience because your blood will clot and scab over pretty quickly—unless you have ITP. In this article we explain what ITP is, what the common symptoms are, and we also review ITP treatment.What Is ITP?Immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease that targets your blood platelets—the cells that clump together to help your blood clot. The immune system marks the platelets as foreign invaders and they are eliminated by the spleen (sometimes the liver helps out too). There are some cases where platelet production is impaired in addition to the platelets being destroyed, causing the platelet count to plummet. ITP can lead to bruising and bleeding that happens easily and excessively because there are not enough platelets available to slow the bleeding.How Many Platelets Should You Have?Platelets (also known as thrombocytes) are colorless, disc-shaped cells in our blood that help in blood clotting and aid in the structure of blood vessel walls. A normal platelet count ranges from about 140,000 to 440,000 per microliter of blood. A patient is considered to have low platelets if they have less than 140,000. ITP is an unusually lower number of platelets; less than 100,000 might be considered ITP, but the condition needs to be diagnosed by a doctor.Causes of ITPAs an autoimmune disease, ITP occurs when the immune system incorrectly identifies platelets as an invader, causing it to attack these blood cells. ITP is not a genetic disease; if a family member has ITP, your risk of getting ITP does not increase. It appears that ITP is generally triggered by another infection:In children, it usually occurs after a viral illness, such as the flu.In adults, it may be triggered by an infection with HIV, hepatitis, or H. pylori.As far as risk groups, ITP is more common with young women. Risk seems to increase with individuals who have other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome.Symptoms of ITPDepending on the severity of ITP, symptoms may look like:Spontaneous or excessive bruisingPinpoint-sized dots that are red-purple in color and look like a rashBleeding from the gums or noseBlood in urine or stoolsUnusually heavy menstrual flowBlood blisters on the inside of the cheeksThe Difference of ITP in Children and AdultsChildren who get ITP generally make a full recovery without treatment. The reason this happens is because their bodies usually stop making the antibodies that attack the platelets, so the condition resolves on its own. In adults, the prognosis is different since ITP in adulthood is often long term, requiring a treatment plan to be manageable.What to Do When a Child Has ITPChildren’s bodies usually self-correct over time and their bodies stop producing the platelet antibodies. In the meantime, the goal of treatment in children is to keep their platelets in a safe range until these antibodies disappear. While children generally do not require treatment, you need to take some precautions to try and prevent injuries and bleeding. There are some tips that can help manage the condition:Keeping your doctor informed of your child’s condition and discuss any limitations or recommended safety measures.Making sure that the environment is safe by padding areas or having your child wear protective clothing and gear.Restricting certain activities that pose danger, including contact sports.Being informed of all your child’s medication. Some medication, including over the counter medicine, may affect the body’s ability to control bleeding. If you are unsure of any consequences of medication, speak with a pharmacist or doctor.Related Search Topics Arthritis Pain ReliefDiabetes Type 2 SymptomsShingles SymptomsLiver Cancer Facts You May Also LikeEight Medicinal Benefits of CBD OilAll AgesEight Medicinal Benefits of CBD Oil5 years ago| by Natalie SaundersIn recent years, CBD oil has grown in popularity as it has a whole host of health benefits. Here are eight CBD oil benefits to be aware of.How to Treat ITPThere is not a cure for ITP, but following a doctor-recommended treatment plan usually improves blood platelet count. Treatments vary depending on your platelet count and personal health status.Regular Monitoring and Platelet ChecksIn mild cases, it is just a matter of making sure your numbers and general health are in good working order. Ongoing check-ins help ensure that your ITP is under control.Platelet-boosting MedicationsThere are a variety of drugs that your doctor may recommend. Usually an oral corticosteroid helps improve your platelet count by slowing the rate of platelet destruction, but steroids are not recommended for long-term use. Your doctor may give an injection of immune globulin, or prescribe other drugs, such as romiplostim and eltrombopag to assist the bone marrow in platelet production.SplenectomyThis is a surgery to remove the spleen. The spleen destroys blood platelets in the body, so getting rid of this organ should improve your platelet count. Unfortunately, a splenectomy is not a guaranteed fix and there are other side effects, such as permanently making your body more susceptible to infection.Platelet Concentrate TransfusionIn cases where emergency treatment is needed and platelet levels crash, you may require a platelet transfusion. Platelets are given by infusion into a vein and the process takes less than a half hour, offering an increase of platelets right away.Hormone TherapyIn some cases of low platelets, doctors may prescribe hormones to teenage girls to stop their menstrual cycle. They do this because additional bleeding from menstruation may lower the platelet count in some patients.Some Warnings for People with ITPThere are a few tips for those who have ITP and how they need to protect themselves, including:Avoiding contact sports or other high-impact activities that may cause bleeding in the brain.Keeping an eye out for signs of infection following a splenectomy.Advising your doctor of any medications you are taking. Some non-prescription drugs may affect platelet function.Talk to Your DoctorITP can cause some pretty serious health issues if not treated. Make sure your platelet count is in a safe zone and see your doctor as often as required to keep the impact of ITP to a minimum.ResourcesStanford Health Care (Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP))Platelet Disorder Support Association (ITP Frequently Asked Questions)Mayo Clinic (Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP))MacMillan Cancer Support (Platelet Transfusions)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsTwenty-SomethingTake Care of New Nose Piercings to Avoid InfectionsEmpty NesterTop 10 Treatment Options for TendonitisSandwich GenerationNatural Remedies to Stop SweatingGolden YearsWhat Is COPD?Twenty-Something2 Types of Locked Knees and How to Treat ThemSandwich Generation8 Signs of an Ovarian Cystyou may also likeAll AgesHow to Treat Bipolar DisorderAll AgesBad Body Odor: Causes and Ways to Fight BackAll Ages4 Causes of Tailbone Pain — and What You Can Do About ItAll AgesWhy Am I Always Hungry?connect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsOur TeamContact UsHealthLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

While anxiety itself can be a normal part of life, it becomes an issue when it interferes with your ability to participate in regular activities. Understanding the link between anxiety and depression, as well as learning about the natural remedies to help you cope, can go a long way towards preserving your way of life. So, let’s take look at what your options are for natural remedies for anxiety and depression.What Are Anxiety and Depression?Anxiety is actually a normal part of life. If you have ever been particularly worried or stressed at a particular event, such as presenting to a large crowd, then you were most likely experiencing anxiety. However, anxiety can become a more significant issue if you do not find ways to cope with it. When anxiety becomes a concern, you may have the following symptoms:RestlessnessInability to concentratePanic attacksExcessive worrySweatingNervousnessDepression differs from anxiety but can develop with anxiety if it remains untreated. Depression can present itself in a variety of ways that include both physical and emotional symptoms. Essentially, depression is an overwhelming sense of sadness and hopelessness that makes it difficult to function in everyday life. Common symptoms include:SadnessChanges in sleep patternsFeeling worthlessChanges in appetiteLoss of interest in regular activitiesTypes of Natural Remedies for Anxiety and DepressionFortunately, there are a number of ways to treat both anxiety and depression. While some people may require medication or cognitive therapy, there are natural remedies that may also help.Create a ScheduleWhen anxiety and depression creep into your life, it can become very easy to waste away an entire day. Because your mind may be racing or creating a false narrative about yourself, it is always a good idea to create a schedule and routine.It may be as easy as mapping out your morning with a few simple tasks such as getting out of bed, showering and making breakfast. Setting up a schedule for yourself can help you stay on task rather than spending your days idle. Sometimes, a little bit of activity is what you need to help break up some of those anxious or negative thoughts.Maintain Proper Diet and ExerciseWhile there is no one diet or exercise routine that will cure anxiety and depression, research does show that they can both help relieve symptoms. Proper nutrition and adequate movement can go a long way toward ensuring that your body is being taken care of first and foremost.Related Search Topics What Is Kidney CancerWeight Loss Diet PlanTreatment For HerpesTreatments for Depression You May Also LikeSigns, Symptoms, and Treatment Options for BulimiaTwenty-SomethingSigns, Symptoms, and Treatment Options for Bulimia5 years ago| by Natalie SaundersBulimia nervosa is an eating disorder which is characterized by binge eating and purging. Read on to learn about bulimia signs and treatment options here.Set GoalsSetting goals can be a positive influence on your life. That said, your goals do not have to be long-term or grand. In fact, it is a good idea to start with smaller goals that are easily achievable. The idea here is that achieving a goal will help you get into a more positive mindset, and then you can build from that momentum. The goal can be as simple as making the decision to get out of your pajamas or maybe finishing a homework assignment.Have a Proper Sleep ScheduleNever underestimate the value of proper rest. Lack of sleep can make it incredibly difficult to fight the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Ensure that you are getting plenty of rest so that your mind is capable of battling some of those negative thoughts and feelings. Most adults should have eight hours of sleep per night. If you are sleeping much less or way more than this, then this may be a problem. Track your sleep schedule to learn more about your sleeping patterns.Get Out of Your Comfort ZoneWe all have comfort zones that include people we know, activities we do regularly and a host of other factors that we are familiar with. However, sometimes, comfort zones can hold you back. If you want to mix things up a little bit, try meeting new people, try new things, or travel somewhere you have never been before. This slight change in your life can lead to big rewards. It has the potential to transform how you think and could have a positive influence that you need to tackle anxiety and depression.An OverviewAnxiety and depression are both serious mental health concerns. While there are a number of natural remedies that may work, there are no one-size-fits-all approach to tackling these issues. If you have already tried a few things listed here, then you may want to consult with your doctor to learn more about your options.The solution for anxiety and depression can be just as unique as the person who lives with it. Understanding the resources that are available to you can go a long way to helping you overcome these issues and live a happier and fuller life. If you suspect that you are living with anxiety and depression, then consult your doctor to learn more about your customized treatment plan.ResourcesAnxiety and Depression Association of America (Depression)American Psychiatric Association (What Is Depression?)WebMD (10 Natural Depression Treatments)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsAll AgesAll You Need To Know About Breast HealthAll AgesIs Bottled Water Better for You?Sandwich GenerationWhat to Expect from In Vitro FertilizationSandwich GenerationIs It Possible for Children to Have Bipolar Disorder?All AgesWhat Is Circadian Rhythm and How Can It Impact Mood?Empty NesterWhat All Women Need to Know About Vaginal Atrophyyou may also likeTwenty-SomethingHow Is HIV Diagnosed?Twenty-SomethingHow to Enhance your Breasts NaturallyTwenty-SomethingWhy Is My Baby Crying so Much?Twenty-SomethingWhat to Expect from Cosmetic Breast Surgeryconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsOur TeamContact UsHealthLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Today, people can do their taxes, order a pizza, fall in love and buy a car, so it only seems natural that they can get therapy online, too.Online counselling is not necessarily new, but it is increasing in popularity, which leads to a number of changes with services shifting to keep up with demand. Although online counseling may not be right for everyone, for some it could be a much-needed support to improve their mental health and overall well-being.Online Counselling BasicsPeople new to the concept of online counselling may have a single notion of the practice and what it entails. In reality, online counselling covers a broad variety of services.Available versions of online therapy include:Text message therapy where a therapist in exchanging text messages with the clientPhone therapy with the individual speaking to a therapist over the phoneE-mail therapy with the therapist and client e-mailing each other at scheduled intervals or as needed based on symptomsVideo chatting through web-based apps like FaceTime or SkypeSome forms of online counselling will subscribe to only one of these services while others will employ all of the above to provide the most comprehensive care. The available communication methods will vary based on factors including the location of services, insurance payment and therapist preference.The idea of getting therapy at a distance is not new. For more than 20 years, the practice, sometimes referred to as telepsychology, has existed, but as smartphones became more capable, there was a higher demand for this form of therapy.The Benefits of Online CounsellingWhen it comes to online counselling, convenience is by far the most obvious benefit of the service. People have busy, over-scheduled lives, so having the ability to check in with a therapist during a free moment is fantastic. Before your morning coffee or after the kids are sleeping at night, you can have therapy from the comfort of your own home.After convenience, many people see privacy as a major benefit of online counselling. In the real world, a person must physically go into a building or therapist’s office to receive treatment, which could lead to embarrassment or awkward situations if you see someone you know.With online counselling, you barely have to leave your house. The added convenience and privacy are valuable because they lower the barriers of access to counseling. Some people who have intense symptoms or pervasive disorders may avoid treatment, but online counselling creates ease around the process.Another benefit is having access to a broader range of therapists with online counselling. Depending on your location, you may only have access to a handful of professionals, but with the internet, you can connect with therapists from every corner of the country.Related Search Topics Symptoms of Ovarian CancerWhat Is Kidney CancerWhat Is Liver CancerArthritis Pain Relief You May Also LikeHow Do I Know If I Have Kidney Stones?All AgesHow Do I Know If I Have Kidney Stones?8 years ago| by Angie FinlayIf you suspect you might have kidney stones, compare your symptoms to the classic warning signs and symptoms that typically occur.Problems and Risk Factors of Online CounsellingMany people find counselling to be an intimate experience between two people sitting face to face. Online counselling strips away much of the intimacy connected to the therapeutic process, as the counselor and client may never see each other.In some cases, this separation will have little effect on the therapy process, but in other situations, a therapist can gain tremendous insights by being in the same room with the client to observe how they look, interact with others and experience the world. Without direct contact, the therapy could be less effective.Another problem with online counseling involves the credentials of the therapist. Reliable sites will vet each professional to track their competency and try to reduce risk, but you may not actually know who you are communicating with or what their background is.Some other risks of online counseling include:Greater chance of miscommunicationThe increased likelihood of being distracted during sessionsThe challenging nature of trying to express feelings in wordsPotential lack of insurance coveragePotential privacy and confidentiality issues with unprotected servers or connected devicesIs Online Therapy Right for You?With a simple online search, a person can find plenty of online counselling options, but are any of these right for you? The answer really depends on your expectations and symptoms.People who may benefit from online counseling are people who:Are interested in entering treatment for the first timeHave had negative experiences with therapy in the pastHave mild mental health symptomsDo not need medications or are getting medications from another providerPeople who should avoid online counseling options include:Those with complex mental health, physical health and substance use disordersPeople with a history of self-injury, suicidal, or homicidal behaviorsThose who find it difficult to be honest with their therapistPeople who need to be connected to higher levels of care within their communityWith mental health services, no one treatment works for all people. Instead, people need to experiment with various options to find one that fits their needs. With a little open-mindedness and patience, online counseling could be best treatment option for you.ResourcesAmerican Psychological Association (A Growing Wave of Online Therapy)American Psychological Association (What You Need to Know Before Choosing Online Therapy)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsGolden YearsWhat Happens When You Have Coronary Artery Disease?Empty NesterWhat Are the 4 Types of Pneumonia?Empty NesterDo You Suffer From Brain Fog?Twenty-SomethingSigns that Point Towards Bacterial Vaginosis and How to Treat ItSandwich GenerationIs It Better to Breastfeed or Bottle Feed?Sandwich GenerationUnderstanding Eczema in Children and How to Treat Ityou may also likeAll AgesSix Anaphylaxis Symptoms You Shouldn’t IgnoreAll AgesNine Signs That Point to a Pink Eye InfectionAll AgesReducing Blue Light in Your Life Can Have Great BenefitsAll Ages8 Hair Removal Mistakes to Avoidconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsOur TeamContact UsHealthLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Don’t Ignore These Subtle Heart Attack SignsFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail6 years ago| by Katrina Hodgins Signs of a Heart AttackAs you get older, you start to recognize that health, especially heart health, isn’t a guarantee. You become more aware of certain conditions and ailments and perhaps you wonder if you are at risk for a heart condition.If any pain occurs in your chest, your first instinct might be to assume that the pain is a heart attack, but what are the signs of a heart attack, and what should you do if it is one?What Happens During a Heart Attack?A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, happens when one or more of your coronary arteries become obstructed.When a roadblock pops up in your arteries, it causes an issue because there is no other route for oxygenated blood to get to the heart. Without this oxygen, the heart is unable to work properly, so it starts to shut down.Much like the brain, the longer the heart goes without oxygen, the worse the damage gets. Treatment needs to be immediate, otherwise, portions of the heart muscle begin to die. The damage spectrum ranges from mild to severe and heart attack damage isn’t an isolated incident – even a minor heart attack will affect you for the rest of your life.The Danger of Plaque BuildupYou may question what causes this blockage in the arteries. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation, more than 9 out of 10 heart attacks are caused by atherosclerosis. This is the buildup of waxy plaque on the interior wall of an artery over time.Plaque buildups are essentially deposits made of cholesterol, fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium, and a clotting material in the blood known as fibrin. The thicker the plaque buildup gets, the narrower the passage becomes for blood transportation.It would be like starting out with a spacious four-lane highway and changing it down to one lane. The buildup results in a blood clot which can become so large it obstructs the flow of blood to the heart. Atherosclerosis occurs over the course of many years.An area of plaque buildup can break open and cause a blood clot to form on the plaque’s surface, either completely or partially blocking blood flow.Heart Attack Risk FactorsThe makeup of plaque probably gives a pretty good idea for some of those at risk for a heart attack. If you suffer from any of the following, you need to start making your heart health a bigger priority:High blood pressureHigh blood cholesterolBeing overweight/obesityAn unhealthy dietLack of physical activityHigh blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetesSmoking also helps accelerate the plaque buildup and cause it to grow biggerOther factors are age – risk increases for men after 45 and women after 55, if there is a family history of heart disease, or preeclampsia (a condition that can develop during pregnancy where you see a rise in blood pressure or excess protein in the urine).Related Search Topics Symptoms of Ovarian CancerWhat Is Liver CancerTreatment For HerpesTreatments for Depression You May Also Like5 Types of Insoles to Get You Back on Your FeetEmpty Nester5 Types of Insoles to Get You Back on Your Feet4 years ago| by Shaina McQuilkieFlat feet syndrome can cause foot and hip pain. Insoles for flat feet can help these symptoms. Find out if insoles are the right treatment option for you.Heart Attack SymptomsHeed the warning from any heart attack symptoms. Symptoms range from mild to severe pain and anywhere from one symptom to several.The most common symptom is pressure, pain, or discomfort in the chest. Your chest may feel full, heavy, or have a burning sensation. There may be other aching sensations present in your upper body, most likely the neck, jaw, shoulders, arms, and back.Other symptoms include shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sweating, or nausea. Women and men perceive the signs differently, as women are more apt to cite other signs such as anxiety, indigestion, or back pain as one of the first signs.What to Do During a Heart AttackIf an attack happens to you, get somebody to call 9-1-1 immediately. It is recommended that you stop any activity and either sit or lie down depending on which is most comfortable for you.During a heart attack, you will still be responsive; the heart still beats, and blood still circulates so CPR is not required. It is a different story if the heart attack leads to cardiac arrest (the heart stops beating, and blood doesn’t circulate).Chew and swallow aspirin (unless you’re allergic), as aspirin helps protect against heart attack and eases pain and inflammation. It is not recommended that you take acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Taking aspirin can break up the blood clot causing the heart attack. Aspirin should not be taken in lieu of proper medical care.If you are having a heart attack, you will want a proper diagnosis and medical direction on how to take care of your heart going forward. What you think is a heart attack may also be a symptom of another ailment such as angina or anxiety. No matter what, get yourself checked out.How to Prevent a Heart AttackIn order to protect your heart, you need to lower your risk factors to help prevent a heart attack. Be heart-smart and alter your lifestyle.Commit to eating healthier, engaging in physical activity on a consistent basis, giving up vices such as smoking, getting your stress under control, and managing your weight. Be sure to treat related conditions such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease and peripheral artery disease.Your heart doesn’t operate by itself; it has a team of factors which add to its health or detriment.Here’s a little food for thought: Keep a list of your medications and allergies in your wallet – it is beneficial to medical personnel in the event of an emergency. You will also want to include your health care provider’s contact information as well as your emergency contact.Don’t underplay anything related to your heart. Eat well, get your cardiovascular system checked out, and be sure to stay active. Committing to keeping your heart happy will help you live a much healthier life.ResourcesNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (Heart Attack)American Heart Association (Atherosclerosis)The Heart and Stroke Foundation (Heart Attack)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsAll AgesHow Do You Get Rid of Bunions?All Ages8 Health and Wellness Tips for WinterAll AgesIs Sparkling Water Good for You?Golden YearsWhat Are the Signs of Myelofibrosis?All AgesHow to Recognize Post-Traumatic Stress DisorderSandwich GenerationWhy People Use Cord Blood Banksyou may also likeEmpty Nester8 Natural Treatments for Fibromyalgia Worth TryingEmpty NesterWhat Are the Signs of Sleep Apnea?Empty NesterGet the Facts About Coronary Artery DiseaseEmpty Nester11 Ways to Cope With Erectile Dysfunctionconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsOur TeamContact UsHealthLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

As women, our bodies send different warning signals than men when there is an issue in our bodies, including when we have a heart attack. Since the warning signs of a heart attack in women are different compared to men, it is good to know what the symptoms are and how to catch them early.What Is a Heart Attack?All parts of your body need oxygen and the heart is no exception. Your heart is responsible for sending oxygenated blood throughout the body as well as to itself. If the blood flow delivering oxygen to the heart is met by a roadblock that does not allow enough oxygen through, it results in a heart attack. These blockages that cause heart attacks happen due to the slow accumulation of fat, cholesterol and plaque in the arteries.How Heart Attacks Are Different in Men and WomenIn the grand scheme of things, the body mechanics of men and women operate quite similarly, albeit with some differences here and there. Heart attacks are different in men and women for a variety of reasons.Subtle SymptomsWomen’s bodies may start to exhibit warning symptoms weeks or months ahead of the heart attack itself. With such a lag in time, it is easier shrug off symptoms rather than look into them further, especially if they mimic the symptoms of acid reflux, the flu, or normal aging. While men have more typical symptoms of central chest pain, women are more likely to experience shortness of breath, pressure in the lower chest, upper back pressure, fatigue, or light-headedness.Arm PainDuring a heart attack, men are more likely to feel pain in the left arm. In women, pain can be felt in either arm.AgeThe average age for a man to have his first heart attack is 65 years old. The first heart attack for women is around age 72. An explanation for this age gap is possibly due to estrogen’s effect on blood vessels.Medical Attention and TreatmentPossibly as a result of subtle symptoms, women generally do not reach out to a medical professional as quickly as men, and women are less often referred for appropriate treatment. Following a heart attack, women are less likely to engage in therapies, like blood pressure medication, which generally means their outcomes following a heart attack are worse than men.Location of Heart DiseaseAdding to the reasons why women’s symptoms may mask heart disease, women and men experience heart disease in different areas. Women’s heart disease is usually found in the smaller blood vessels of the heart (microvascular disease), while in men, heart disease is more likely in the major coronary arteries.Warning Signs of a Heart Attack in WomenThere is a window of time prior to a heart attack that women can recognize that they should check in on their health. If you experience these symptoms you will want to get a checkup:Chest discomfortShortness of breathCold sweatsNauseaLight-headednessFatigueIndigestionAnxietyDiscomfort in the shoulder area, headaches and vision problemsSymptoms of a Heart Attack for a WomanThe most common symptom of a heart attack is chest pain or discomfort, but actual heart attack symptoms may not be related to chest pain at all. Symptoms during a heart attack can be:Pain in the back, jaw, or neck. When there are heart issues, nerves in that area are triggered, but you may feel the pain elsewhere. Pay particular attention if the origin of the pain is hard to pinpoint (you are not feeling the pain in a specific muscle or joint).Intense fatigue. When simple activities make you excessively exhausted, you may be having heart distress.Breathing difficulties. Notice when you cannot catch your breath or breathing worsens when lying down and improves when you are propped up.Sweating. You start to sweat without reason, or you feel cold and clammy.Arm pain. Pain or discomfort may come from one or both arms.Related Search Topics Symptoms of Ovarian CancerDiabetes Type 2 SymptomsShingles SymptomsLiver Cancer Facts You May Also Like5 Tips for Staying Healthy in Your FiftiesEmpty Nester5 Tips for Staying Healthy in Your Fifties6 years ago| by Sheree McDonaldNo longer is turning 50 considered a gateway to old age. Here are five health tips for your 50s to make it the healthiest years of your life.Heart Attack Treatment OptionsThe earlier you treat your heart issues, the better chance you have to nip the problem in the bud before it becomes a heart attack. Effective heart attack treatment options are performed by medical professionals.MedicationsWith a heart attack, blood thinning medications or medications that dissolve or prevent blood clots are given by the doctor to help maintain blood flow through the affected artery. A doctor may use aspirin, thrombolytics, antiplatelet agents, or heparin.Other medicine that may be used is nitroglycerin, as it dilates blood vessels to improve blood flow and is also used to manage chest pain. Beta blockers take pressure off the heart by relaxing heart muscle, slowing the heartbeat and decreasing blood pressure. ACE inhibitors also lower blood pressure.Surgical and Other TreatmentsCoronary angioplasty and stenting are commonly used in a surgical procedure for heart attack patients. A catheter tube goes to the site of the artery blockage. There is a balloon on the catheter that inflates briefly to open the blocked coronary artery, where a mesh stent may be inserted. This stent keeps the artery open long term to restore blood flow to the heart.There’s also coronary artery bypass surgery. This is where the veins or arteries are sewn in place beyond the blocked coronary artery allowing a different route for blood to flow to the heart (and bypassing the blocked section).Also, cardiac rehabilitation is used.

They are medically referred to as osteophytes and are pointy bone growths that develop along the edges of bones. They usually form at the joints of the body, where the bones meet each other. Bone spurs commonly form on the joints in the lower back, neck, hip, shoulder, knee, fingers, foot, heel and big toe.Most are not easily noticed, as they often cause mild to no symptoms, allowing most people to function normally. Bone spurs may only be discovered incidentally by body scans, which may be used in order to check for other structural abnormalities, or as part of a routine medical checkup.What Is the Cause?The most common cause of bone spurs is damaged tissue, which is often a consequence of osteoarthritis - a medical condition that damages cartilage and leads to joint stiffness and pain, or tendinitis – a medical condition in which tendons that connect muscles to bones become inflamed.When tissue damage happens, the body tries to repair the loss by stimulating the cells that are responsible for bone formation to release and deposit bone along the affected area. This bone deposit results in the pointed swelling or bulge.Where Do Bone Spurs Form?They may occur in the spine as a result of a type of arthritis that affects the spine. This spinal arthritis is called ankylosing spondylitis and it results from the swelling of the ligament, a fibrous connective tissue that joins bone to bone, around the degenerating discs between the vertebrae.Also, they may occur in the heel, at the back of the calcaneus bone, as a consequence of inflammation of the Achilles tendon. Additionally, they may develop when the plantar fascia tissue, which is located under the heel bone, experiences inflammation. Other inflammatory arthritis conditions that can cause bone spurs in the heel include reactive arthritis and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH)/ Forestier’s disease.A few cases have been found to be congenital. A popular example of a congenital spur is osteochondroma.Other causes:DietGeneticsObesityInjuries/overuseSpinal conditions (i.e. spinal stenosis)Related Search Topics Arthritis Pain ReliefShingles SymptomsDiabetes Type 2 SymptomsLiver Cancer Facts You May Also LikeWhat to Expect from Your Gynecologist AppointmentSandwich GenerationWhat to Expect from Your Gynecologist Appointment6 years ago| by Natalie SaundersBefore going to your first gynecologist appointment, here are a few things you can expect, how to prepare, and how to stay healthy between visits.Symptoms of Bone SpursThe symptoms largely vary depending on the location of the spur. They can cause symptoms if they irritate tissues including nerves, skin, fat and/or tendons.SpineIn the spine they can cause irritation of the spinal cord and/or nerve roots. This is because the spinal canal, which houses the spinal cord, may become narrowed by the bone spur, leading to numbness, stiffness, pain, tingling and/or weakness in the area that the affected nerve supplies.KneeIn the knee they can often lead to pain when extending and flexing the knee.FingersIn the fingers they often cause lumps and swelling in the lower finger joints.HipsBone spurs in the hip often limit movement in and around the hip joint, resulting in hip pain, and in some cases, knee pain.ShoulderBone spurs in the shoulder cause swelling, limiting the space needed for the ligaments and tendons to function optimally, resulting in decreased range of motion, and may also lead to tearing of the rotator cuff muscles.NeckIn the neck they can irritate nearby nerves and lead to pain, weakness and numbness.HeelIn the heel they can cause pain, tenderness and swelling, and may lead to issues with walking.What Are the Treatment Options?Treatment is only necessary when they are symptomatic. Initially, treatment is focused on relieving pain and inflammation. It’s recommended that patients first try conservative treatment options before undergoing more radical treatment techniques.Resting the area and applying ice for 10 to 15 minutes at a time can help to decrease local inflammation and pain. For pain relief, over-the-counter pain medications, including acetaminophen, are recommended. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen or naproxen sodium, are often used too. Many health professionals advocate corticosteroid injection into the joint to ease pain and reduce swelling; however, it is important to note that this is a temporary solution and the injection may have to be repeated.There are also mechanical techniques for the treatment. The use of local bone spur pads and shoe inserts (orthotics) often provide relief. Overweight sufferers of bone spurs may be advised to shed some weight and rest the affected areas in order to reduce the strain on the joints. Physical therapy, including stretching and strengthening exercises of the affected area, may also be recommended. If the above conservative treatment options fail, surgery may be warranted. Currently there is no way to prevent bone spurs from developing.In ConclusionBone spurs often do not cause symptoms, but when they do they can range from mild discomfort to debilitating pain. Often symptoms can be relieved with rest, ice, over-the-counter pain medications and NSAIDs, mechanical devices, and/or physical therapy. However, some cases do require surgery.ResourcesMayo Clinic (Bone spurs)MedicineNet (Bone Spurs)NHS (Osteophyte (bone spur))Harvard Health Publishing (Bone spurs)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsTwenty-SomethingWhy Does Alcohol Make Us Sleepy?Empty NesterWhat Are the 4 Types of Pneumonia?Golden Years5 Reasons an Engraved Medical ID Beats a CellphoneAll AgesWhat You Need to Know About Nontuberculous Mycobacteria and Lung InfectionsAll AgesCan Wearing a Surgical Mask Help With Allergies?All AgesWhy Is Calcium Good for Our Bodies?you may also likeSandwich Generation4 Safe Exercises to Cope With ScoliosisSandwich GenerationPrimary Immunodeficiency: A Weakened Immune System Against InfectionSandwich Generation5 Signs You May Be at Risk for Carpal Tunnel SyndromeSandwich Generation8 Signs of an Ovarian Cystconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsOur TeamContact UsHealthLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Understanding the Causes of AmenorrheaFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail3 years ago| by Miles Martin What Is Amenorrhea?What is amenorrhea? It is the medical term for when a woman does not menstruate (get her period), regardless of the cause. It is not usually a deadly condition and it affects about 1% of American women.Because it is a physiological state rather than a disease caused by a specific pathogen, there can be several possible causes, which may have different treatment options. This article will walk you through the causes, symptoms and treatment options, as well as tips on how to prevent this condition when possible.Causes of AmenorrheaThere are two categories; primary is when a young woman experiences delays in getting her first period and secondary occurs in adult women when menstruation stops. The most common cause of primary is a family history of it.There are several different causes of secondary amenorrhea and some of them are just natural functions of the body, while others are unnatural.Natural CausesPregnancyWomen do not get their period during pregnancy and a late period is often an early indicator of pregnancy. Amenorrhea also lasts for about six to eight weeks after giving birth in women who do not breastfeed.BreastfeedingIn women who do breastfeed, amenorrhea may continue for the duration of the breastfeeding period, or they may get their period again while still breastfeeding. It can vary from woman to woman.MenopauseWomen who have completed menopause experience permanent amenorrhea as part of a natural life cycle.Unnatural CausesContraceptivesBirth control pills and other forms of contraception may stop periods in certain women. In fact, one motivation for taking birth control for some women is shorter, lighter periods that occur less frequently.Other MedicationsAntipsychotics, cancer chemotherapy, antidepressants, blood pressure medication and allergy medicines are all drugs that may cause women to stop having their period.Lifestyle FactorsLow body weight, excessive exercise and stress may all be contributing factors for lack of a period. This is why women with eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia often experience amenorrhea.Hormonal ImbalanceMenstruation is regulated by hormones, so hormonal imbalances can throw this cycle out of whack. Some of the illnesses that can cause these imbalances include polycystic ovary syndrome, thyroid malfunction, a pituitary tumor, or premature menopause.Structural DefectsSometimes the issue is purely physical. Women with advanced uterine scarring may experience this health condition and congenital issues with the reproductive organs may cause a woman never to get her period.What Are the Symptoms?It is very easy to spot, since the primary symptom is not getting a period, which will be easily noticed by most women. Additional symptoms of amenorrhea vary based on the cause, but can include:HeadachesVision changesNauseaFacial hairChanges in breast sizeMilky discharge from the breastsTreatment OptionsWhen it is caused by pregnancy, breastfeeding, or menopause, it cannot be treated and is part of the normal, healthy lifecycle of a woman. In some other cases, it will not be desirable to treat. For example, a young woman on birth control who does not get her period may be perfectly happy that way. However, amenorrhea caused by an underlying health condition should be treated.In young women experiencing the primary type, the best treatment is often to watch and wait, since periods may start naturally on their own. In young women experiencing this as a result of an anatomical issue, surgery may help, but this is not a guarantee.Related Search Topics Symptoms of Ovarian CancerTreatment For HerpesTreatments for DepressionLiver Cancer Facts You May Also LikeIs It a Sinus Infection or a Cold?All AgesIs It a Sinus Infection or a Cold?6 years ago| by Katrina HodginsHow can you tell the difference between a sinus infection vs. cold? While some symptoms overlap, there are some key differences.Secondary Amenorrhea Treatment OptionsFor secondary types, the treatments largely depend on the underlying cause that is determined by your doctor.Adjusting Lifestyle FactorsIf amenorrhea is caused by either excessive weight loss or exercise, changing exercise plan or diet may help periods return to normal. Receiving treatment for mental health in the form of counseling or medications may help if amenorrhea is thought to be caused by stress.MedicationsIf amenorrhea is caused by a thyroid issue, hormonal imbalance, or other disease, a doctor can prescribe an appropriate treatment that may also handle the amenorrhea.Adjusting Birth ControlIf amenorrhea is caused by birth control, then changing the type of birth control or stopping birth control entirely may cure the amenorrhea. However, this may not always be necessary if a woman is otherwise healthy.Prevention MethodsNatural amenorrhea is unpreventable, since it is considered normal and healthy. Not all unnatural causes of amenorrhea are easily predicted and prevented, like amenorrhea caused by a thyroid problem, hormonal imbalance, or physical problem.Amenorrhea caused by lifestyle factors may be preventable by maintaining a healthy weight, moderating exercise and reducing stress. Amenorrhea caused by birth control is easily preventable by not taking the birth control or sticking to forms of birth control that do not interfere with the body, like condoms.Talk to Your DoctorAmenorrhea can be frightening if you are not expecting it, but it is not generally considered a deadly condition and, depending on the cause, it may even be normal and healthy. But you should always discuss new symptoms with your doctor, since they know your medical history and can help you determine if your amenorrhea needs to be treated.ResourcesMedicalNewsToday (What is amenorrhea?)Mayo Clinic (Amenorrhea)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsSandwich GenerationFour Tips for Buying the Right Toothpaste for Your ToddlerGolden YearsThe Five Most Common Health Concerns for SeniorsGolden YearsHow Can Elderly Prevent Falls?

Understanding the Cause of Unpredictable EmotionsFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail7 years ago| by Eric Patterson Why Am I So Emotional?It’s not that you’re sad all the time. It’s not that you’re angry all the time or even annoyed all the time. Instead, your moods change wildly from hour to hour and day to day.Sometimes, it is easy to understand your shifting feelings. When someone makes a thoughtless comment, you get annoyed. When an important event doesn’t go your way, you get angry.Other times are not so clear, though. You notice you are getting sad or anxious for no reason, and the intensity of your response always seems disproportionate to the trigger because tiny problems produce huge results.You are emotional. The problem is obvious, but now, you are interested in understanding where this unpredictability stems from.When you know the source of your symptoms, you can combat them and find a solution. The cause is not always clear since a combination of physical health, mental health, and stress management issues can all contribute.Possible factors leading towards your unsteady emotions include the following.Physical Health ProblemsThough looking directly at your mental health may seem obvious, taking that step might be premature because there is a range of physical health problems that can result in feeling moody or overly emotional.People who struggle with changing blood sugar frequently feel anxious when levels are low. Thyroid issues are strongly associated with mood changes and irritability. Problems with moodiness are related to cardiovascular issues. If you are a woman in her mid or late 40s, menopause might be to blame for your problems.These physical ailments, which are only a small sampling of possible complications, can be identified through a number measures and diagnostic procedures. By treating the primary physical health condition, the mental health effects of being emotion will recuperate.During your treatment, focus on improving your diet, activity levels, and sleep to further boost your physical state.Mental Health ProblemsIf your visits to the physician’s office did not prove successful, it might be time to consider a mental health source of your emotional changes.There is a range of mental health problems that are related to being moody or overly emotional. There is also a huge amount of misinformation that surrounds mental health, so be sure to avoid self-diagnosis.Related Search Topics What Is Liver CancerWeight Loss Diet PlanArthritis Pain ReliefLiver Cancer Facts You May Also LikeDo Men and Women Experience Depression Differently?All AgesDo Men and Women Experience Depression Differently?6 years ago| by Eric PattersonMen and women both experience depression, however, their symptoms can be very different. Learn what the differences of depression in men and women are here.When people think about changing moods and being emotional, they often think of bipolar disorder. If I am happy one minute and sad the next, I must be bipolar, right? No.Moodiness can be a sign of bipolar disorder, but many more a needed for a diagnosis. Bipolar is marked by having periods of depression with symptoms presenting more often than not for at least two weeks and periods of mania or hypomania lasting for at least four days.People who are described as “emotional” do not meet the criteria for bipolar disorder.To be certain of your mental health, seek out an evaluation from a mental health specialist. Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other mental health conditions are linked to changing moods, but the risk of these disorders remains low relative to other explanations.A mental health expert can ask questions to assess your presenting problems and the history of your symptoms to formulate a complete diagnosis appropriate for you.Poor Stress ManagementThe third contributor to being overly emotional is probably the simplest and most common: poor stress management.Everyone has an ever-changing level of stress that is equal to their stresses minus their coping skills. Even when stress is high, effective coping skills can counteract the results of many stressors. The problems come when coping skills are too few or ineffective.Think about your daily stress. By the time you wake up, you might be at a 50 out of 100. A series of stressors occur during your day causing your number to increase, and without stress management skills, your number will stay high.Anytime you approach 100, you have an emotional response in the form of an unwanted behavior, negative thought, or problematic feeling, which reduces your stress number only slightly.Being late to work sparks feelings of frustration. Getting yelled at by your boss causes you to speak more pessimistically. Spilling your afternoon coffee on your pants triggers your decision to storm out of your office crying.During this day, your emotions were strong and frequently changing. Your level of stress peaked near 100 each time and stayed close to the top making it more likely for even minor stressors to elicit an emotional reaction.Managing StressPeople who seem calm and collected probably don’t have fewer stressors; they probably have better coping skills to manage their stress. Do you want to finally put stress in its place? Here’s how:Acknowledge your levels. People with high levels of stress usually try hard not to think about their stress, but this is a mistake. To improve your stress, you must study it. What makes it better? What makes it worse? Think of your stress level like a thermometer; it is not just high or low — there are many degrees in between.Dismiss the contributors. Thinking about your stress may lead you to notice that certain people or things regularly spark your stress. Seek to improve these issues whenever possible. If nothing can be done, avoidance may be your only option.Find the positives. Exercise, spend time with friends, watch your favorite movie, listen to a meaningful song, take a long bath, or yell into a pillow. Your mission is to experiment with coping skills that work for you.Use prevention more than damage control. Some people only use coping skills as damage control after the stress has happened. These are helpful, but often too little too late. Instead of waiting to use coping skills when stress is high, perform them early and often to keep stress low.Why are you so emotional? It can be really hard to tell, so take practical steps to assess your physical and mental well-being.With a clean bill of health, you can focus on the problem of stress management. Find your contributors, avoid the ones you can, and then explore preventive coping skills to reduce your stress to reduce your emotionality and moodiness. You might be a few steps away from the stability you seek.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsSandwich Generation7 Causes of Insomnia During PregnancyGolden Years7 Chronic Pain Management and Coping TechniquesEmpty NesterHigh Cholesterol: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment and NutritionGolden Years5 Reasons an Engraved Medical ID Beats a CellphoneEmpty NesterTired of Waking Up in Drenched Sheets?

How to store cefalexin Important information about all medicines About cefalexinType of medicineA cephalosporin antibioticUsed forTreatment (and sometimes prevention) of infectionAlso calledCephalexin (in US); KeflexÂ®Available asCapsules, tablets, and oral liquid medicineCefalexin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which means that it is active against a wide variety of germs (bacteria). It is used to treat bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections, skin infections, chest and throat infections, ear infections and dental infections. It is suitable for adults and children and can be taken during pregnancy. Some people who are allergic to penicillin antibiotics may not be able to take cefalexin, so make sure your doctor knows if you have ever had an allergic reaction to any other antibiotic.Cefalexin treats an infection by killing the bacteria that are causing it.Before taking cefalexinSome medicines are not suitable for people with certain conditions, and sometimes a medicine may only be used if extra care is taken. For these reasons, before you (or your child, if appropriate) start taking cefalexin it is important that your doctor knows:If you have ever had an allergic reaction to a medicine. It is particularly important that you tell your doctor if you have had a bad reaction to a penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotic.If you have any problems with the way your kidneys work.If you are pregnant, trying for a baby or breastfeeding. Although cefalexin is not known to be harmful to babies, it is still important that you tell your doctor if you are expecting or breastfeeding a baby.If you are taking or using any other medicines. This includes any medicines you are taking which are available to buy without a prescription, as well as herbal and complementary medicines.How to take cefalexinBefore you start taking cefalexin, read the manufacturer's printed information leaflet from inside the pack. It will give you more information about the antibiotic and will provide you with a full list of side-effects which you could experience from taking it.As a guide, it is usual to take 2-4 doses of cefalexin daily to treat an infection. Your doctor will tell you what dose is right for you (or your child) and the directions for taking it will be printed on the label of the pack to remind you about what the doctor said to you. If you have been given cefalexin liquid medicine to give to your child, please read the directions carefully to make sure that you give the correct amount. Your doctor will tell you how long your course of treatment will last - this is commonly about 5-7 days, although it could be for longer or shorter periods of time than this. It is important that you take cefalexin exactly as your doctor tells you to.If you have been prescribed cefalexin to prevent a urinary tract infection from recurring, you are likely to be asked to take just one dose a day. Please take it in the evening. A course of treatment such as this can last for some time.Cefalexin can be taken either before or after food, although it may start to work a little sooner if it is taken before food.Space the doses evenly throughout the day. Keep taking this medicine until the course is finished unless you are told to stop. It is important to take the full course (even if you feel your infection has cleared up) in order to prevent the infection from coming back.If you forget to take a dose, take one as soon as you remember. Try to take the correct number of doses each day but do not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose.Getting the most from your treatmentIf you are having an operation or any other medical treatment, tell the person carrying out the treatment that you are taking an antibiotic. This is because cefalexin can interfere with the results of some medical tests.Some people develop redness and itching in the mouth or vagina (thrush) after taking a course of antibiotics. If after taking cefalexin you think you could have thrush, please speak with your doctor or pharmacist for advice.If you are taking the contraceptive 'pill' at the same time as an antibiotic, the effectiveness of the 'pill' can be reduced if you have a bout of being sick (vomiting) or diarrhoea which lasts for more than 24 hours. If this should happen, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice about what additional contraceptive precautions to use. There is no need to use additional precautions for any bouts of sickness or diarrhoea which last for less than 24 hours.Antibiotics like cefalexin can stop the oral typhoid vaccine from working properly. If you are due to have any vaccinations, please make sure the person treating you knows that you are taking this antibiotic.Can cefalexin cause problems?Along with their useful effects, most medicines can cause unwanted side-effects although not everyone experiences them. The table below contains some of the ones associated with cefalexin. You will find a full list in the manufacturer's information leaflet supplied with the medicine.

You are just a week away from full term.How Big Is Your Baby At 36 Weeks?This week, babies are usually about the size of a large cabbage (1). An average baby measures 19.13in (48.6cm) in length and weighs about 6.30lb (2.859kg) (2).Baby Development In The 36th weekBody PartsDevelopment stageHeadThe size of the head is in proportion to the size of the body (3).SkinThe protective coating on the skin, called vernix, gets thicker. Thereâs an increase in body fat (4).LungsWill develop faster this week on (5).LanugoRemains on the head but disappears from the face (6).LimbsFully formed with fingernails and toenails.EarsEarlobes that are soft, with little cartilage, are formed.MusclesAre fully toned, and the baby can turn and lift the head.BonesAll the bones in the body, except the skull bones, continue to harden at this time. The skull bones stay separated and soft until after the birth, to make the babyâs descent through the cervix smoother (7).Digestive systemIs fully developed and ready to deal with breast milk.Fetal position and movements: By the 36th week, the baby attains a head-down position deep into your pelvis. The movements will be lesser compared to the previous months, due to the insufficient space inside the uterus. There will be more leg and arm movements and fewer squirming movements. Since the baby is head-down, you will feel the kicks mostly under your ribs.What symptoms of pregnancy do you experience in the 36th week?The symptoms in the 36th week are more or less similar to those you have been experiencing in the last couple of months. They include: Weight gain: An average weight gain of one to two pounds per week during the third trimester of pregnancy is considered safe, as recommended by the American Pregnancy Association (APA) (8). However, in case of women who have BMI less than 18.5 and greater than 24.9, the recommended weight gain rates usually range in between 0.5 to one pound. As the baby moves down into the pelvis, the pressure from the diaphragm is released, making it easier to breathe (9). You could feel nauseated, due to some bodily changes in the last few months. Slowed digestion, combined with the uterusâ pressure on the stomach, can push the food upwards into the esophagus, resulting in nausea and vomiting. Image: Shutterstock Body aches, frequent urge to urinate and anxiety about the delivery can cause trouble sleeping. You may experience pressure and discomfort in the pelvic area when the baby engages the head deep into the pelvis. The growing uterusâ pressure on the rectal veins causes the blood vessels to swell up in that area, resulting in hemorrhoids. The growing uterus also pushes the stomach acids into the esophagus, causing heartburn.Related: Heartburn During Pregnancy: Causes, Symptoms And Treatment As the digestion process slows down, the food remains in the digestive tract for a long time, making you feel bloated and gassy and can cause constipation. The excess water retention in the body causes swelling of feet and ankles. Image: Shutterstock Braxton Hicks contractions are irregular and painless contractions that help prepare your body for labor. Fatigue is quite common towards the end of pregnancy. The pressure exerted by the enlarged uterus increases the frequency of urination. The pregnancy hormones relax the joints, which can lead to hip pain. As there is a shift in the center of gravity of the body, you may feel clumsy. With just four weeks to go, you start experiencing bodily changes that indicate your baby is on track. Point to considerAt 36 weeks of pregnancy, you may also experience symptoms such as a heightened sense of smell, a milky-white vaginal discharge, and light spotting (1).Changes In The Body In The 36th WeekYour body is likely to undergo some of these physical and emotional changes during pregnancy.

Image: ShutterStockStomach flu during pregnancy, or viral gastroenteritis, is an infection by a virus that causes acute inflammation in the intestinal lining. Pregnant women are more prone to dealing with stomach flu and its complications because of their weakened immune systems (1).In most cases, this infection is self-limiting and does not harm the baby. Many home remedies may also help you deal with the issue. However, you should seek medical advice if you notice worrying symptoms such as high fever, fatigue, or diarrhea.Read this post to learn about the causes of stomach flu during pregnancy, its symptoms, treatment, and prevention.In This ArticleCauses Of Stomach Flu During PregnancyStomach Flu or Morning Sickness?Symptoms Of A Stomach FluHow To Deal With Stomach Bug During Pregnancy?Water Vs. Electrolyte Replacement Drinks: Which One Is Better?When Should You Call The Doctor?Can You Take Medication?How To Prevent Stomach Flu While You Are Pregnant?Can Stomach Infections Hurt Your Baby?Frequently Asked QuestionsInfographic: How To Deal With Stomach Bug During Pregnancy?Key PointersCauses Of Stomach Flu During PregnancyStomach flu or viral gastroenteritis can be caused by viruses such as norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, sapovirus, and astrovirus. Among these, noroviruses, also known as stomach bugs, cause approximately 50% of foodborne viral infection outbreaks worldwide (2). The illness is contracted from contaminated water or food that is made under unhygienic conditions or not cooked properly.You may also get viruses through direct contact with infected people or if you keep unwashed hands in your mouth after touching contaminated surfaces (2) (3).Note: Acute gastroenteritis can also be caused by bacteria like salmonella, listeria, shigella, and campylobacter jejuni (2). Though the symptoms are somewhat similar to stomach flu, it may require treatment with medication such as antibiotics. Stomach flu is not the flu, which is a respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus (3).Related: Norovirus Infections And Pregnancy - Everything You Should Be Aware Of Did you know?Norovirus outbreaks have been found to occur mostly from November to April. However, it may occur at any time (20).Stomach Flu or Morning Sickness?Stomach flu can be harder to identify during the early stages of pregnancy when most women suffer from morning sickness. However, if vomiting and nausea are accompanied by a lack of appetite, cramps, fever, or diarrhea, you may be suffering from stomach flu. Moreover, stomach flu will last only for a few days, while morning sickness remains until the second trimester (4).Symptoms Of A Stomach Flu Image: ShutterstockIn order to make sure that it is not morning sickness but stomach flu, you should look for a few more signs that show up in the first two days.The Possible Symptoms To Watch For Include (5): Severe diarrhea or loose, watery stools Abdominal pain and cramps Sudden low-grade fever Muscle aches Chills Fatigue Headache DehydrationThese symptoms may seem mild initially, but if they do not subside even after two days, you should check with a healthcare provider. It helps to treat the condition effectively. Dehydration can be very serious during pregnancy, whether caused by morning sickness or infection. No matter the cause, itâs important to see a doctor if your symptoms are severe.Related: Common Body Aches During Pregnancy And Tips To Deal With ThemHow To Deal With Stomach Bug During Pregnancy?If you are just beginning to feel the early symptoms, you can help yourself with a little care and effort. Here are some ways you can take care of yourself at home:1. Drink enough fluidsFluids are very important when you are suffering from stomach flu. Your body loses fluids through sweating, vomiting, and diarrhea. You are at risk of dehydration, especially if you are suffering from frequent urination or passing dark-colored urine. The lack of fluids may cause a reduction in the volume of blood, which may then compromise oxygen and nutrition supply to the growing fetus (6).Symptoms like constant thirst, dry mouth and skin, dark-colored urine, urine inconsistency, lack of urine, fatigue, or dizziness indicate dehydration (7).What to drink:Drink plenty of water, clear broth, warm water with lemon (relieves gas), decaffeinated tea or diluted juice (white grape juice is easy on tummy). Grape water, vegetable broth, soups, ginger ale, curd, yogurt, skimmed milk , and coconut water are good options. You can also prefer popsicles or ice chips if you cannot sip through liquids.You can add a dash of ginger to your juices or snacks, as it may help in combating infection. It also decreases nausea. After talking to your doctor, you can also drink over the counter oral rehydration solutions, such as Pedialyte, DripDrop, etc., to cope with fluid and electrolyte loss (6) (8).What not to drink: Caffeinated drinks such as strong black tea, coffee, and chocolate should be avoided. Stay away from alcohol as it is a diuretic and can aggravate your stomach flu. Stay away from outside food and junk food. You should also avoid undiluted fruit juices and sugary drinks that may increase diarrhea (6) (9). Drinks and food that contain a lot of fat should also be avoided since they increase diarrhea.Related: Caffeine (Coffee) During Pregnancy: Is It Safe?2. RestSickness and diarrhea due to stomach flu can make you feel tired and weak as your body fights against infection and also works to nurture your baby. Therefore, it is very important to get as much rest as possible. Rest until you feel you have recovered completely (10).3. Eat proper foodAs the symptoms of stomach flu begin to clear, you can gradually introduce bland and semi-solid foods. They are easier to digest. Solid foods are difficult for you to digest. Do not force yourself to eat more, as it can cause nausea.The BRAT diet (6): It is the best diet option to ease the stomach issue. It consists of bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast, which contain a considerable amount of carbohydrates. They provide energy and replenish your body with the nutrients lost through diarrhea and vomiting.Bananas: Ripe ones support digestion and replace the lost potassium.Rice: White rice is easy to digest and gives energy. Do not take brown rice as it contains high fiber, which could be hard on the stomach.Applesauce: Offers an energy boost through carbs and sugars present in it. It also contains pectin, which eases diarrhea.Toast: White bread is a good option and easy to digest. Whole wheat bread contains excess fiber, which is again not good for the digestive system.Boiled salty potatoes are also recommended during diarrhea, since it is aÂ good source of carbohydrates and the salt is good to replace the lost electrolytes.What not to eat (9): Dairy, fibrous, spicy, or fatty foods should be avoided.Dairy: Everyone may not have a problem with milk or dairy products, but they are not easily digestible.Fiber: Too much fiber can cause flatulence, bloating, loose stools, and diarrhea.Fatty foods: Do not include oily foods. Also, cut down spicy curries, chili sauces, and tomato containing dishes. Point to considerThe BRAT diet is low in nutrients compared to a healthy diet and you should be able to move to a regular diet within a day or two (21).Related: What To Eat & Avoid After A Miscarriage?4. GingerGinger is a natural digestion aid and an effective remedy for nausea (11). It may help relieve the symptoms of nausea and vomiting.

Here is how you can make brewed ginger tea:You will need: Freshly grated ginger â 1 1/2 teaspoon Boiling water â 1 1/2 cupHow to make: Take a cup and put the grated ginger. Now fill it with one-and-a-half cups of boiling water. Let it remain for about ten minutes and then strain it.If it tastes strong, you can add more boiling water to dilute the tea. Do not add any sweetener or sugar.5. MintAccording to The Oxford Book of Health Foods, written by J.G Vaughn, a professor of food sciences at Londonâs Kingâs College, and Dr. P.A. Judd, Principal Lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire, peppermint could also help combat an upset stomach, and it may ease symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. You can prepare peppermint tea the same way as ginger tea. You can also add lemon juice to add more flavor.6. ProbioticsConsuming probiotics may help in the management of acute gastroenteritis. You may continue to take them during the illness and also for at least two weeks later (12).7. Electrolyte drinksIdeally, your body system maintains a balance and contains ionic solutions known as electrolytes. They regulate the functioning of your body, nerves, and muscles. When you are suffering from stomach flu, you lose many of these ionic solutions through diarrhea and vomiting.To regain energy, stamina, and strength, you should replenish your body with the lost electrolytes. You can drink diluted, non-sugary natural fruit juices to prevent dehydration. You can drink diluted, non-sugary fruit juices to prevent dehydration.

It is just a precaution but not something to be overly concerned about. Do not consume food that may have been infected staying outside the refrigator for more than a couple of hours. Have a healthy diet, consume plenty of water, and do frequent and moderate exercises.Can Stomach Infections Hurt Your Baby?

Great for the bones: 100g of chicken contains 15mg of calcium and 182mg of phosphorus. Both these minerals play a significant role in the formation of strong bones. Vitamins facilitate brain development: Chicken is rich in vitamins including C and A. It also contains vitamin B12, also called cobalamin, which is essential for brain development in infants (3). Micronutrients for healthy immunity: Chicken contains micronutrients such as zinc and magnesium, which play a significant role in maintaining healthy immunity.Nutritional Value Of 100g Of Chicken, (broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw)Nutrient Unit Value Per 100gEnergy120KcalProtein22.5gFat (total lipid)2.62gCalcium5mgIron0.37mgMagnesium28mgPhosphorus213mgPotassium334mgSodium45mgZinc0.68mgVitamin B1 (Thiamin)0.094mgVitamin B2 (Riboflavin)0.177mgVitamin B3 (Niacin)9.6mgVitamin B60.811mgVitamin B9 (Folate)9ÂµgVitamin B120.21ÂµgVitamin A9ÂµgVitamin D0.2ÂµgVitamin E0.56mgSource: United States Department of Agriculture (4) How To Select And Store Chicken? Select: Always buy fresh chicken from a hygienic store where it is cleaned and dressed well. Any meat, including chicken, is prone to bacterial contamination, therefore, never buy frozen varieties. These could contain pathogens that harm the infant. Choose fresh, organic chicken where the bird is fed only natural food, which is free of antibiotics and hormones. Never buy salted or packaged chicken, which is processed with preservatives. Storage: Buy only as much as you need to cook for the baby . Do not freeze leftover chicken or the chicken baby food since bacteria can propagate easily in it.How To Process Chicken For Babies?Following are the best ways to cook chicken for your baby.1. BakeStep 1: Preheat the oven to 375ÂºF (190ÂºC).Step 2: Cut the chicken into small pieces so that it bakes thoroughly and evenly. 1lb or 453g of chicken takes about 20 minutes to cook properly.Step 3: You can coarsely puree the chicken with water after it is baked.

Other symptoms that may occur include pain in your jaw muscles when you chew which eases when you rest the jaw muscles, and visual loss.See a doctor immediately if you suspect that you have temporal arteritis. People with temporal arteritis need urgent treatment with steroids. Treatment aims to prevent serious complications such as severe sight impairment which can occur soon after the disease starts.In this article What is temporal arteritis?

Temporal arteritis treatment Some other points about steroid tablets In This Article Temporal ArteritisGiant Cell ArteritisIn this article What is temporal arteritis? Temporal arteritis symptoms What are the possible complications of temporal arteritis? Do I need any tests for temporal arteritis? Temporal arteritis treatment Some other points about steroid tablets What is temporal arteritis?Temporal arteritis, also known as giant cell arteritis (GCA), is a condition which causes inflammation on the inside of some blood vessels (arteries). It is called 'giant cell' because abnormal large cells develop in the wall of the inflamed arteries. The arteries commonly affected are those around the head and neck area. One of the arteries that is commonly affected is the temporal artery. (You have a temporal artery on each side of the head. They are under the skin to the sides of the forehead - the temple area.) Therefore, the condition is sometimes called temporal arteritis. Several arteries may be affected at the same time.GCA is uncommon and mainly affects people over the age of 60 years. It rarely affects people aged under 50 years. Women are more commonly affected than men. The cause is not known.Temporal arteritis symptomsSymptoms of temporal arteritis can vary, and may depend on which blood vessel/s (artery or arteries) are mainly affected.Headache is the common symptom. It occurs in about two thirds of people with giant cell arteritis (GCA). This typically develops suddenly over a day or so but it sometimes develops gradually over several days or weeks. The headache can be one-sided, or on both sides. Typically, it is mainly towards the front and sides of the head.Tenderness of the scalp over the temporal arteries is common. You may be able to feel one or both of the inflamed temporal arteries under the skin, or see them in a mirror.Other symptoms may occur if the arteries going to these parts of the body are inflamed, become narrowed and reduce the blood supply to these areas. These include:Pain in the jaw muscles (jaw claudication) while eating or talking. This occurs in nearly half of affected people. The pain eases when you rest the jaw muscles.Visual disturbances: permanent partial or complete loss of vision in one or both eyes occurs in up to 1 in 5 affected people and is often an early symptom. People who are affected typically report a feeling of a shade covering one eye, which can progress to total loss of vision. The eye is not painful. If untreated, the second eye is likely to become affected within 1-2 weeks, although it can be affected within 24 hours. Urgent treatment is therefore essential. A temporary loss of vision in one eye or double vision (diplopia) may occur as a 'warning' symptom before any permanent visual loss.Some general symptoms also commonly occur. These include tiredness, depression, night sweats, fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. These may develop gradually and may be present for weeks or even months before a specific symptom such as headache or visual loss develops.Polymyalgia rheumatica - is often also presentUp to half of people with temporal arteritis develop a related condition called polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). If this develops it often occurs at the same time but may occur before or after the development of temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis). The typical symptoms of PMR are pain, tenderness and stiffness of muscles around the shoulders and upper arms, and sometimes around the hips and neck. PMR is due to inflammation in the affected muscles, but the cause is unknown. The treatment is similar for both conditions. Treatment for PMR is usually very effective. See the separate leaflet called Polymyalgia Rheumatica for more details.What are the possible complications of temporal arteritis?Note: complications are much less likely to occur if treatment is started soon after symptoms begin.Possible complications include the following:Total loss of vision in one or both eyesIf an affected blood vessel (artery) becomes very swollen (inflamed), the blood supply going down that artery can become blocked. The most common arteries this affects are the small arteries going to the eye. If one of these arteries becomes blocked it can cause permanent, serious visual problems, even total loss of vision, in the affected eye. Total or partial loss of vision may occur in up to 1 in 5 people with untreated giant cell arteritis (GCA). Once vision is lost, there is little chance of recovery of vision, even with treatment. Therefore, treatment is aimed at preventing visual loss or, if visual loss has occurred in one eye, to prevent loss in the other eye. However, even with treatment, visual loss occurs in up to 1 in 20 cases.Problems related to other arteries being affectedOther serious complications sometimes develop if the inflammation occurs in other arteries. For example, serious complications can include a heart attack, an aortic aneurysm, a stroke, damage to nerves, or deafness (caused by a blocked artery in the brain).Do I need any tests for temporal arteritis?A blood test can detect if there is inflammation in your body. This is the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test or the C-reactive protein (CRP) test. If the blood test shows a high level of inflammation and you have the typical symptoms then temporal arteritis is likely. However, the blood test is not specific for GCA (it can also be high in other inflammatory disorders). Also, some people with GCA have a normal blood test.To confirm the diagnosis a doctor may take a small part of the temporal artery (a biopsy) to look at under a microscope. If you have GCA a doctor can see the inflammation and abnormal giant cells in the sample of the blood vessel (artery) wall.Temporal arteritis treatmentIf temporal arteritis is suspected, treatment is usually started straightaway - even before a sample taken (a biopsy) can confirm the diagnosis. The main aim is to reduce the risk of possible complications. The second aim is to relieve the headache and any other symptoms.Steroid tabletsA steroid medicine such as prednisolone is the usual main treatment. Steroids work by reducing inflammation. After starting treatment, symptoms usually ease within a few days.A high dose of steroid is started at first, usually about 60 mg per day. This is then reduced gradually to a lower 'maintenance' dose. It may take several months to reduce the dose gradually. The maintenance dose needed to keep symptoms away and prevent complications varies from person to person. Usually it is around 10 mg per day.In some people the condition goes away after 2-3 years, allowing the steroid treatment to be gradually withdrawn. This should always be done under supervision of a doctor. However, many people need treatment for several years, sometimes for life.If taking steroids causes too many or severe side-effects then other medications, such as methotrexate or tocilizumab, may be used instead.A medicine to prevent 'thinning of the bones' (osteoporosis)This may be advised - see below for the reasons.Some other points about steroid tabletsDo not stop taking steroid tablets suddenly. It probably does no harm if you forget to take the odd tablet. However, once your body is used to steroids, if you stop the tablets suddenly you may develop serious withdrawal effects within a few days.Do not take anti-inflammatory painkillers whilst you take steroids, unless advised by a doctor. The two together increase your risk of developing a stomach ulcer.Most people who take regular steroids carry a steroid card. This gives details of your dose, condition, etc, in case of emergencies.If you are ill with other conditions, or have surgery, the dose of steroid may need to be increased for a short time. This is because you need more steroid during physical stress.Side-effectsThe risk of developing side-effects from steroids is increased with higher doses. This is why the dose used is the lowest that keeps symptoms away. Possible side-effects from steroids include the following:'Thinning of the bones' (osteoporosis) - but you can take a medicine to help protect against this if you are at increased risk. For example, if you are aged 65 years or older, or have a history of fractures, you should take a medicine to help protect against osteoporosis. Your doctor will advise. If you are aged less than 65 years and do not have a history of fractures you may be offered a special scan which measures bone density (a DXA scan). If your bone density is below a certain level you may be offered a medicine to protect against osteoporosis. See the separate leaflet called Preventing Steroid-induced Osteoporosis for more information.Increased chance of infections - in particular, a severe form of chickenpox and measles. Note: most people have had chickenpox and are immune to it. Also, most people have either had measles or have been immunised against it and are immune. But, if you have not had chickenpox or measles (or immunisation for measles), keep away from people with measles, chickenpox, or shingles (which is caused by the same virus as chickenpox). Tell a doctor if you come into contact with anyone with these conditions if you are unsure about your medical past history.Weight gain.Increase in blood pressure. Have your blood pressure checked regularly. It can be treated if it becomes high.High blood sugar which may mean extra treatment if you have diabetes. Steroids may occasionally cause diabetes to develop. If you take long-term steroids, your doctor may arrange a yearly blood sugar test to check for diabetes - in particular, if you have a family history of diabetes.Skin problems such as poor healing after injuries, thinning skin and easy bruising. Stretchmarks sometimes develop.Muscle weakness.Mood and behavioural changes. Some people actually feel better in themselves when they take steroids. However, steroids may aggravate depression and other mental health problems and may occasionally cause mental health problems. If this side-effect occurs it tends to happen within a few weeks of starting treatment and is more likely with higher doses. Some people become confused and irritable. They may even develop delusions and suicidal thoughts. These mental health effects can also occur when steroid treatment is being withdrawn. Seek medical advice if worrying mood or behavioural changes occur.An increased risk of developing cataracts.An increased risk of duodenal ulcers and stomach ulcers. Tell your doctor if you develop indigestion or stomach (abdominal) pains.Although the above points have to be mentioned, do not be put off about steroids. The relief of symptoms and the prevention of serious complications usually outweigh the risk of side-effects from the doses of steroids used for temporal arteritis.Previous article Vitreous Haemorrhage Next article Charles Bonnet Syndrome Are you protected against flu?See if you are eligible for a free NHS flu jab today.Check nowJoin our weekly wellness digestfrom the best health experts in the businessEnter your email Join now Please enter a valid email address.

NICE has issued rapid update guidelines in relation to many of these. This guidance is changing frequently. Please visit https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19 to see if there is temporary guidance issued by NICE in relation to the management of this condition, which may vary from the information given below.In this article Epidemiology Aetiology and risk factors Site (the most common first) Proliferation markers Presentation Differential diagnosis Investigations Management Prognosis In This Article MeningiomasIn this article Epidemiology Aetiology and risk factors Site (the most common first) Proliferation markers Presentation Differential diagnosis Investigations Management Prognosis See related separate articles Brain Tumours in Adults and Brain Tumours in Children.Meningiomas are mostly benign tumours which arise from the dura mater and are usually slow-growing. Meningiomas usually form well-circumscribed lesions but, rarely, can be more diffuse - eg, when they grow next to the sphenoid ridge and are called 'meningioma en plaque'. Meningiomas occur either intracranially or within the spinal canal. Meningiomas can be graded in various ways - eg, site of origin, encroachment of surrounding tissues and histological grading. The most common system used is the World Health Organization (WHO) classification:[1]Grade I (generally benign): meningothelial, psammomatous, secretory, fibroblastic, angiomatous, lymphoplasmacyte-rich, transitional, microcystic, metaplastic.Grade II (there is a higher rate of recurrence after surgery, especially if a resection is incomplete): clear-cell, chordoid, atypical. Chordoid type has been associated with Castleman's disease (an uncommon lymphoproliferative disorder).Grade III (anaplastic): papillary (rare and mostly seen in children), rhabdoid and anaplastic. Grade III meningiomas are malignant with a high rate of local invasion, recurrence and metastases.Epidemiology[2]They are the most common tumours in the central nervous system, accounting for about one-third of all adult central nervous system tumours.[3, 4]The reported annual incidence of cerebral meningiomas ranges from 1.3/100,000 to 7.8/100,000.[5]There is a female:male ratio of 2:1.2-3% of the population have asymptomatic meningiomas and 8% have multiple meningiomas.Aetiology and risk factorsAetiology is not known and most cases are sporadic.[1]Some are increased in the presence of certain genetic disorders - eg, loss of chromosome 22 and presence of neurofibromatosis type 2.[1, 6]Other risk factors include advanced age, cranial irradiation, head injury and breast cancer (although causality not determined).[2, 3]Site (the most common first)Skull vault.Skull base - eg, sphenoid wing and petrous ridge.Sites of dural reflection - eg, falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli.Optic nerve sheath.Choroid plexus.Spine (rarely).Outside the craniospinal axis (very rarely) - eg, the ear, temporal bone and foot.Proliferation markersProliferation markers provide information on the likelihood of recurrence. For example, MIB-1 and Ki67 are found in higher levels of tumours that are likely to recur.[2, 7] However, further work is needed to clarify the role of proliferation markers and prognosis.Meningiomas can also express progesterone receptors.[8]Higher levels of progesterone receptors have been reported to be associated with a lower frequency of recurrence and a better prognosis.More than 70% of meningiomas express somatostatin receptors which can be used with radiological imaging, especially when looking for local recurrence.[2, 9]PresentationMeningiomas present as a space-occupying lesion.Seizures - focal or generalised are common with meningiomas.Raised intracranial pressure effects - eg, obstructive hydrocephalus with headache.Neuropsychological effects - eg, change in personality and disinhibition in frontal lesions.Neurological features - eg, cranial nerve palsies depending on location of a meningioma or language dysfunction.Transient ischaemic attack and intracranial haemorrhage may also be seen.Meningiomas that compress the visual pathways cause visual field defects.Other rare presentations include:Meningiomas near the sella turcica may produce panhypopituitarism.Spinal meningiomas may cause Brown-Séquard's syndrome.Differential diagnosisThis is as for space-occupying lesions. Meningiomas can be discovered incidentally when patients are investigated for other conditions. Other lesions which may also affect the dura mater include:Other primary brain tumours.Metastases from lymphoma and adenocarcinoma.Inflammatory disorders - eg, sarcoidosis.Infections - eg, tuberculosis.InvestigationsImaging - MRI is superior to CT scanning as it shows the dural origin. Meningiomas are well-defined, extra-axial lesions. They may show central cystic degeneration and oedema of nearby white matter.Endovascular angiography allows pre-operative assessment of the blood supply of the tumour and its proximity to vital vascular structures.Biopsy - stereotactic biopsy via a skull burr-hole or open exploration (craniotomy).ManagementManagement will depend on the clinical presentation, age of the patient, site of the tumour and size of the tumour. For example, an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities who is discovered incidentally to have a small, asymptomatic meningioma, can be managed conservatively. This usually consists of yearly MRI scans for three years and then just clinical follow-up if nothing new has developed.[2]Endovascular embolisationThis involves embolisation of the blood supply to the meningioma - eg, coil or glue applied endovascularly to the meningeal artery.[10]This is usually performed before surgical removal, as it reduces the amount of blood loss.[11]It has also been performed as the primary therapy in those unsuitable for surgery.Embolisation usually causes necrosis of the meningioma, which can cause some histological doubt when specimens are examined postoperatively.[2]Surgical removalThe tumour and its dural base are removed. Total excision is the aim but this is not always technically possible.Surgery may be complicated by invasion into local structures - eg, parasagittal tumours invading into the cerebral dural sinus.Stereotactic radiosurgery can provide excellent local tumour control.RadiotherapyRadiotherapy is used in the following:Incomplete resection.Following recurrence of meningioma.High-grade meningiomas with atypia or anaplasia on histology.In these clinical scenarios the use of radiotherapy is associated with a better outcome. For example, in one study stereotactic radiosurgery was associated with better tumour control (approximately 10%) and fewer complications.[12] However, a recent paper has shed some doubt on how useful radiotherapy is in meningiomas.[13]Stereotactic application of radiotherapy has further benefits compared with traditional radiotherapy. This includes less damage to undiseased tissue and better five-year control rates.[2, 14, 15]Radiotherapy is successful and may be used as the primary therapy for tumours, especially inaccessible meningiomas - eg, optic nerve lesions.[2]Chemotherapy and molecular agentsChemotherapy has so far shown disappointing results and has been reserved for when surgery and radiotherapy have failed to control the disease.Chemotherapeutic regimens involving hydroxyurea have been used but with little success.[16, 17]Other drugs studied include temozolomide, RU-486 and interferon alfa, which have also shown disappointing results.More novel molecular targets are being researched.[18, 19]PrognosisAtypical and anaplastic types of meningiomas can rarely metastasise.Completely resected meningiomas usually have an excellent prognosis. The five-year survival for typical meningiomas is more than 80%; however, this falls to below 60% in malignant and atypical meningiomas.[17]Are you protected against flu?See if you are eligible for a free NHS flu jab today.Check nowJoin our weekly wellness digestfrom the best health experts in the businessEnter your email Join now Please enter a valid email address.

Search Health Info Skin Cancer Types Features Added to Saved itemsWhen to worry about a mole Save Remove from Saved Print Share FeedbackGenerally, moles are harmless features of your skin, which will never cause any issues. But in some cases, UV exposure from the sun can cause a mole to change shape, size or colour and become cancerous. We explore what you need to look out for. Last updated by Natalie Healey Peer reviewed by Dr Sarah Jarvis MBE Last updated 22 Jun 2018 Originally published 22 Jun 2018 5 mins readWe're growing more aware of the dangers of the sun's rays and how important covering up and applying sun cream is, but melanoma skin cancer rates are still increasing. So it's important we all get into the habit of checking our skin regularly.""In the ‘good old days’, when a tan was a sign of a healthy outdoor life and holidays abroad were a novelty, many of us paid the price of wanting a tan. Some of us never got further than the peeling sunburn; some became addicted to sunbeds or spent every free hour in the sun. If any of those sounds like you, you need to be especially aware of the warning signs of skin cancer. But even if it doesn't, you need to look out for the signs,"" says Dr Sarah Jarvis, Patient.info's clinical director.What are moles?Moles form when pigment-producing cells in the skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. Most moles are flat, but sometimes they can be raised, and can range from pink, brown to black depending on your skin colour.""Most moles will develop on the body during the first 30 years of someone's life, and they can often change due to hormonal fluctuations. Moles are more common and prominent in fairer-skinned people, and may darken after exposure to the sun, during the teen years, and during pregnancy,"" explains dermatologist Dr Sharon Wong from the London Bridge Hospital, which is part of HCA Healthcare UK. Our picks for When to worry about a mole Your essential skin cancer checklistFollowing her diagnosis of a malignant melanoma, the Duchess of York has spoken about the impo... 5min Your essential skin cancer checklist 5min Why is skin cancer on the rise among older adults? 5min Should you wear sunscreen even when it's cloudy? 5min Why are men less likely to wear sun cream? 7minHow can a mole lead to cancer?UV light from the sun or using sunbeds can change the structure of a mole and increase the chance of it becoming cancerous. This is known as melanoma.""Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, which can spread to other organs in the body. The most common sign of melanoma is a change in an existing or new mole. The mole may also be larger than normal and can sometimes be itchy or bleed,"" reveals Wong.Of course, not all new, enlarged or changing moles will mean skin cancer. But you should keep an eye on them just in case.""Making a habit of examining your own skin on a monthly basis will help to detect any abnormal growths quickly. I always advise my patients to check their skin after they have had a bath or a shower, in a well-lit room with a full-length mirror,"" Wong adds.Jarvis says: ""Malignant melanoma can affect adults of all ages, and accounts for 90% of skin cancer deaths despite being about 20 times less common than other skin cancers. The biggest risk factor is skin damage, particularly from burning and especially in childhood. A combination of pale skin and a hot climate is particularly risky. Most moles are nothing to worry about, but see your doctor immediately if a mole changes or you don't pass the ABCDE test.""What to look forWong also recommends the ABCDE test, which is a handy guide to remembering what to spot.AsymmetryIs the mole symmetrical? Look out for changes in pigment, texture or shape from one half of the mole to the other.BorderA non-cancerous mole will usually have smooth, even borders, and you can see clearly where the mole ends and normal skin begins. You should look out for uneven formations and rough edges or lack of clarity between the edge of the mole and the skin that surrounds it.ColourMost non-cancerous moles are a single shade of brown, so if a mole is showing a number of colours this could be a warning sign.DiameterMelanomas are usually larger than 6 mm. If a mole is bigger than this you may want to consider having it checked out.EvolvingNon-cancerous moles don't usually change shape or appearance, so if one of your moles is starting to evolve you should definitely book to seek your GP. Also, be aware of any new symptoms such as bleeding, itching or crusting.But don't fret if you find the self-checking process tricky, or you've found some irregular moles or patches of skin. Book an appointment with your GP who will be able to review your moles and determine if any should be removed or investigated further.How to reduce your skin cancer riskStay safe this year and don't skimp on sun cream. Wong says you need to find one with good UVA and UVB protection. Both types of ray can cause damage to the skin and increase the risk of skin cancer. And cosmetically, UVA can age the skin, resulting in deep wrinkling and dark spots.And remember, there's no such thing as a healthy tan.""Unfortunately, there is still a perception within our society that having a tan looks 'healthy'. Due to this, many people apply low-factor sun cream when out in the sun, or don't apply any at all, in order to bronze their skin. I always advise my patients to use between factor 30-50 sun creams with 5* UVA cover, and to apply large amounts every two hours,"" says Wong.""I also advise that people should avoid sunbeds at all costs. The UV rays from sunbeds can damage the DNA in your skin cells, and over time this damage can build up to cause skin cancer. Fake tan products are a great option for people who want a darker skin tone, without the long-lasting damage,"" she concludes.Read nextWhat it's like to be diagnosed with skin cancerAre you protected against flu?See if you are eligible for a free NHS flu jab today.Check nowJoin our weekly wellness digestfrom the best health experts in the businessEnter your email Join now Please enter a valid email address.

Bad breath caused by germs (halitosis) In This Article Common Causes of Bad BreathIn this article What causes bad breath? Bad breath caused by germs (halitosis) What causes bad breath?Morning bad breathMost people have some degree of bad breath after a night's sleep. This is normal and occurs because the mouth tends to get dry and stagnate overnight. This usually clears when the flow of saliva increases soon after starting to eat breakfast.Dry mouth (xerostomia)Bad breath associated with a dry mouth is caused by a reduction in the cleansing mechanism of the mouth as a result of reduced flow of saliva from the salivary glands. There are many causes of a dry mouth contributing to bad breath. The most common cause is after a night's sleep (discussed above). Dry mouth may also occur:Due to a lack of fluid in the body (dehydration).As a side-effect of some medicines (for example, tricyclic antidepressants).As a symptom of some diseases (such as Sjögren's syndrome).Following radiotherapy to the head and neck region.Artificial saliva is available; all can be bought over the counter at pharmacies and some can be prescribed on the NHS for certain conditions.Foods, drinks and medicinesChemicals in foods can get into the bloodstream and then be breathed out from the lungs. Most people are familiar with the smell of garlic, spicy foods and alcoholic drinks on the breath of people who have recently eaten or drunk these. Various other foods and medicines can cause bad breath. This type of bad breath is temporary and easily cured by not eating the food.If a medicine is the cause of bad breath, then discuss possible alternatives with your doctor. Medicines that have been associated with bad breath include:Betel.Chloral hydrate.Nitrites and nitrates.Dimethyl sulfoxide.Disulfiram.Some chemotherapy medicines.Phenothiazines.Amfetamines.Lithium.'Water' tablets (diuretics).Bisphosphonates.Check the list of side-effects on the leaflet that comes with your medicine if you think it might be causing bad breath.SmokingMost non-smokers can tell if a person is a smoker by their breath. . Stopping smoking is the only cure for this type of bad breath. Smoking tobacco products also increases the risk of developing gum disease - another cause of bad breath.DietsCrash dieting or fasting can cause a sickly sweet smell on the breath. This is due to chemicals called ketones being made by the breakdown of fat. Some ketones are then breathed out with each breath. Low-carbohydrate and keto diets also can cause this sort of bad breath.Medical causesMedical causes, other than health problems in the mouth, are relatively uncommon. Possible causes include:Nasal problems. For example, a lump (polyp) in the nose or a small object stuck in a nostril (occurs most commonly in children) can cause a bad smell. In this situation, the smell tends to occur only, or more severely, when you breathe out through your nose. It is not so noticeable when you breathe out through your mouth.Sinus infections.Throat infections such as tonsillitis.Mouth infections, such as dental abscesses.Infections or tumours of the lung.Bronchiectasis.Reflux of acid from the stomach or a stomach infection called Helicobacter pylori.Diabetes.Severe kidney or liver problems.Fish odour syndrome (trimethylaminuria). This is a rare medical cause but worth being aware of. It typically causes breath and body odour that is often like a fishy smell. It occurs because the body loses the ability to properly break down trimethylamine which is found in certain foods. There is then a build-up of trimethylamine in the body which is released in sweat, urine and breath. Urine and blood tests can help to confirm this diagnosis if it is suspected.In these medical cases, there are usually other symptoms that would indicate the cause. For example, a blocked nose, sinus pain, chest symptoms, a high temperature (fever), etc. If you are otherwise well and have no other symptoms apart from bad breath, the smell is likely to be coming from a build-up of bacteria in the mouth and other medical causes are unlikely.Bad breath caused by germs (halitosis)In most people who have bad breath (halitosis), the bad smell is thought to come from germs (bacteria) and debris within the mouth.As the bacteria break down proteins and other debris in the mouth, they release foul-smelling gases. One or more of the following may contribute to the build-up of bacteria, debris and bad breath:Food stuck between teeth and gumsNormal teeth brushing may not clear bits of food which can get stuck between teeth. The food then rots and becomes riddled with bacteria. In addition to regular cleaning with fluoride toothpaste, flossing between the teeth (or using interdental brushes) can clear and prevent this problem.If you wear dentures, they should be removed and cleaned every night.Plaque, tartar (calculus) and gum diseaseDental plaque is a soft whitish deposit that forms on the surface of teeth. It forms when bacteria combine with food and saliva. Plaque contains many types of bacteria. Calculus is hardened calcified plaque. It sticks firmly to teeth. Gum disease means infection or inflammation of the tissues that surround the teeth. If your gums look inflamed, or regularly bleed when you clean your teeth, you are likely to have gum disease. The severity can range from mild to severe.There is some evidence that antibacterial mouthwashes (such as those containing chlorhexidine) may also be useful in preventing bad breath. Be aware that these may discolour your teeth or dentures. These can be bought over the counter.Coating on the back of the tongueIn some people, a coating develops on the back part of the tongue. It is not clear why this occurs. It may be from mucus that drips down from the back of the nose (postnasal drip). The coating can contain many bacteria. This explains why bad breath can sometimes occur in people with otherwise good oral hygiene. It is recommended that the tongue is cleaned every night with a proper utensil (such as a tongue scraper), rather than a toothbrush.Tonsil stones (tonsilloliths)Tonsil stones are are clusters of calcified material that form in the tonsillar crypts, or crevices of the tonsils. They are made up mostly of calcium but can contain other ingredients such as magnesium and phosphorus, and can feel like a small lump in the tonsils. Rarely harmful, they can be a nuisance and hard to remove and can often cause bad breath.Previous article Halitosis (Bad Breath)Are you protected against flu?See if you are eligible for a free NHS flu jab today.Check nowJoin our weekly wellness digestfrom the best health experts in the businessEnter your email Join now Please enter a valid email address.

When Should You Consider Botox Treatment for Your Overactive Bladder?FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail6 years ago| by Sheree McDonald Botox Treatment for Overactive BladderOveractive bladder (OAB) is the frequent or sudden urge to urinate with little or no ability to control urination.While OAB is not life-threatening, it can cause an enormous amount of embarrassment or hesitation to participate in regular activities. For some individuals, symptoms of OAB simply become a way of life. However, this does not have to be the case. There are treatment plans that will work.While some people may feel like they should suffer in silence, this is not an option you should consider. Know that proper diagnosis will help find the best treatment plan.Typical plans may include:Establishing a fluid intake scheduleLearning bladder-holding techniquesUsing anticholinergic drugsUsing Botox as treatment for overactive bladderThe last option may surprise you a bit. After all, most people use Botox to get rid of fine lines and wrinkles brought on by aging. However, the same properties in Botox that help firm the face can also be used to strengthen the bladder.How Botox for OAB WorksThere are a variety of medications for OAB symptoms that have been around for years.However, in recent years, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Botox as a treatment plan for individuals who do not respond well to traditional medications used for OAB. Some of these medications cause unfavorable side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and even memory loss.Essentially, Botox works to settle the nerves in the bladder muscle that are often overstimulated in individuals who suffer from OAB. The medication is injected directly into the bladder muscle for optimal results.Botox injections are convenient as they can be administered in your doctor’s offer in a matter of minutes. Afterward, you will be asked to wait for about 30 minutes and until you urinate to ensure that you do not have a reaction to the shot and that your bladder is operating correctly.A single Botox injection usually lasts up to eight months. However, your doctor will be able to evaluate the frequency of the injections based on your tolerance and how well your body responds to the treatment.The FDA does not have a suggested timeline for how long you should use Botox therapy to treat OAB, but they do suggest that each injection should be at least 12 weeks apart.Related Search Topics Control Bladder LeakageNatural Bladder ControlBladder Control SupplementsBladder Leakage Women You May Also LikeManaging the Emotional Impacts of OABBlogManaging the Emotional Impacts of OAB9 years ago| by Eric PattersonYou have to care for both the physical and emotional impacts of OAB because when one is left untreated, it negatively affects the other.Expected ResultsOf course, as with any treatment, results will vary. However, studies have indicated that most patients will see a considerable difference in symptoms in about two weeks following the injection.Incontinence is reported to have significantly decreased after one month following the treatment and often remains that way for at least a year.However, it is also noted that some people will have multiple injections per year while others will only have a single dose. Some of this depends on the severity of your OAB symptoms and how well your body responds to the treatment.Potential Side EffectsWhile many individuals have experienced a great benefit of using Botox to treat OAB symptoms, there are some possible side effects.The most notable side effects are that some people experience more urinary tract infections with prolonging Botox use. It should be noted that dry mouth, which is a common side effect in other OAB medications, is not linked to the use of Botox injections. However, other patients experience no side effects at all.What sets this option apart is that Botox injections are only done sporadically while other medications must be administered daily making it a much more convenient choice than different treatment plans.Speak With a Medical ProfessionalIf you suspect that you have OAB, you should discuss treatment options with your doctor. While Botox is undoubtedly an advantageous choice, this treatment plan is usually chosen if other medications do not work.Now, people have another option for relief of symptoms that interrupt their daily life. Speak with your doctor to learn more about the best treatment option for your situation.ResourcesMayo Clinic (Overactive Bladder – Symptoms and Causes)WebMD (Botox Eases Overactive Bladder, 2 Studies Find)Healthline (Botox for Overactive Bladder)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsOveractive Bladder Symptoms6 Causes of Overactive BladderOveractive Bladder LivingWhat to Know About Overactive Bladder in MenOveractive Bladder Living9 Ways to Reduce OAB EmbarrassmentOveractive Bladder LivingCan People With Overactive Bladder Enjoy a Cup of Coffee?Overactive Bladder LivingHow Do Pelvic Floor Exercises Help OAB?Overactive Bladder Living10 Ways to Stop Bladder Leakageyou may also likeBlog3 of the Best Yoga Poses to Improve Bladder FunctionBlogHow Pumpkin Seeds May Help Treat Overactive BladderBlogIs Cranberry Juice Good or Bad for Overactive Bladder?BlogBladder Training for Overactive Bladderconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsOABLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

2024-02-20 20:56:01,http://oabliving.today/blog/overactive-bladder-and-alcohol/,"Overactive Bladder and Alcohol - OABLiving.today OABLiving.todayMenuOveractive Bladder SymptomsOveractive Bladder LivingBlogSearchSearch Overactive Bladder and AlcoholFacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmail9 years ago| by Brenda Vanta Photo Credit: mjbs / istockphoto.comHow Alcohol Impacts Overactive BladderWhile the exact cause of overactive bladder is unknown, some foods and drinks appear to be more likely to irritate the bladder and aggravate the symptoms. On the top of the list of bladder irritants is alcohol, followed closely by caffeine-based products. Let’s review how your bladder works, the influence of alcohol and what other drinks or foods you should avoid to keep your bladder healthy and happy.How the Bladder WorksYour kidneys help filter waste products from the blood. They make urine, which is passed down to the bladder. The bladder is situated in the lower part of the abdomen and acts as a temporary store for the urine. It has muscles that allow it to expand as it fills with urine.When the bladder starts to fill up, the nerves that control it send signals telling you to go to the toilet. This simple mechanism does not work properly in cases of overactive bladder, leading to the characteristic symptoms.How Alcohol Influences the Urinary SystemThere are a few ways in which alcohol impacts overactive bladder symptoms. Firstly, it is a liquid and therefore will make you urinate more. It is also a diuretic, meaning that will make your body eliminate more fluids/urine from the body and do so faster than regular liquids and forcing the bladder to empty more often. And thirdly, alcohol irritates the already overactive and sensitive bladder, and may also have an impact on how the kidneys work.Additionally, the nerves that control the bladder emptying process may be affected by alcohol, thus making the bladder fill up without creating the sensation you need to urinate. As a result, leakages will occur. Lastly, alcohol reduces the quality and quantity of your sleep and makes you more likely to wake up and go to the washroom at night.Related Search Topics Control Bladder LeakageNatural Bladder ControlBladder Control SupplementsBladder Leakage Women You May Also LikeBladder Training for Overactive BladderBlogBladder Training for Overactive Bladder9 years ago| by Pat BratianuBladder training for overactive bladder is a widely used form of treatment.Different types of alcohol will create different problems. Among alcoholic beverages beer seems to cause more problems, compared with wine or hard liquors.If you drink more than that occasional glass of wine on the weekend, you should consider cutting down on alcohol. Not only your bladder will function better, but your whole body will be healthier. Set up small goals (i.e. drinking a few drinks less every week) and keep track of any alcoholic beverage you have.Count and measure the drinks, especially when drinking at home and you have a full bottle available. One standard drink is 12 ounces of beer, 1.5 ounces of spirits or 5 ounces of wine. Avoid “triggers” that make you more likely to drink – like certain people or certain places. Finally, try to eat some food with fat when you drink alcohol. This way the alcohol will be slower absorbed in the body, and therefore less irritating.Alcohol Is Not the Only ProblemReducing or even completely eliminating alcohol from your diet is a good step towards better management of your OAB, but that alone is not enough. There are other drinks that irritate your bladder and cause aggravation of your symptoms.Like alcohol, caffeine is a diuretic. It relaxes the muscles that control the bladder and thus will aggravates the symptoms of urgency and frequency. If consumed in excess and/or late in the day, caffeine will also interfere with your sleep, creating the similar problems during the night as the alcohol.If you go cold turkey and completely cut caffeine out, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, irritability and drowsiness. The best way to cut down on coffee is to gradually reduce its consumption: decrease the number of cups you drink during the day, combine full strength coffee with decaf or switch to green tea.Fruit juices are usually acidic (i.e. orange, grapefruit) and thus will irritate the bladder and make you have to urinate more often. Cranberry juice is known to be healthy and help prevent infections, but is also irritating to the bladder and is best avoided.When it comes to herbal teas, different plants will have different effects. Some have strong diuretic properties and should be avoided. Chamomile and ginger teas are safe choices due to their anti-inflammatory qualities, as long as they are consumed in moderation.Added sugar and artificial sweeteners can also trigger OAB symptoms. Bubbly drinks are not only carbonated, but loaded with sugar, encouraging the growth of bacteria and therefore the chances of infections. Many of them contain caffeine as well, and irritate the bladder, increasing the risk of urgency and frequency.Keeping HydratedNot drinking enough, can also be detrimental because the urine becomes more concentrated and more irritating for the bladder. But how much is too much? Rather than focus on those 8-10 glasses of water a day you’ve heard is healthy, you should check the color of the urine when you go to the washroom. If is very light yellow or white – and clear, you had enough water. If is darker, simply have an extra glass of water.Do you have to eliminate completely alcohol from your diet or just cutting down on it? Some people are OK having that occasional drink during the weekend. If you are not sure, try to not drink any alcohol for one week. If your OAB symptoms improve significantly, it would be a great idea to avoid alcohol altogether. If your symptoms don’t change, it means that you can probably enjoy that drink – just try to have wine or 40% spirits rather than beer, along with some food and extra water.ResourcesU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Tips for Cutting Down on Drinking)Guy's and St.Thomas' (Drinking Fluids and How They Affect your Bladder)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsOveractive Bladder LivingHow Do Pelvic Floor Exercises Help OAB?Overactive Bladder Living10 Ways to Stop Bladder LeakageOveractive Bladder LivingWhat Causes You to Leak Urine When You Cough?Overactive Bladder LivingNew Year’s Resolutions for People With OABOveractive Bladder LivingHow Can Kegel Exercises Help Overactive Bladder?Overactive Bladder LivingTips for Coping With Overactive Bladder at Nightyou may also likeBlog9 Ways to Stay Positive Despite OABBlogHow Pumpkin Seeds May Help Treat Overactive BladderBlogIs Neuromodulation Therapy an Effective Way to Treat Overactive Bladder?BlogThree Overactive Bladder Surgery Options Worth Looking Intoconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsOABLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Of this 25 million, 75% to 80% are women. Though urinary incontinence is most common in women who are over 50, approximately 24% of women between the ages of 18 and 44 experience some type of symptom too.Overactive Bladder SymptomsThere are a variety of symptoms that may signify that you may be experiencing OAB. These symptoms might include: the urge to urinate, loss of urine control, frequent peeing during nighttime and frequent urination. If any of these symptoms apply to you, it would be good to discuss this with your doctor.What Causes Overactive Bladder?OAB causes the muscles of the bladder to contract involuntarily. This occurs even when the volume in the bladder is low. When this occurs, there is an urgent need to urinate.These various medical conditions may cause OAB:DiabetesStrokeMultiple sclerosisUrinary tract infectionsHormonal changes, such as menopauseTumors or bladder stonesEnlarged prostate glandConstipationHow to Prevent Overactive BladderPracticing a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of experiencing OAB symptoms. If you smoke, it would be smart to quit. Also, make sure to maintain a healthy weight, get lots of exercise and limit your alcohol and caffeine intake.Related Search Topics Bladder Control in WomenIncontinence Treatment WomenBladder Control SupplementsNatural Bladder Control You May Also LikeManaging the Emotional Impacts of OABBlogManaging the Emotional Impacts of OAB9 years ago| by Eric PattersonYou have to care for both the physical and emotional impacts of OAB because when one is left untreated, it negatively affects the other.An Overview of YogaYoga, created from the Sanskrit word “yuj”, means “…to yoke or bind, and is often interpreted as ‘union’ or a method of discipline.”People in the U.S. and Canada download apps, follow YouTube classes and join yoga classes in studios or gyms. We’re perfecting our crow pose or resting in savasana. We’re practicing asana, or the physical postures of yoga.However, there are eight limbs of yoga:Yamas (restraints)Niyamas (observances)Asanas (observances)Pranayama (breath)Pratyahara (withdrawal of senses)Dharana (concentration)Dhyani (meditation)Samadhi (absorption)Depending on your own personal practice, the typical person may only be practicing asana, pranayama and dhyani.How Can Yoga Help Overactive Bladder?It is no secret that the physical practice of yoga is not only beneficial for our mental health, but also for our physical health. There are various yoga postures that may be helpful in improving OAB symptoms.Cobbler’s PoseCobbler’s pose is often performed during the warm up or cool down portion of a yoga practice, but it can be done anytime you feel like you need a good stretch. This pose benefits the bladder because it improves circulation in general. It also promotes circulation to the pelvis because of how the stretch is performed; because of the blood circulating to the pelvis, the nerves are better oxygenated.Here’s how to perform Cobbler’s pose:Sit on the floor or a mat, stretching the legs forward.Bending the knees, bring the soles of the feet together. With a straight back, grab the big toe and pull the feet as close to the perineum as possible.Hold the pose for one to three minutes.This pose is similar to butterfly pose, but the outside of the legs should remain on the ground.Reclined Wide-Legged Pose VariationThis pose helps with pelvic contractions, improving pelvic strength and bladder control. Not only does it assist with strengthening the pelvic floor, it can be incredibly relaxing, especially if you allow yourself time to rest.Here’s how to perform reclined wide-legged pose:Bring a mat flush to the wall. Lie on the mat with the buttocks against the wall, allowing the legs to extend upwards. Your body should be in an L shape.Place the hands on the low belly, spread the legs and inhale while the lower abdomen relaxes along with the pelvic floor.While exhaling, bring the knees back together.This exercise should be performed 10 times.Chair PoseChair pose builds strength in the pelvic floor while focusing on stabilization and alignment.Here’s how to perform chair pose:Grounding your feet into your mat or the earth, look down to ensure that your ankles and knees are aligned.Tuck your tailbone in, pull your belly button into the spine and slowly bring your bottom down to a sitting position.While “sitting”, your head should be in line with your pelvic floor.Gradually bring your arms up, palms facing each other.Hold for several breaths, then release, coming forward into a forward fold.Talk to Your DoctorIf you experience the mentioned symptoms and believe you suffer from OAB, make sure to talk to your doctor so they can guide you in the proper course of treatment.ResourcesAZO (Be Thankful: Yoga Can Help Bladder Control Issues)Mayo Clinic (Overactive bladder)Phoenix Physical Therapy (Urinary Incontinence Statistics)Yoga Journal (Yoga 101: A Beginner's Guide to Practice, Meditation, and the Sutras)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsOveractive Bladder LivingEffective Symptom Relief: Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation for Overactive BladderOveractive Bladder Living9 Ways to Reduce OAB EmbarrassmentOveractive Bladder Living13 Alternative Therapies for Overactive Bladder ReliefOveractive Bladder SymptomsIs Your Child Bedwetting or Do They Have OAB?Overactive Bladder LivingSeven Ways to Help Control an Overactive BladderOveractive Bladder LivingHow Can Kegel Exercises Help Overactive Bladder?you may also likeBlogWhen Should You Consider Botox Treatment for Your Overactive Bladder?BlogIs Cranberry Juice Good or Bad for Overactive Bladder?BlogHow Pumpkin Seeds May Help Treat Overactive BladderBlog9 Ways to Stay Positive Despite OABconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsOABLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Herbs reduce irritability of the tissues in the bladder and promote relaxation, and can also tone tissues and relieve inflammation.Here are some of the best herbs to use if you have OAB.1. Corn Silk (Zea Mays)Corn silk is my hands down favorite herb for relieving discomfort, spasms and irritability of the bladder. The simplest way to reap the benefits of corn silk is to buy fresh ears of corn, organic if possible. The silk that you need is the light colored part. The dried, brown silk is far less effective.Place a tablespoon or more of fresh corn silk in a cup. Pour one cup of boiled water over the silk. Place a cover on the cup and let the silk steep for 20 minutes before straining out the corn silk. Drink as mmuch of the light, slightly corn-flavored tea as you desire each day.Corn silk tea is also good for urinary tract infections. It won’t cure an infection, but you will experience fewer spasms, a decreased urge to void and markedly less discomfort within one half hour of drinking the tea.You may purchase tinctures or glycerites of corn silk for portable convenience, but I think the tea is superior. The glycerite is my second choice. Don’t use the alcohol-based tincture unless no other forms are available, as alcohol can make your OAB symptoms worse. Follow label instructions, if you are using a commercial product.NextRelated Search Topics Control Bladder LeakageBladder Control SupplementsBladder Leakage WomenNatural Bladder Control You May Also Like8 Tips for Getting Through the Holidays With OABOveractive Bladder Living8 Tips for Getting Through the Holidays With OAB8 years ago| by Angie FinlayGetting through the holidays with OAB can be overwhelming; follow these eight tips to manage your OAB without sacrificing your holiday spirit.FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsBlogIs Cranberry Juice Good or Bad for Overactive Bladder?Overactive Bladder SymptomsDiagnosing Overactive BladderBlogOveractive Bladder and AlcoholBlogThree Overactive Bladder Surgery Options Worth Looking IntoBlogWhen Should You Consider Botox Treatment for Your Overactive Bladder?BlogBladder Training for Overactive Bladderyou may also likeOveractive Bladder LivingWhat Causes You to Leak Urine When You Cough?Overactive Bladder LivingHow Do Pelvic Floor Exercises Help OAB?Overactive Bladder Living9 Ways to Reduce OAB EmbarrassmentOveractive Bladder LivingTips for Coping With Overactive Bladder at Nightconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsOABLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

While poor bladder control doesn’t cause any major health issues, it can lead to some pretty embarrassing moments. Leakage can occur due to an overactive bladder or urinary incontinence.The good news is that this condition is almost always treatable, and is most definitely not a necessary consequence of aging, childbirth, or an unavoidable part of being a woman.Types of Bladder LeakageThere are different types of incontinence:Stress incontinence – caused by laughing, coughing or being overweight. This type of incontinence happens when anything puts pressure on the bladder.Urge incontinence – when there is an intense urge to urinate, and unwillingly you release urine.A mixture of both stress and urge incontinence.Overflow – when the bladder cannot be emptied completely, and therefore it leaks unexpectedly.Causes of Bladder LeakageUrinary incontinence tends to be more frequent in women as pregnancy, labor, and menopause can trigger it. It can also occur to men, due to an enlarged prostate, diabetes, and other conditions such as Parkinson’s disease.10 Ways to Stop Bladder LeakageFortunately, this is a treatable condition, and lifestyle changes play a key role in helping to alleviate symptoms. Here are the ten most effective strategies for stopping bladder leaks.1. Pelvic Floor ExercisesBladder leakage is often the result of weak pelvic floor muscles, which can be strengthened. Kegel exercises are the most widely known technique for strengthening these muscles. Pelvic floor muscles support not only the bladder but also the uterus, small intestine, and rectum.These exercises can be practiced even during pregnancy and after childbirth to prevent incontinence. Results can be seen after a few weeks, but for best results, they should be part of your daily routine. Pelvic floor exercises can be done anytime, anywhere: while sitting at the office without anyone noticing, as well as lying down and standing.For women, there are even vagina weights to boost their effect further.2. Electrical StimulationMany individuals have trouble sensing their pelvic muscles, and they mistakenly activate their abdominals and gluteus instead.This is where electrical stimulation can help – by placing a small electrode inside the vagina or rectum and delivering an electric current, the pelvic floor muscles will contract.This therapy can be done at a doctor’s office, but also in the comfort of your own home thanks to home versions of these machines, offering a range of different strengths and time intervals.3. Increase fiber intakeThis dietary ingredient resolves constipation, which is one of the triggers of urinary incontinence. Fiber is found in:Whole-grain productsVegetables, such as avocadoPeas, lentils and other beansNuts and seedsAccording to the Institute of Medicine, general intake recommendations are 25 grams for women up to the age of 50 years, and 21 grams for those over 50 years. For men, the recommendations are 38 grams up to the age of 50 years, and 30 grams for those over 50 years. This is a very easy target to achieve, just think of a salad topped with flax seeds or pumpkin seeds.Most importantly, fiber works best when it absorbs water so make sure you drink plenty of water for your stool to be soft and formed.4. Avoid IrritantsCaffeine, alcohol and carbonated drinks have been shown to irritate the bladder and make bladder leakage symptoms worse as they make you want to urinate more. The same goes for energy drinks as they also interfere with brain signals and consequently when you need to urinate.Another dietary change is to avoid acidic, spicy foods and sweets. Acidic fruits such as lemons are found by some to worsen the condition so you should also avoid citrus teas. Ketchup and tomato sauces are a no-no, but surprisingly, even pineapple belongs to this group, and regrettably, chocolate has both caffeine and acid.Related Search Topics Control Bladder LeakageBladder Control SupplementsBladder Leakage WomenNatural Bladder Control You May Also Like6 Wonderful Herbs for Overactive Bladder TreatmentOveractive Bladder Living6 Wonderful Herbs for Overactive Bladder Treatment9 years ago| by Pat BratianuHerbs for overactive bladder can reduce irritability of the tissues in the bladder and promote relaxation.The choices you make greatly depend on your tolerance, so it may take a little trial and error to see what irritates your symptoms. For example, if you think caffeine is a problem, try switching to decaffeinated coffee for a while and see if your symptoms improve.After a trial period, try restoring regular coffee in small amounts and see if the symptoms worsen. You can do this will all possible irritants to see what foods and drinks worsen your symptoms.5. Maintain Healthy Vitamin D and Magnesium LevelsMany people are deficient in the sunshine vitamin, and studies show that women with sufficient vitamin D are less likely to suffer from pelvic floor disorders. The recommended daily amount is 600 IU.On the other hand, magnesium has been shown to ease muscle spasms and therefore help the bladder empty completely, resolving sleepless nights due to incontinence. Some magnesium-rich foods are:SesameBananasPotatoes and starchIf you opt for supplements, your doctor should be consulted first.6. Stop SmokingA chronic cough is common in smokers and besides being a risk factor for cancer as it aggravates the bladder and can worsen bladder leakage. Urge incontinence is three times more common in women who smoke than in those who do not, supporting studies that heavy smokers are at greater risk of incontinence.7. Hydrate ProperlyToo much water can worsen the condition; yet too little can also make it worse, as it could lead to UTIs. The recommendation is to drink smaller glasses of water at intervals throughout the day rather than sipping all day and to avoid drinking water at least 2 hours before bedtime.8. Reduce StressLearning relaxation techniques can also help in learning how to control the pelvic floor muscles and is therefore advisable.Learning how to breathe properly, meditate, or simply practicing mindfulness may be a good start as stress and an already troubled bladder are a bad combination.9. Train Your BladderTry following a strict bathroom schedule, such as going every few hours to prevent your bladder from overflowing. If you feel the urge to urinate before the scheduled time, try to hold it for a few minutes more by tightening your muscles so you can achieve longer periods between bathroom visits.10. Take Care of Your BodyBe active and maintain a healthy weight. When overweight, the pressure on the abdomen is greatly increased, as is the pressure on the bladder. Multiple studies have shown that walking or swimming for just 30 minutes a day may greatly improve bladder control.ConclusionAll of the above strategies work best when they are exercised continuously. Track your progress and make a note of any leaking to make the connection.No recipe is universal, and everyone has a unique formula for success, which is a lot easier to find once the cause of your bladder leakage is discovered.ResourcesWebMD (Types of Urinary Incontinence)NHS (Urinary Incontinence)Mayo Clinic (Urinary Incontinence)WebMD (Tame Your Bladder When You Have MS)Mayo Clinic (Nutrition and Healthy Eating)Urology Care Foundation (What is Overactive Bladder)Harvard Health (More on Strengthening the Pelvic Floor)Everyday Health (Can Smoking Cause Embarrassing Bladder Problems)Health Communities (Overactive Bladder Management)FacebookPinterestMessengerTwitterEmailComments Recommended PostsBlog3 of the Best Yoga Poses to Improve Bladder FunctionOveractive Bladder SymptomsOAB in MenOveractive Bladder Symptoms10 Treatment Options for Overactive BladderOveractive Bladder Symptoms6 Causes of Overactive BladderBlogHow Pumpkin Seeds May Help Treat Overactive BladderOveractive Bladder Symptoms10 Causes of Overactive Bladderyou may also likeOveractive Bladder Living8 Ways to Sleep Well Despite Overactive BladderOveractive Bladder LivingBladder Augmentation Considerations: Is Surgery Right for You?Overactive Bladder LivingWhat Causes You to Leak Urine When You Cough?Overactive Bladder LivingTreating Overactive Bladder Symptoms With Antidepressantsconnect with usPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseAbout UsContact UsOABLiving.today Copyright © 2024.

Usually starting out as small, benign polyps or growths in the colon, colon cancer has the potential to grow beyond control and spread throughout the body.[[1]] Colon cancer is treatable. With early detection from regular screenings, many people can identify colon cancer at an early stage and get lifesaving treatment in time to make a full recovery. One of the keys to early detection is to identify these 10 symptoms of colon cancer and to meet regularly with a doctor for cancer screenings. Persistent Diarrhea or ConstipationPolyps are growths inside the colon, and they may be small or large. They can irritate the bowel lining or block the flow of waste through the colon, which often causes noticeable symptoms. People with a bowel lining irritated by cancerous growths may struggle with diarrhea that lasts longer than a few days or comes and goes without apparent cause. Constipation is another common colon cancer symptom, as blockages or loss of function slow down the bowels.[[2]] Advertisement Recent Posts health 10 canker sore home remedies health 10 colon cancer symptoms health 10 constipation causes Changes to Normal Bowel MovementsApart from diarrhea or constipation, any unexplained changes to normal bowel function may be a sign of trouble. Having to defecate more often or less often, irregular bowel movements, or a sudden change in texture or composition could be significant.[[3]] There are many reasons why someone might experience a change in their bowel movements. Temporary or one-off changes usually arenât problematic, but any changes that cause distress or canât be explained might merit a cancer screening. Advertisement Advertisement The Urge to Defecate Without a Bowel MovementFeeling the need to defecate without an actual bowel movement is called tenesmus, and it can be a symptom of colon cancer.[[4]] If the feeling persists or happens often, it should be mentioned to a doctor. Occasional tenesmus isnât a worrying sign, and it isnât indicative of cancer if it happens on its own. However, it may require a screening if it occurs in connection with other colon cancer symptoms. Advertisement Cramping or Pain in the AbdomenColon cancer may cause pain or cramping in the abdomen.[[5]] Many conditions cause pain or cramping, including other forms of cancer, so on its own, abdominal pain isnât enough for a determination of colon cancer.[[6]] However, if the pain is severe, localized in the lower abdomen, or has no clear cause, it may be a symptom of colon cancer. This is especially likely if the cancer has advanced or spread beyond the colon. Advertisement Advertisement Feelings of Bloating or Being Full Without EatingColon cancer can occasionally cause unexplained feelings of fullness that arenât connected to actual food intake. This may be related to the endocrine effects of advancing cancer or the physical effect of having a mass growing in the bowel. Bloating is also a potential symptom of colon cancer. While itâs normal to feel bloated on occasion, such as after eating too much or during the menstrual cycle, it shouldnât be persistent or frequent without an apparent cause. Advertisement Changes in AppetiteCancer growth can send out chemical signals that affect the hypothalamus, which regulates appetite.[[7]] When this happens, a person may feel like they have lost their desire to eat. People lose their appetite for many reasons, including infections, colds, fatigue, or other health disruptions. Loss of appetite only becomes a warning sign if it persists beyond a day or so or there are other signs of cancer. Advertisement Advertisement Rectal BleedingRectal bleeding is never a positive sign, but it isnât always serious. People experience mild rectal bleeding for various reasons, including hemorrhoids or minor injuries, although colorectal cancer is also a potential cause. Unexplained blood from the rectum is always worth mentioning to the doctor, who will likely perform an exam. If it only happens once, it may be nothing serious, although repeated unexplained episodes call for immediate medical attention. Advertisement Blood on Stool or Tissue After a Bowel MovementPeople sometimes notice fresh blood on tissue or in the bowl after a bowel movement. This is often caused by hemorrhoids or anal fissures, and while itâs worth mentioning to a doctor, itâs not an emergency if itâs mild and rare. Persistent bleeding when passing stools is a problem, even if cancer isnât the cause. Frequent or routine bleeding associated with bowel movements should always be checked as a potential colon cancer symptom. Advertisement Advertisement Excessive or Severe FatigueEverybody feels tired sometimes, and itâs normal to have occasional bouts of heavy fatigue. If the tiredness is associated with a clear cause, such as exercise or a heavy meal, itâs probably nothing to worry about. Cancer can also cause excessive fatigue, especially in its later stages.[[8]] If a person frequently feels lethargic, or the fatigue or exhaustion interferes with their normal daily activities, a cancer screening may be needed. Advertisement Unexplained Weight LossWeight loss is associated with cancer for many reasons.[[9]] It sometimes results from diminished appetite, cancer treatments, or the cancer draining energy that would otherwise keep up a personâs weight. Weight loss isnât an issue if thereâs an obvious reason for it, such as a new exercise routine or diet changes. However, rapid, unexplained weight loss is never a good sign and may be a symptom of colon cancer.

Geschwüre treten als Folge von Missverhältnissen der Verdauungssäfte oder einer Beschädigung der Magenschleimhaut (z.B. bei Alkoholismus) auf. Ein Geschwür kann sehr schmerzvoll sein und ist daher kaum ignorierbar. Sollte man es dennoch unbehandelt lassen, kann es sich bis tief in die Magenwand fressen und zu einem perforierten Geschwür werden oder die Blutgefäße befallen, um sich in ein blutendes Geschwür zu verwandeln, was zu gefährlichen, extrem schmerzhaften Gesundheitsproblemen führen kann. Hier sind 15 sehr offensichtliche Anzeichen dafür, dass Sie möglicherweise ein Geschwür haben… 1. Magenschmerzen Abwechselnd brennende und stechende Schmerzen in der Magengegend – typischerweise zwischen Brustbein und Bauchnabel – können bei der Magenentleerung nach dem Essen entstehen. 2. Starke Verdauungsstörungen Ein Geschwür kann starke Verdauungsprobleme und Blähungsschmerzen mit sich bringen, die sich oft durch Aufstoßen und Schluckauf bemerkbar machen. 3. Übelkeit Aufgrund des Missverhältnisses der Verdauungssäfte stellt sich wahrscheinlich ein mehr oder minder schweres Gefühl von Übelkeit ein – insbesondere morgens bei leerem Magen. 4. Schwerer Bauch Oftmals fühlt sich der Bauch schwer und voll an, so, als hätte man zu viel Wasser getrunken oder trage ein Gewicht in sich. 5. Grippeartige Symptome Die meisten Betroffenen verbuchen Symptome wie Müdigkeit, Unwohlsein, Fieber und Übelkeit als Folge einer Grippe. 6. Appetitlosigkeit Die plötzlichen und starken Magenschmerzen, die bei Erkrankten üblicherweise auf die Nahrungsaufnahme folgen, verursachen oftmals Angst vor dem Essen oder sogar totalen Appetitverlust. 7. Unerklärlicher Hunger Entgegengesetzt ist es möglich, bereits wenige Stunden nach einem reichhaltigen Essen quälenden Hunger zu verspüren. Der Schmerz wird jedoch nicht von echtem Hunger verursacht, sondern ist Folge des Magengeschwürs und wird durch die vermehrten Verdauungssäfte verursacht. 8. Plötzlicher Gewichtsverlust Einhergehend mit Appetitlosigkeit tritt bei Betroffenen häufig eine deutliche Gewichtsreduzierung auf. Auch regelmäßiges Erbrechen als Folge des Geschwürs kann dazu führen, dass Sie deutlich an Gewicht verlieren. 9. Verfärbter Stuhl Die Stuhlfarbe kann dunkler oder heller werden und – im Falle eines blutenden Geschwürs – sogar einen Hauch von Blut enthalten. 10. Blut im Erbrochenen Erbrechen ist eine normale Folge eines Geschwürs und der sich daraus ergebenden hohen Menge an Verdauungssäften. Sollte das Erbrochene jedoch Blut enthalten, befindet sich das Geschwür in fortgeschrittenem Zustand und sollte umgehend medizinisch behandelt werden. 11. Völlegefühl und Blähungen Obwohl Menschen mit Magengeschwüren kurz nach dem Verzehr einer großen Mahlzeit ein unglaubliches Hungergefühl verspüren können (wenn sie denn essen), neigen sie dazu, recht schnell satt zu werden, und zwar normalerweise nach dem Verzehr von weit weniger Nahrung als sie es normalerweise tun würden. Zusätzlich zum Völlegefühl können Ulkus-Patienten Blähungen erleben, bei denen der Magen anschwillt, weil er mit Gas oder Luft gefüllt ist. Der NHS weist darauf hin, dass Blähungen besonders häufig nach dem Verzehr von fetthaltigen, z. B. gebratenen Lebensmitteln auftreten können. 12. Anämie Ein Symptom von Geschwüren, das schwieriger zu erkennen sein kann, ist Anämie. Anämie ist eine Störung, die auftritt, wenn dem Körper eine ausreichende Anzahl roter Blutkörperchen fehlt, um die notwendige Menge an Sauerstoff zu den Körperzellen zu transportieren. Aber wie genau sind die beiden Bedingungen miteinander verbunden? Nun, in einigen Fällen können Geschwüre bluten und, wie eMed-icineHealth.com erklärt, „aufgrund des anhaltenden, chronischen, langsamen Blutverlustes geht auch Eisen aus dem Körper (als Teil des Blutes) mit einer höheren Rate als normal verloren und kann zu einer Eisenmangelanämie führen.“ 13. Kurzatmigkeit Kurzatmigkeit ist eigentlich ein Symptom für Anämie, die durch den chronischen Blutverlust eines Geschwürs entstehen kann. Da eine Anämie jedoch schwieriger zu erkennen ist, ohne einen Arzt aufzusuchen, ist Kurzatmigkeit oft das, was am meisten auffällt. Kurzatmigkeit tritt bei Anämie aufgrund eines Mangels an roten Blutkörperchen auf, deren Aufgabe es ist, Sauerstoff zu den Zellen des Körpers zu transportieren, einschließlich derjenigen in der Lunge, wodurch das Atmen erschwert wird. 14. Gefühl der Ohnmacht Ohnmachtsgefühle, Schwindel oder Benommenheit sind weitere Symptome für ein blutendes Geschwür. Dieser ständige Blutverlust kann, wie bereits erwähnt, zu einer Anämie führen, die dazu führen kann, dass einer Person schwindelig wird oder sie sogar ohnmächtig wird. Sie tritt am häufigsten auf, wenn jemand versucht, schnell aufzustehen, nachdem er längere Zeit gesessen oder gelegen hat, und der Körper nicht in der Lage ist, genügend Blut zum Gehirn zu pumpen. Zusätzlich zum Gefühl der Ohnmacht, Benommenheit oder des Schwindels können Menschen, die als Folge eines Geschwürs eine Anämie entwickelt haben, auch Schwäche und übermäßige Müdigkeit verspüren. 15. Unwohlsein im Magen Menschen mit Magengeschwüren können auch Symptome erfahren, die denen von saurem Reflux und Sodbrennen ähneln. Und obwohl sie sich gleich anfühlen mögen, sind sie es nicht. Bei Menschen mit Geschwüren sind die Magenbeschwerden das Ergebnis der Verschlimmerung des Geschwürs durch die Magensäure. Die Säure neigt jedoch nicht dazu, aus dem Magen zurück in die Speiseröhre zu gelangen, wie es bei einem Säurereflux und Sodbrennen der Fall ist. Ein weiterer Unterschied zwischen den Erkrankungen ist, dass die Magenbeschwerden bei Geschwüren eher durch Essen und Trinken gelindert werden, während der Säurereflux in der Regel durch den Verzehr bestimmter Speisen und Getränke ausgelöst wird.
